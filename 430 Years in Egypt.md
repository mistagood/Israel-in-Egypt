# Israel in Egypt: A Concise History  
## Joseph, Moses, and the Pharaonic Timeline — Synchronized Biblical–Egyptian Chronology

This document presents a unified, historically anchored timeline aligning the biblical narrative of Joseph, Moses, and the Exodus with the established chronology of Egyptian Pharaohs of the 18th and 19th Dynasties. Each event is mapped to:

- Absolute BCE dates  
- Pharaohs and their regnal years  
- Joseph’s or Moses’ age at each event  
- Exact biblical quotations (KJV)  
- Egyptian historical context  
- Cultural/theological developments (Atenism, monotheism)  
- The Merneptah Stele  
- The Sea Peoples collapse  

Together, these elements present a coherent chronological, textual, and historical model integrating the biblical record with Egyptian dynastic history.
