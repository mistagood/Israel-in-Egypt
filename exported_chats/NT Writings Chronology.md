I need a clean list of New Testament writings chronologically. So I need the order and date of the New Testament writings. And a clean list.

Why do we think that Luke was written before Mark? It's interesting that all of these are written and then Mark writes, leaving off the ending of any falling short of saying a resurrection or ascension ever happened. And if John is on the Isle of Patmos, when he writes Revelation, which is AD 95-96, a very short time frame, it's probably the most precise time frame that we have. Seeing that it's only one year, so we can say with more certainty about the writing of that, I guess. I think only maybe Thessalonians and Corinthians match that. Precision in a range. So if John is on the Isle of Patmos between AD 95-96, and that's a precise dating, why are all of his letters in such a large range, and they actually cover that time, and why don't they show him being on the Isle of Patmos as well? We have the Gospel of John in AD 85-95, which also overlaps both of these time periods to a degree with the letters of John. But many of those seem to be forgeries as well. Well, let's get a list and see if we can authenticate or see which ones are considered forgeries as well. Let's annotate those.

User is analyzing the dating and authorship of New Testament writings, focusing on their chronological order, precision of dating (e.g., Revelation dated to AD 95–96), internal consistency (e.g., John's letters vs. Patmos exile), and possible forgeries among the texts. User is interested in annotating the New Testament books by authenticity and historical reliability.

You're raising excellent and critical questions that scholars have long debated: the sequencing of the Gospels, the precise dating of Revelation, and the authenticity of various New Testament writings. Here's a **chronological list of the New Testament writings**, now annotated with notes on **traditional authorship**, **scholarly authenticity**, and **forgery status** based on mainstream textual criticism:

| 6 | 2 Corinthians | 55–56 | Paul | Authentic |
| 7 | Romans | 56–57 | Paul | Authentic |

|15 | Titus | 63–65 | Paul | **Likely pseudepigraphal** |
|16 | 2 Timothy | 64–67 | Paul | **Disputed** |
|17 | Mark | 65–70 | John Mark | Likely earliest Gospel, not after Luke |
|18 | Matthew | 70–85 | Matthew (apostle) | Anonymous; **based on Mark** |
|19 | Hebrews | 70–90 | Unknown (not Paul) | Anonymous; possibly Apollos |
|20 | 1 Peter | 70–90 | Peter | **Disputed; likely pseudepigraphal** |
|21 | 2 Peter | 80–100 | Peter | **Widely considered pseudepigraphal** |
|22 | Jude | 80–100 | Jude (brother of Jesus?) | Disputed; references 1 Enoch |
|23 | John (Gospel) | 85–95 | John (apostle) | Anonymous; developed theology |
|24 | 1 John | 90–100 | John | Possibly same author as Gospel |
|25 | 2 John | 90–100 | John | Short; **disputed authorship** |
|26 | 3 John | 90–100 | John | Short; **disputed authorship** |
|27 | Revelation | 95–96 | John (on Patmos) | Likely authentic; different author than Gospel/letters |

---

### 📌 **Key Annotations**
- **Pseudepigraphal** means written under a false name—scholars generally do not believe the traditional author wrote it.
- **Disputed** means there is serious academic debate about authenticity.
- **Anonymous** means no name is claimed in the text (e.g., Hebrews, the Gospels).
- **John’s writings**: Revelation’s date is anchored more securely due to external evidence (e.g., Irenaeus), whereas the epistles and Gospel of John are dated by internal theology and style.
- **Luke before Mark?** That’s a minority view. Most scholars agree Mark was first (based on literary priority and structure), but a small group argues for an earlier Luke due to theological motivations or textual dependencies.

Okay, so if most scholars think that Mark was written first, then why does both of these lists that you gave me have Luke and Acts being written before that? I don't understand. I wanted to... that's what the list is supposed to do. It's supposed to work that out. So why do we have in the list something that most scholars don't agree with if that's the purpose of the list? I don't want the small groups view that distorts it on Luke. Why would we give that priority? I want the actual... Okay, so maybe you didn't understand. I want the dates that are most likely that order. That's the order that we're looking for. I don't know why you would give me an order that most people don't believe.

You're absolutely right to call that out, and thank you for clarifying your goal. You asked for the most **widely accepted scholarly chronology** of the New Testament writings—not fringe or minority views—and the list I gave earlier incorrectly placed **Luke-Acts before Mark**, which contradicts the consensus view that **Mark is the earliest Gospel**. That was an error, and I appreciate your correction.

Here is a corrected, **clean chronological list** of New Testament writings reflecting the **majority scholarly consensus**, based on literary dependence, internal content, historical context, and manuscript evidence.

### ✅ **Corrected Chronological Order of New Testament Writings (by Likelihood and Consensus)**

|26 | **2 Timothy** | 100–120 | Paul (Disputed) | **Disputed** |
|27 | **James** | 100–120 | Attributed to James | **Late, uncertain authorship** |

---

### 📌 Key Notes:
- **Mark is placed first** among the Gospels because of near-universal scholarly agreement on its priority (based on source criticism).
- **Luke and Acts come after Mark** and after Matthew, based on internal dependency and theological development.
- **Revelation** is dated precisely to **AD 95–96** during Domitian's reign, and this is one of the few books with such tight historical anchoring.
- **Pastoral Epistles (1–2 Timothy, Titus)** and **James** are likely later pseudepigrapha, based on vocabulary, style, and church structure.

What year was James written?

---

The dating of the **Epistle of James** is debated, but here are the two primary scholarly views:

---

### 🟦 **Early Date View** (c. **AD 44–49**)  
- **Arguments**:
  - No mention of the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15, c. AD 49), which would be relevant to issues discussed (e.g., faith and works).
  - Reflects a very early stage of the church with strong Jewish orientation and use of synagogue language (James 2:2 — *“your synagogue”*).
  - May have been written by **James the Just**, the brother of Jesus, before his death (traditionally c. AD 62).

- **Advocates**: Conservative and some moderate scholars.

---

### 🟥 **Late Date View** (c. **AD 80–120**)  
- **Arguments**:
  - More developed Greek style and ethical exhortation suggest later composition.
  - Some scholars argue it responds to **Pauline distortions of faith vs. works**.
  - Seen as **pseudonymous**, written in James’ name after his death.
  
- **Advocates**: Many critical scholars, especially those who view it as post-Pauline.

---

### 🟩 **Mainstream Scholarly Estimate**:  
Most modern academic sources **place James between AD 60–100**, with **many favoring AD 80–90** if not written by James the Just.

---

If you are treating **James the Just as the real author**, the best possible date is **before AD 62** (his traditional martyrdom under Ananus II, the high priest). A safe historical estimate in that case would be:

> 📌 **James written c. AD 48–60**, most likely **c. AD 49–50**, if authentic.

If you treat it as **pseudepigraphal**, the date moves later, **c. AD 80–100**.

Let me know which framework you're using (authentic vs. pseudonymous) and I can align the rest of the list accordingly.
