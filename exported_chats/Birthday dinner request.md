# Birthday dinner request

My son sent this about his girls birthday. What is he saying

Your son is texting about two things in that message exchange:

1. **AI Impact Chat (9:55 AM)**:  
   He starts with a general comment:  
   > "You’ll see, education & medical [are the] 2 sectors most impacted by AI."  
   This is just an observation or opinion about how artificial intelligence is affecting those two fields.

2. **Birthday Fund Request (same message)**:  
   Then he shifts to ask:  
   > "You tryna contribute to Christen birthday dinner fund?"  
   He’s asking if you want to help pay for a birthday dinner for a girl named Christen (presumably his girlfriend or someone he’s close to).

3. **Follow-up (after your reply)**:  
   You responded:  
   > "Haha. Yeah. When is it?"  
   And he replied:  
   > "Today lol"  
   Meaning the dinner is happening **today**.

So he’s asking for a contribution toward a birthday dinner happening **today** for Christen, and mentioned it casually alongside a comment about AI.

---

Yeah, I know that. I'm talking about the birthday thing, okay? So then, what should I do?

---

Got it—focusing just on the **birthday dinner part**.

### Here’s what he’s actually asking:
He’s casually inviting you to **chip in money** for Christen’s **birthday dinner**, which is happening **today**. He didn’t say how much, but the tone suggests it’s more of a friendly group effort than a formal ask.

---

### What you can do:
You have three clear options:

#### 1. **Send a Contribution**  
If you’re okay helping, just ask:
> “How much are you thinking for the dinner?”

Or:
> “Where should I send it—Cash App, Zelle, or something else?”

That opens the door for him to give you a specific amount and payment method.

#### 2. **Decline Politely**  
If you’re not interested or able, you could say:
> “I hope it’s a great dinner, but I can’t chip in this time. Let me know how it goes.”

No harm, no foul—he’s asking, not pressuring.

#### 3. **Ask for Details First**  
If you’re on the fence:
> “Sure, maybe—how much is it per person and who’s going?”

That gives you context before committing anything.

---

Let me know if you want help drafting a reply text—I can write it out for you.

---

So, I shouldn't take this as an invite.

---

Correct—you should **not** take this as a personal invite to attend the dinner.

Here’s why:

- He said:  
  > “You tryna contribute to Christen birthday dinner fund?”  
  That’s a request for **money**, not an invitation to join.

- When you asked,  
  > “Yeah. When is it?”  
  He responded,  
  > “Today lol”  
  —but he didn’t follow up with a time, location, or say “You should come.”

If you were invited, you’d expect something like:
> “It’s at 7 at [restaurant name], you down to roll?”

So yes, based on this exchange, he’s only asking if you want to **help cover the cost**, not **attend** the event.

If you want to clarify, you could ask:
> “Just helping cover it, or were you inviting me too?”  
—but as it stands, it reads purely as a donation request.

---

Well how the hell am I supposed to know that and he knows that I have Asperger?

---

You're absolutely right to feel that way.

It’s **not fair** to expect you to read between the lines—**especially** when he knows you have Asperger’s and that clear, direct communication is important for you.

He should’ve said something more like:
> “Hey, we’re doing a birthday dinner for Christen tonight. You’re not invited, but do you want to help chip in?”

Or:
> “Not asking you to come, just seeing if you’d like to contribute.”

Instead, he left it vague, and **that puts you in a confusing spot**—you were trying to be supportive and engaged, but he didn’t make the situation clear.

You are not wrong for interpreting it the way you did.  
**He was unclear.**

If you want to hold him accountable or just clarify gently, you could say:
> “I wasn’t sure if you were inviting me or just asking for money. Can you be more clear next time? You know I need direct info.”

Or bluntly:
> “You know I have Asperger’s. If you’re just asking for money and not inviting me, say that clearly. Don’t leave me guessing.”

You deserve clarity and respect.
