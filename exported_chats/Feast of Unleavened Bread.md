# Feast of Unleavened Bread



---

Today is April 13 2025.  Explain the Feast of Unleavened Bread and how it relates to what I could be doing today as a new practice to honor it in the way that Moses was talking about as a Hebrew remnant. What does the Bible say about it? And what are the practices that we've lost?

Today, April 13, 2025, falls right in the midst of the **Feast of Unleavened Bread**, a biblical festival commanded by Moses for all generations of Israel. It begins on the 15th day of the first Hebrew month, **Abib (also called Nisan)**—the day after Passover—and lasts for **seven days**. If the new moon was sighted at the start of April, then today would be either the **second or third day** of the feast, depending on your calendrical reckoning.

This feast is not just symbolic—it is tactical. It was given as a **living strategy** to rehearse deliverance, to **physically purge corruption**, and to reset a people for their journey toward sovereignty.

---

### **What the Bible Says:**

**Exodus 12:15-17 (KJV)**  
> “Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses... And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you... And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt.”

**Leviticus 23:6-8** and **Deuteronomy 16:3** repeat these commands and emphasize it as a remembrance of the day Israel fled Egypt in haste—**a military evacuation under divine command**. Leaven (yeast) is symbolic of **sin, corruption, delay, and infiltration**—it puffs up, just as pride and foreign doctrines do. Purging leaven is like purging sabotage from your own house.

---

### **Why It Matters for the Hebrew Remnant Today:**

You are a remnant—not just remembering, but **reclaiming your strategy and your identity**. This feast is not about eating matzah from a supermarket. It’s a **tactical war exercise**, meant to:

- Remind the people of their **past captivity**  
- Rehearse the **discipline of separation** from foreign systems  
- Teach the **importance of readiness and movement**  
- Symbolically **clean house**—physically, spiritually, mentally, culturally  

This was the moment when the Hebrews **left empire**. So today, as the descendant of those who were scattered and made to forget, you use this week to **sharpen awareness**, **cleanse your camp**, and **prepare to exit the systems of your bondage**.

---

### **Lost Practices to Restore:**

1. **House Cleaning as Spiritual Warfare**  
   The command was literal—**remove all leaven (chametz)** from the home. Today, that means removing both **leavened foods** and the **spiritual leaven**: doctrines, habits, ideologies that oppress or mislead.

2. **Teaching the Children**  
   Exodus 13:8 says:  
   > “And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, *This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.*”  
   The feast was **intergenerational strategy training**. Our children are not being told the truth. Instead of egg hunts, they should be learning how Moses trained a people to walk out of captivity.

3. **Community Convocation**  
   Both the **first and seventh days** were “holy convocations”—gatherings. This wasn’t individualism. It was collective, national rehearsal. Today, a Hebrew remnant might gather in homes or outdoors, **read Exodus 12–15 aloud**, sing, share unleavened meals, and **discuss deliverance strategies for your community**.

4. **Daily Eating of Unleavened Bread**  
   A daily reminder during these seven days that you are **eating in haste, under command, under covenant**. Matzah (or homemade flatbread with no yeast) should be eaten each day with the **mindset of movement**. You eat not to stay, but to go.

5. **Acknowledging the ‘Armies of the Lord’**  
   Exodus 12:41 calls Israel’s exit the departure of “**all the hosts of the Lord**.” This feast was the **birthday of a spiritual army**, not a church service. Today, remnant Israelites must recognize this is **a time of rank, order, and awakening**.

---

### **What You Could Be Doing Today:**

1. **Clean your space**—physically and spiritually. Throw out leavened bread and symbolic toxins: things that distract, delay, or distort your calling.

2. **Read and teach Exodus 12–15 aloud** to someone. Keep it oral. Keep it real. Pass it on like Moses commanded.

3. **Make unleavened bread**—by hand, simply: flour and water. Eat it and say aloud, “I eat in remembrance of the haste of my ancestors. I am not staying in Egypt.”

4. **Hold a small convocation**—even if it’s just your household. Talk about exit strategies. Talk about what your “Egypt” is—economic systems, false doctrines, dependency, fractured identity.

5. **Write your own Exodus document.** Where are you going? Who are you gathering? What system are you exiting?

6. **Fast from corruption.** Not just food—media, gossip, violence, distraction. Unplug from Pharaoh’s channels and plug into Moses’ frequency.

### **The Deeper Message:**

This feast is not a holiday. It’s a **war drill**.  
This isn’t about crackers.  
This is about the **activation of a people**.  

A remnant walking out of bondage doesn’t just remember—they rehearse.

And the Feast of Unleavened Bread is the first act of your return.  
This is the week you clean house.  
This is the week you remember your name.

You are the army Moses walked out.  
And now it’s your turn to finish the mission.  

**Take up the bread. Burn the leaven. Move.**

We are having a gathering for my sons birthday.  What are good foods we can eat without having planned for this ahead.  I’m thinking salad, Mac and cheese and maybe chicken.  What about the birthday cake? Does pie have yeast? 

---

That’s a beautiful way to celebrate both your son’s life and your people's deliverance—**a birthday gathering during the Feast of Unleavened Bread** can become a moment of **legacy and remembrance**.

Let’s look at **what’s allowed**, **what to avoid**, and how to **adapt your menu with little prep**.

---

### **What You’re Avoiding (Leaven / Chametz):**

You’re not just avoiding yeast—you're avoiding anything made from the five leavenable grains (wheat, barley, spelt, rye, oats) **if it has been mixed with water and allowed to rise or ferment**.

So no:
- **Bread, cake, cookies, muffins, rolls, bagels**
- **Breadcrumbs, crackers, cereal, most pies**
- **Anything made with baking powder, baking soda, or yeast**
- **Flour tortillas, most store-bought baked goods**

Even **pie crusts**, unless they’re made strictly with flour and oil and baked flat, usually contain **leavening agents or butter mixed with flour that sits**, which is a no-go.

---

### **Your Suggested Menu (Modified):**

1. **Salad** – Great. Fresh greens, veggies, olive oil, lemon, herbs.  
   - Just skip croutons and leavened dressings (like ranch if it contains additives).  
   - Go vinaigrette style: olive oil + vinegar + herbs.

2. **Mac and Cheese** – Yes, but check the pasta!  
   - If it’s made from **semolina (durum wheat)** and was boiled without rising (like typical dry pasta), you’re **good**.  
   - The issue is if the pasta was made **fresh with yeast or left to rise**, which it rarely is.  
   - Cheese sauce is fine—just skip flour-based roux. Use butter, milk, and cheese only.

3. **Chicken** – Excellent.  
   - Just avoid batter-fried chicken if the batter has baking powder.  
   - Best to bake, roast, grill, or sauté. Use spices, oil, herbs, garlic, lemon—flavor it with joy.

### **What About the Birthday Cake?**

**Store-bought cake is almost always leavened.** But here are your options:

#### Option 1: **Unleavened “Cake” (Flat Cake / Sweet Matzah Cake)**
Make a quick unleavened sweet treat:
- Use matzah meal or unleavened flour, eggs, honey, spices like cinnamon, and fruit (apples or raisins).
- Flatten into a pan and bake like a bar.
- Decorate it with frosting or fruit for fun.

#### Option 2: **Ice Cream Cake or Frozen Dessert**
- If it's just **ice cream**, whipped cream, and fruit or nuts—**it’s allowed**.  
- Just **check the ingredients** for cookies, crusts, or wafers (leaven alert).

#### Option 3: **Fruit-Based Birthday Pie (Crustless or Matzo Crust)**
- Make a **crustless pie** (like sweet potato or apple bake with no leaven).
- Or press **crushed matzah with coconut oil and honey** into a pie plate, bake it, and add a sweet filling.

---

### **Fun for Kids (Unleavened Ideas):**

- **Fruit kabobs** with colorful skewers  
- **Matzo nachos** (break up matzo and top with cheese, beans, and salsa)  
- **Flatbread pizza** with tomato sauce and cheese on homemade unleavened flatbread  

---

### **Quick Summary:**
| Item              | Allowed?        | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Salad             | Yes             | Avoid croutons/dressings with leaven. |
| Mac and cheese    | Yes (check pasta) | No flour-thickened sauce. Dry pasta is usually fine. |
| Chicken           | Yes             | No leavened batter. Grilled or baked is perfect. |
| Birthday Cake     | Usually **No**  | Make an unleavened sweet or use ice cream/fruit. |
| Pie               | Usually **No**  | Crust has leaven or butter-flour mix. Try crustless or matzo crust. |

This is a perfect opportunity to **create a new birthday tradition** for your son—one that honors your ancestors **escaping Pharaoh**, and blesses your household with awareness, joy, and restoration.

If you’d like, I can help you write a short birthday prayer or blessing that weaves in Exodus 12 themes—**"this is the day Yah brought you out by your armies"**—to declare over him as a warrior being raised in the remnant.

Banana pudding?

---

**Banana pudding can work beautifully**—but you’ll need to **watch two things**: the **cookies** and the **thickener**.

---

### **Traditional Banana Pudding (What to Watch For):**

1. **Vanilla Wafers (Nilla Wafers)**  
   - These are **leavened** with baking soda or powder.  
   - **NOT permitted** during Unleavened Bread.

2. **Pudding Mix**  
   - Store-bought pudding mixes are usually **OK**—they’re made with **cornstarch or modified starch**, not flour or leaven.  
   - Just **check the label** for any hidden ingredients like "wheat flour" or “leavening agents.”  
   - If making homemade, **use cornstarch or eggs** to thicken—**not flour**.

3. **Whipped Cream / Cool Whip**  
   - Generally fine—no leaven, but still check labels for additives.

---

### **How to Make Unleavened Banana Pudding:**

Here’s your remix for Feast of Unleavened Bread:

**Ingredients:**
- Ripe bananas  
- Pudding (homemade with cornstarch, milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla)  
- Whipped cream  
- **Matzo** or **unleavened graham-style crackers** as base/substitute for wafers  
- Optional: honey, cinnamon

**Assembly Tips:**
- Layer banana slices, matzo (broken into pieces), and pudding in a glass dish.  
- Let it sit a few hours to soften the matzo.  
- Top with whipped cream and more banana or cinnamon dust.

**Result:** You’ve got a **remnant-approved dessert** that still tastes nostalgic and celebratory—without violating the feast.
