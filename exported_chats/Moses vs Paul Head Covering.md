To answer “Which is holy, to have the head covered or uncovered?” we must look at the two teachings — Moses versus Paul — and compare them.

### **Moses (The Law and Holiness)**
In the Law given through Moses:

- **Covering the head was associated with holiness and priesthood.**  
  - The High Priest was commanded to wear a mitre (a holy head covering):
    > *“And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.”* — **Exodus 29:6**  
  - The sons of Aaron were to wear **bonnets**:
    > *“And for Aaron’s sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.”* — **Exodus 28:40**  
  - The covering of the head was **for honor, for separation, and for representing holiness** before God.

- **Even in mourning**, the priests were not allowed to remove their head coverings:
  > *“And ye shall not uncover your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die…”* — **Leviticus 10:6**

- **Nazirites and those under vow** would let their hair grow (symbol of covering). A shaved head represented defilement, and the covering was associated with separation unto YHWH:
  > *“He shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.”* — **Numbers 6:5**

**Conclusion under Moses**: Holiness = **head covered**, especially for men in service to God.

### **Paul (New Testament Letter to Corinth)**
Paul writes:
> *“Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.”* — **1 Corinthians 11:4**  
> *“But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head...”* — **1 Corinthians 11:5**

Paul **reverses** the pattern of Moses:
- A man must have his **head uncovered** to honor Christ (whom Paul says is his head).
- A woman must have her **head covered**, else she dishonors her head (the man).

But Paul’s justification is rooted not in Torah, but in a Greco-Roman gender hierarchy:
> *“For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.”* — **1 Corinthians 11:7**

This is in direct tension with:
> *“So God created man in his own image… male and female created he them.”* — **Genesis 1:27**

And again, Moses’ law **never** equated “uncovered head” with holiness for men.

### **Summary: Moses vs Paul**

| **Topic**                  | **Moses (Torah)**                                          | **Paul (Letters)**                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Men with head covering    | Required for holiness and priesthood                        | Dishonors Christ (head must be uncovered)        |
| Women with head covering  | No specific law, but modesty is expected                    | Required for honor; uncovered is shameful        |
| Source of authority       | Commanded by YHWH                                           | Based on "order of creation" (man's glory vs woman's) |
| Holiness associated with  | **Covered head, anointing, consecration**                   | **Uncovered head for men, covered for women**    |

### Final Answer:

According to **Moses**, holiness is associated with a **covered head**, especially for men in service.  
According to **Paul**, holiness (for men) requires an **uncovered head**.

Therefore: **Moses says holy is to cover the head**; **Paul says holy is to uncover it**.

If Moses is the standard (Deut. 18:15; John 5:46–47), then the **covering of the head is the holy way**.
