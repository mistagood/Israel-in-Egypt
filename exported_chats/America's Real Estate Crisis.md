# America's Real Estate Crisis



---

Help me work out this sermon on what's happening in America and how America will see its demise coming. There's a such thing as a density bonus in real estate and contracting which allows contractors to build more housing, more units in areas. And so this is going to be the thing that's going to allow China to take over American real estate because developers are able now to move right into neighborhoods that exist and instead of displacing people that are in them, they simply build more housing and the Chinese build housing and bring in their nationalists or their nationals. And since they have such an economic advantage, they keep the prices high. And so while people can't afford to live in the housing that's being built, they're building more and more housing for themselves and they'll soon outnumber and overwhelm to the degree that their smaller numbers won't be such a factor as they're growing because in places like Los Angeles, Atlanta, other places, you see the homeless populations are vast and growing. And so while the density bonus continues to grow because of the homeless population, the homeless are not the people that are being housed. And so we see that the homeless epidemic is really an excuse for the accumulation of overpriced housing that gentrifies entire cities, communities, neighborhoods while the housing market continues to be insulated. And the economic picture for Americans looks more and more bleak as their incomes do not keep up with the rate of increase in the cost of living, especially since the pandemic and the inflation of costs of all things from cars to gas to housing without any viable sources of income coming into play. And in fact, many being disengaged, disengaged. Many people were surviving from doing jobs like Uber Eats and such, but we know that these are disappearing and that was just a trap anyway because they found that they couldn't make money and often had to pay for the cars. And so now with automated drivers, it seems that Uber will finally become profitable, which was the only way that they would be profitable in the first place. And so that was always their plan. And so now millions of people who no longer go to regular jobs after the pandemic who were hustling will no longer even be able to scrape that living and the homeless will grow even more. As it is, many have turned into a lifestyle of living in campers and vans and cars, lying in the streets.

America is standing on the edge of a turning point, one that seems almost prophetically foretold—a slow and calculated shift that many don’t yet see, but that is taking shape in plain sight. This isn't a hostile takeover in the traditional sense; no armies march across borders or occupy land with brute force. Instead, it's a quiet acquisition, an economic invasion, leveraging the very systems that were once meant to empower communities.

Let’s take, for instance, the concept of a *density bonus* in real estate—a tool intended to bring more housing to those who need it. But what happens when this concept is co-opted, not to house the growing homeless or the middle class, but instead to serve a foreign economic agenda? We see developers building high-density housing, expanding units in places already stretched thin, and yet, none of it is truly accessible to the American populace. The pricing, bolstered by foreign investors, particularly from China, stays high, deliberately unaffordable. The wealthy foreign nationals who occupy these units gain a foothold, while Americans find themselves priced out of their own cities.

China, in this context, is operating with a strategic patience. With vast economic power, they keep the housing market inflated, their investments creating an economic bubble that is entirely unsustainable for the average American. As housing prices soar, the American middle class and lower-income families can only watch as new housing units rise around them—yet they remain unoccupied, cold monuments to an economy that no longer serves its own people.

This isn't a new tactic; it’s a subtle form of gentrification on a global scale. Just as neighborhoods were transformed, pricing out the very communities that gave them character, now entire cities—Los Angeles, Atlanta, and beyond—are being reshaped by foreign investment. Homelessness swells, yet these homes remain out of reach. The density bonus, meant to serve those in need, becomes a tool for profit and power, while real people are left to sleep on the streets or forced into mobile shelters, living in vans, campers, or even their cars.

And it's not just housing. The economic collapse in other sectors is accelerating the shift. Many relied on gig work—driving for Uber or delivering for DoorDash—to scrape by. These jobs offered a stopgap solution, but they were never meant to be sustainable. Now, automation is pushing even those minimal opportunities away. Companies that once touted themselves as disruptors of the industry now stand on the brink of profitability—by removing the very workers who made them possible. Self-driving technology edges closer, and those millions who relied on these side hustles find themselves once again without a foothold.

The American economy, already hollowed by inflation and wage stagnation, becomes more fractured, more fragile. The people who were once the backbone of this country—the middle and working classes—are systematically being displaced. Meanwhile, foreign investors are laying the groundwork for a takeover that comes not through might, but through money.

This is a warning and a call to recognize that what’s happening here is not a natural cycle. It is a structured and strategic shift, a deliberate move that stands to redefine what it means to be American, what it means to call this land home. Will we stand by as entire cities are priced out of reach, as communities are transformed beyond recognition? Or will we take a stand, refusing to let foreign interests slowly but surely price us out of our own inheritance?

As believers, we see in this a spiritual lesson: a warning against complacency, a call to wake up to the tides shifting around us. This is more than an economic issue; it’s about the survival of a people, a culture, and a legacy. The question remains—will we heed the signs, or will America, through its own systems, allow itself to be overtaken from within? The hour is late, and the call to action is now.

What are the forces that are driving this? It's none other than ignorance, hatred, and greed. The same forces that have always shaped America. And if it doesn't turn around now, it's the end. So how are the Chinese able to do this? Well, with the help of the American people, the people who support the higher housing, who will move to the neighborhoods, who tacitly or openly accept that paying higher rent in these neighborhoods allows them to be away from other people and to keep the neighborhood exclusive. So the idea that you can keep the riffraff away by paying more is the racism that's built into America, the red lining that drove this system from the beginning. And so because of this tendency in America, the Chinese are able to take advantage of it. And so the very few who will be able to sustain these kinds of incomes until the Chinese decide to plunge the market and dissolve the wealth or call in the debts of America, they'll then find themselves in a precarious situation. The problem is that we have such a hatred in this country growing that many people would rather destroy it than to see natives or former slaves retain the country or what should be their inheritance. And so it's a matter of what Solomon witnessed in the Bible when two ladies were arguing over a baby. The lady who the baby was never really hers, she didn't care about the destruction of it as long as she got her share. But if she couldn't have it, then nobody could. And this is simply a case of if we can't have it, then nobody can. They'll bring the Chinese in, they'll bring in immigrants from Europe as they did when slavery was about to end to make sure that they can fill in those gaps so that the people who have been enslaved on their own land and enslaved in this land would not have the opportunity to get the land that they deserved. And so this is the destruction of America either way. The question then becomes which side of the destruction people choose to be on. Because there is a higher power at work that out of all destruction something beautiful and shining will remain. And so that's the gold that comes out of the furnace, out of the forge. And so in these end times of the fiery furnace, a new kingdom is being forced, a new society of people. And those will be the people who take the lead now in understanding and operating with knowledge, intelligence, love, compassion, and certainly and foremost, the wisdom that's been given to us.

America is caught in a cycle of ignorance, hatred, and greed—the very forces that have shaped its history from the beginning. This isn’t just a recent problem but a foundational flaw, a sickness that, if left unchecked, will inevitably bring about America’s own undoing. These forces have created an environment ripe for exploitation, allowing powers like China to move in, and it’s not happening without the help of the American people themselves. Many tacitly support the rising cost of housing, willing to pay higher prices for the promise of exclusivity and separation, believing that by paying more, they can shield themselves from others. This desire for separation and superiority is nothing less than the deeply rooted racism that has defined American real estate for generations.

Consider redlining—a system built to restrict access, a system that created racial and economic boundaries across neighborhoods. Today, these boundaries are merely reborn in the form of soaring rents and high-end developments. Those who are willing to pay these prices sustain a market that is increasingly inaccessible to the everyday American. And through this very mechanism, foreign investors see an opportunity. They come in, exploit the division, and fill the gaps created by an America that insists on keeping its “others” out.

And what of those who support this structure, knowingly or unknowingly? In their drive to keep certain groups out, to secure their own space at any cost, they become complicit in the very process that will ultimately destabilize them. When China—or any foreign power with leverage—decides to cash in, to call in debts or devalue the market, those who thought they were secure in their gated lives will find themselves in a precarious situation. The illusion of security will vanish, and the very systems they upheld will collapse on them, leaving a hollowed-out economy and a broken society.

This is the same tragic irony we see in the story of King Solomon when two women claimed a child. The true mother was willing to sacrifice her own claim to save the child’s life, while the false mother, whose attachment was only in appearance, would rather see the child divided than relinquished. America stands in a similar place—those who truly care for the soul of this nation, those with a rightful claim and an investment in its future, will make sacrifices for its healing. But there are those, fueled by hatred and envy, who would rather see the country destroyed than see it returned to those whom it truly belongs. They would rather see it fall apart than witness former slaves or indigenous descendants rise to claim their inheritance. 

And so America becomes that child under Solomon’s judgment, divided by those who would rather destroy it than lose their grip on the illusion of control. The powerful have done this before, bringing in immigrants from Europe as a counterbalance when slavery was about to end, filling the labor gap, keeping the newly freed slaves from gaining a true foothold. Now, this cycle repeats, as foreign investments and new populations enter not to integrate but to control, while many Americans still buy into a system designed to divide and exploit.

The question isn’t whether America will be destroyed; it’s about which side of the destruction each of us will stand on. There is a higher power at work, refining and reshaping even through this chaos. Out of all destruction comes transformation, as gold is purified through fire. And as we pass through this fiery furnace, there will emerge a new people, a new community grounded not in ignorance or hatred but in wisdom, love, and compassion. This new society will be built by those who see beyond the divisions, who understand the lessons of history and embrace true unity.

This is America’s crucible moment. As the fires of greed and hatred rage, something new and pure is being forged. Out of the ashes, a remnant will rise—a people who embody the wisdom, strength, and love that this country so desperately needs. In these times of fiery testing, a new kingdom is being prepared. Those who step forward with courage, intelligence, and compassion, those who recognize the truth and act on it—these will be the ones to inherit the future, to lead, and to rebuild on a foundation of true justice and peace.

That’s pretty darn good 😊. Let’s revamp it from the top with all of that and I want to use the baby and Solomon‘s mad as a big metaphor throughout this whole thing so that baby is America or the land the promised land OK that’s all I wanna break that down as the biggest tell that story from the beginning and then kick into the sermon and let that lead and keep coming back to that as though that we’ve that into it so that that becomes a powerful analogy in the end that people will take away, so that’s great both of those segments that we just had all into one beautiful comprehensive sermon it can be much longer as needed. In fact, it will have to detail it out.

In the days of Solomon, two women came to the king, each claiming to be the mother of a newborn child. It was a high-stakes conflict, one that would test the wisdom of the king and the hearts of those involved. Each woman desperately laid claim to this child, yet their motivations could not have been more different. One was the child’s true mother, bound by an unbreakable love. The other, detached and bitter, only desired a share of the child, even if it meant splitting him in two. She was willing to watch the child perish rather than surrender her claim, revealing a dark truth: when faced with loss, she would rather destroy than let go.

And in this ancient scene, we find an echo of America’s story today—a land caught between two competing visions, two irreconcilable desires, two mothers if you will. On one side are those who are deeply connected to this land and its true spirit, those who care for its soul and are willing to make sacrifices for its survival. On the other side are those who cling to it only for what they can take from it, driven by greed, hatred, and ignorance. Like the false mother, they would rather see America divided and destroyed than concede any portion of it to others they deem unworthy. This child, this America, is caught in the hands of both, and only the wisdom of God can untangle its future.

Consider this child as the Promised Land—a land whose true inheritance was meant for a people forged in struggle, a people who came through fire and water, through slavery and oppression, yet who remained steadfast in their hope. But over time, others arrived, drawn by the wealth of this land, yet uninvested in its deeper promise. They set boundaries, drew lines, and built walls, redlining neighborhoods, creating divisions that would grow into chasms. And now, in our present day, these divisions have festered into a system ripe for exploitation.

Just as the false mother was willing to divide the child, there are forces today willing to divide America. These forces, powered by foreign interests and domestic greed, exploit our divisions, our history of racial and economic separation, to drive a wedge even deeper into the land’s soul. Look at the housing market—once a cornerstone of the American dream, now transformed into a mechanism of control and profit. Developers, backed by foreign investments, particularly from China, use systems like the *density bonus*—originally intended to create affordable housing—to build more units that remain inaccessible to ordinary Americans. They build high, they build wide, but they don’t build for us. Instead, they price these homes beyond reach, ensuring they serve only those who can afford exclusivity. Like the false mother, they care nothing for the child itself but only for the opportunity to take what they can.

And who benefits from this? Foreign powers see the cracks in our foundation, and they push deeper. They buy properties, inflate prices, and bring in their own, expanding their presence while everyday Americans find themselves priced out. People who once built these communities now struggle to survive within them. But those who support this system, knowingly or unknowingly, bear their share of the blame. By paying these exorbitant prices, by buying into the illusion of exclusivity, they become complicit in the same scheme that will ultimately disenfranchise them.

It’s the same trap, laid out time and again. During slavery’s end, immigrants were brought in to ensure newly freed slaves couldn’t gain a foothold in the economy. Now, as cities swell and housing prices climb, we’re watching a repeat of history. The developers and investors care nothing for the homeless Americans who populate our streets. They care only for profit and power, and those who pay their prices feed into this greed. They imagine themselves safe, but like the false mother, they stand ready to divide the child if it means they can keep their piece.

This is America’s tragic irony—its own people are aiding in its division, caught in a cycle of greed and exclusivity that pushes its true heirs to the fringes. And when the day comes, when foreign powers decide to cash in on their investments, to call in debts, those who thought themselves secure will be left to watch the collapse. Like the false mother, they will have destroyed the child they claimed to love, while those who truly cared for its soul will be the ones to suffer.

But here is the truth: God sees through all of this. Just as Solomon saw through the false mother’s heart, God knows the real motives behind those who stake a claim on this land. And just as Solomon revealed the true mother through her willingness to sacrifice, America will reveal its true children—the ones willing to give of themselves, the ones who care for the spirit of this land rather than the profits it yields. 

This is America’s crucible moment. We are in the fiery furnace, where the dross of hatred and greed must be burned away. We are witnessing a refinement—a time when the true and the false will be separated. For out of this furnace will come a new people, a remnant that embodies wisdom, compassion, and love. And though it may seem that this land is on the brink of destruction, know that God is working through this process. For even out of the ashes, something beautiful will rise.

This is a call to choose the side of truth, to be among those who care for the child, who love this land not for what they can take but for what they can build. In the end, America will not be saved by the wealthy, the powerful, or the indifferent. It will be saved by those who love it as the true mother loved her child, who would rather sacrifice than see it destroyed. The time has come to lay down greed, to let go of hatred, and to embrace a vision that transcends divisions. This land will be preserved, but only by those who are willing to nurture it, to heal it, and to stand as stewards of its true promise. 

May we be counted among them, among those who love not to divide but to unite, not to exploit but to build. This is the wisdom of Solomon for America today: that we will not let this child be torn apart by greed and ignorance. We will rise, as gold refined in the fire, to reclaim this land with hearts of love, with hands that heal, and with spirits that see beyond divisions. And may this new nation, forged in the furnace, shine as a light—a testament to the power of a people united in love and truth.

In the days of King Solomon, there came a test that would reveal the depth of his wisdom—a test rooted in the claim to a single, innocent child. Two women, each desperate, each determined, stood before him, each asserting the child was hers. And in this scene, Solomon recognized more than a simple dispute; he saw the truth that lay behind their words, a truth that would only be uncovered through a test. One mother’s love was pure, selfless, ready to sacrifice everything for the well-being of her child. The other’s claim was only a grasp for possession, a claim that would rather see the child destroyed than let go. Solomon, with piercing insight, proposed that the child be divided. In that moment, the true mother’s heart was laid bare, for she chose to relinquish her claim to save her child. And in this story, we find a metaphor for America today—a land once held as a sacred promise, yet now caught in a bitter struggle over its future.

America is that child, born with promise, nurtured by those who have given their lives and labor to see it thrive. But like the child before Solomon, America now finds itself held by two competing forces. On one side are those who love it selflessly, who sacrifice daily to see its potential realized, who see its promise not in terms of possession or profit but in terms of purpose. These are the true heirs of America, those who seek its welfare over personal gain, those willing to make sacrifices that ensure a future for all. On the other side stand those who have staked their claim out of greed and self-interest, who care not for the soul of this land but for what they can extract from it. Like the false mother, they would rather see America divided, stripped, and sold if it means they retain their hold.

Look at the system that has been built around us—a system that takes this land, divides it, and sells it to the highest bidder, often to those who have no connection to its spirit. Redlining, gentrification, inflated real estate—these are tools not of unity but of division. They are the sword that threatens to divide the child. And in recent years, this blade has been wielded with growing fervor, slicing through communities, separating families, driving out the very people who have tended to America’s spirit.

Consider the housing market today—a marketplace transformed from a path to prosperity into a weapon of economic control. Developers, backed by foreign investments, particularly from China, are using tactics like the *density bonus* to expand housing, not for the people but for profit. This density bonus was originally meant to serve the people, to provide affordable housing to those in need. But in the hands of those driven by greed, it has become a tool for exploitation. They build high-rise upon high-rise, pricing these units beyond the reach of everyday Americans, ensuring they remain out of touch for those who built the neighborhoods in the first place.

And who fills these spaces? Foreign investors, foreign nationals, often moving in under the radar, claiming pieces of America one development at a time. They inflate the market, keeping prices high, making it impossible for the average American family to keep pace. These forces don’t come with armies; they come with cash. They come through systems that Americans themselves have allowed to flourish, feeding off a culture of exclusivity and division. For those who pay the high prices, who buy into the promise of exclusivity, they are unwittingly playing into the hands of those who care nothing for the soul of America. They are paying for their own displacement, supporting the very system that threatens to cut them off from their own roots.

In this, we see the shadow of Solomon’s test. The sword is raised, the blade gleams, and the choice becomes clear. Do we choose to divide the child, to cut America apart in the name of profit, control, and greed? Or do we, like the true mother, make sacrifices, choosing to lay down our claims, our illusions of possession, for the sake of a unified future? 

This cycle is not new. In America’s past, as slavery neared its end, immigrants from Europe were brought in to fill the labor gap, ensuring that newly freed slaves would not have an easy path to inheritance or land ownership. Now, as prices soar, as gentrification takes hold, we see history repeating. Communities that have given their blood, sweat, and tears to build this nation are being driven out, priced out, forced out of neighborhoods their families have known for generations. Foreign investors come in, exploiting the cracks in America’s foundations, dividing the child yet again.

And yet, even as America’s foundations are shaken, there remains a choice. Those who truly love this land, those who see it as more than just a marketplace, can choose a different path. They can choose to stand for something greater. They can see through the empty promises of exclusivity and division, recognizing them for the lies that they are. They can stand up, not with fists but with hearts open, committed to a vision of America that serves all its people, that embraces its diversity, that lives up to its true promise.

The time has come for America to face its test, to decide who it truly is. Like Solomon, we must have the wisdom to discern who truly loves this child, who truly loves this land. For if we allow ourselves to be divided by greed, by hatred, by ignorance, we will only ensure our own undoing. But if we choose to unite, to sacrifice, to protect the soul of this land, we will pass through this furnace refined, like gold tested in fire.

Out of this fiery trial will emerge a new people, a remnant bound not by greed but by love, not by division but by unity. They will be the ones who have passed through the crucible, who understand the true cost of America’s promise. These are the people who will inherit the future, who will rebuild not on foundations of profit but on pillars of compassion, wisdom, and justice.

Let us be like the true mother, willing to sacrifice, willing to let go of our illusions of ownership, willing to share the promise of this land. Let us love America not for what we can take from it but for what we can give to it, for how we can see it flourish for generations to come. In the end, the real test is not about who holds the land but about who cares for its spirit, who is willing to nurture its soul, who will sacrifice to ensure that it remains whole.

This is the call, this is the challenge—to love America enough to save it from division, to be the true heirs of its promise, the stewards of its spirit. In this choice, we find our own redemption. We find our own purpose. And we become part of a legacy that will shine through the ages, a testament to a people who chose unity over division, compassion over greed, love over hatred.

May we be those people. May we rise to this calling. And may America, like the child before Solomon, find its true mother, the one who will not let it be divided, the one who will see it flourish, the one who understands that its promise is not in possession but in purpose. And as we pass through this test, may we emerge as a nation refined, united, and ready to inherit a future that shines with the light of true justice, true love, and true wisdom.
