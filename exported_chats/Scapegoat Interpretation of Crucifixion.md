# Scapegoat Interpretation of Crucifixion



---



---

Build an argument based around Ezekiel 12 and Jesus Christ statement about all of his disciples, forsaken him that night. The argument puts forth that Jesus is the scapegoat in the atonement ritual rather than performing a crucifixion and resurrection. Jesus never died on the cross, and was not crucified and that Judas was crucified. Jesus was taken out through the hole in the wall with the help of pilot, Nicodemus, Joseph, Arimathea, and others. Ezekiel 12 describes the prophecy of the prince, and what will happen at the cross, and strength of the argument will be connecting to Jesus, his statements and the apostle‘s abandoning him the night of the crucifix or supposed crucifixion. This linguistic clue links Jesus as referring to Ezekiel 12 when the prince goes out , so analyze his statements and the events that happened and Ezekiel 12. Put the verses in context , give descriptions and quote the verses.

Certainly, let's delve into this alternative interpretation of the events surrounding Jesus Christ and Judas, particularly in relation to Ezekiel 12. This interpretation posits that Jesus is the scapegoat in the atonement ritual, as described in Leviticus 16, and that Judas was the one crucified, not Jesus. The argument will be built around Ezekiel 12 and Jesus' statement about his disciples forsaking him.

### Ezekiel 12: The Prophecy of the Prince

Ezekiel 12 describes the prophecy of the prince who will dig through the wall and cover his face so that he cannot see the land. He will go out at dusk, carrying his belongings on his shoulder.

**Ezekiel 12:12 (NIV)**
> "The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land."

#### Commentary

The prince in Ezekiel 12 is often interpreted as Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, who tried to escape Jerusalem when it was under siege. However, the text can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus, the ultimate Prince of Peace. The act of going out at dusk with belongings on his shoulder can be symbolic of Jesus carrying the weight of humanity's sins as the scapegoat.

### Jesus' Statement: Disciples Will Forsake Him

**Matthew 26:31 (NIV)**
> "Then Jesus told them, 'This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."'"

#### Commentary

Jesus predicts that his disciples will abandon him, much like the subjects of the prince in Ezekiel 12. This abandonment is crucial in the unfolding of events that lead to the supposed crucifixion. The disciples' desertion can be seen as a necessary step for Jesus to fulfill his role as the scapegoat, carrying away the sins of the people.

### The Night of the Supposed Crucifixion

#### Commentary

The Gospels describe how Jesus was arrested and brought before the Sanhedrin and Pilate. However, in this interpretation, it's Judas who is crucified as a sin offering. Jesus, on the other hand, is secretly released by Pilate, perhaps with the help of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. This aligns with the prophecy in Ezekiel 12, where the prince leaves through a hole in the wall, his face covered, symbolizing Jesus' discreet exit.

### Linguistic Clues: Jesus Referring to Ezekiel 12

When Jesus states that his disciples will forsake him, he is possibly alluding to the prophecy in Ezekiel 12. The act of forsaking aligns with the subjects of the prince in Ezekiel abandoning him, thereby allowing him to fulfill his role as the scapegoat.

### Conclusion

The strength of this argument lies in the parallelism between Ezekiel 12 and the events surrounding Jesus and his disciples. By viewing Jesus as the prince prophesied in Ezekiel and the scapegoat in the atonement ritual, a new layer of understanding is added to these significant biblical events. This interpretation challenges traditional views and offers a plausible alternative that aligns with the mystic implications of the text.

Leave out the conclusion we’re gonna keep working on this. You need to tie in the verses in Ezekiel 12, which describe the princes staff abandoning him. You mentioned it in the statement above, but provided no evidence from the text. Let’s go deeper. We will analyze the entire chapter 12 line by line relating it to Jesus, and how Ezekiel is being shown by doing it in the daytime when people can clearly see, but then doing it again at dusk, that there will be two events, and that the true significance will not be understood until later. This is akin to where Jesus says that there are 12 hours in the day and 12 hours at night the things you do in the day are we seen by men and the things at night will be revealed later. This is a paraphrase from the book of John get the quote use this comparison as well. 

---

Certainly, let's delve deeper into Ezekiel 12 and its parallels with the events surrounding Jesus, particularly focusing on the dual events in daytime and dusk, and the abandonment by the staff or subjects.

### Ezekiel 12:1-2
**Verses:**
> "The word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.'"

#### Commentary:
This introduction sets the stage for a message aimed at a people who are spiritually blind and deaf, much like the Pharisees and religious leaders in Jesus' time who failed to recognize him as the Messiah.

### Ezekiel 12:3-6
**Verses:**
> "Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile. While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it. Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites."

#### Commentary:
Ezekiel is instructed to enact a symbolic exile twice: once in the daytime and once at dusk. The daytime event is public, meant to be seen but not fully understood. The dusk event is more secretive, akin to Jesus' statement in the Book of John:

**John 11:9-10 (NIV)**
> "Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.'"

Jesus' public teachings and miracles were like Ezekiel's daytime enactment—visible but not fully understood. The events at dusk, his supposed crucifixion and the disciples' abandonment, were the hidden aspects that would only be fully revealed later.

### Ezekiel 12:7-12
**Verses:**
> "So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched."

#### Commentary:
Ezekiel follows the command, enacting the prophecy in both daytime and dusk. The staff or subjects watch him but do not intervene or follow, much like the disciples who abandoned Jesus on the night of his supposed crucifixion.

### Ezekiel 12:13-16
**Verses:**
> "I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with a drawn sword."

#### Commentary:
The prince's staff and troops are scattered, aligning with Jesus' prediction that his disciples would scatter and abandon him. This scattering is a crucial part of the unfolding events, allowing the prince (or Jesus, in this interpretation) to fulfill his role.

By examining Ezekiel 12 line by line, we can see a compelling parallel with the events surrounding Jesus. The dual enactments in Ezekiel—daytime and dusk—mirror the public and hidden aspects of Jesus' ministry and the events leading to the supposed crucifixion. The abandonment by the staff or subjects in Ezekiel also finds a parallel in the disciples forsaking Jesus, adding another layer to this intricate tapestry of symbolism and prophecy.

Walking at night and stumbling refers to people, not being aware of, or able to see the stumbling block that has been placed before them. This refers to the deception that occurred after the crucifixion by the church and Peter, who ran away from the crucifixion instead of being the sacrificial offering for the sins of the priesthood outside of the court or the temple. Draw on Leviticus, 16. There are two goats and a ram. Jesus in Judas are the two goats and Peter is the ram offering for the priesthood. Since Peter ran away from the ceremony the priesthood remains uncleansed. Thus the deceptions and stumbling blocks of Israel. Ezekiel 13 goes on to describe false like profit of Israel who comes. This is Paul. Thus because of people not understanding what happened with the atonement ritual they will stumble and go into captivity as we see in the world history.

---

Certainly, let's integrate these elements into the interpretation, drawing from Leviticus 16, which describes the Yom Kippur atonement ritual involving two goats and a ram.

### Leviticus 16: The Atonement Ritual
**Verses:**
> "Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the Lord and sacrifice it for a sin offering. But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat."

#### Commentary:
In the Yom Kippur ritual, one goat is sacrificed as a sin offering, while the other is sent into the wilderness as a scapegoat to carry away the sins of the people. A ram is also offered as a burnt offering for the priests.

### Jesus, Judas, and Peter: The Atonement Figures
In this interpretation, Jesus and Judas are the two goats. Judas is the goat sacrificed for sin, while Jesus is the scapegoat sent away, fulfilling the role described in Ezekiel 12. Peter, who was supposed to be the ram offering for the priesthood, fails in his role by fleeing, leaving the priesthood uncleansed.

### The Stumbling Block: Deception and Misunderstanding
**John 11:9-10 (NIV)**
> "Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.'"

#### Commentary:
The "stumbling at night" can be interpreted as the deception and misunderstanding that followed the crucifixion, particularly by the early church and Peter. Because the true nature of the atonement ritual was not understood, a stumbling block was placed before the people, leading to spiritual captivity and deception.

### Ezekiel 13: The False Prophet
**Verses:**
> "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: 'Hear the word of the Lord!'"

#### Commentary:
Ezekiel 13 warns against false prophets in Israel. In this interpretation, Paul is identified as the false prophet who leads people astray, further contributing to the stumbling block and captivity of Israel.

### The Consequence: Captivity and Deception
Because the true nature of the atonement was not understood—due to Peter's failure and the subsequent teachings of Paul and the early church—Israel and, by extension, the world have been led into spiritual captivity.

By tying these elements together, we get a comprehensive view that challenges traditional interpretations. It suggests that the failure to understand the true nature of the atonement ritual has had far-reaching implications, leading to spiritual deception and captivity.

Explain this all again in full detail. Include all of the elements and quotes so that I can get the full picture. We can do this in chunks if we need to, but I want it to be thorough take my entire argument and your responses and organize them into Logical and sequential space so that we can understand the entirety, including all of the different aspects of the chapters and verses that we’ve covered. Do not use softening phrases like in this interpretation because they really weaken the argument. It’s better to say in this case. This is not an alternative explanation or anything like that. That also makes it sound week. This is an analysis.

---

Certainly, let's construct a comprehensive and logically sequenced analysis that integrates all the elements we've discussed. We'll delve into the biblical chapters and verses, drawing upon Ezekiel 12, Leviticus 16, and the Gospel of John, to present a cohesive understanding of the events surrounding Jesus, Judas, and Peter.

### Introduction: The Atonement Ritual and Its Players
The Yom Kippur atonement ritual described in Leviticus 16 involves two goats and a ram. One goat is sacrificed as a sin offering, while the other is sent into the wilderness as a scapegoat to carry away the sins of the people. A ram is also offered as a burnt offering for the priesthood. In this case, Jesus and Judas serve as the two goats, and Peter is the ram intended for the priesthood.

### Leviticus 16: The Framework for Atonement
**Verses:**
> "Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the Lord and sacrifice it for a sin offering. But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat."

#### Commentary:
Judas is the goat sacrificed for sin, fulfilling the role of the sin offering. Jesus, on the other hand, is the scapegoat who is sent away, aligning with the prophecy in Ezekiel 12. Peter, who was supposed to serve as the ram offering for the priesthood, fails in his role by fleeing, leaving the priesthood uncleansed.

### Ezekiel 12: The Prophecy of the Prince and the Dual Events
Ezekiel 12 describes a prince who enacts a symbolic exile twice: once in the daytime and once at dusk. The daytime event is public but not fully understood, while the dusk event is more secretive.

**Verses:**
> "Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile."

#### Commentary:
Jesus' public teachings and miracles are akin to Ezekiel's daytime enactment—visible but not fully understood. The events at dusk, his supposed crucifixion and the disciples' abandonment, are the hidden aspects that would only be fully revealed later.

### The Stumbling Block: Deception and Misunderstanding
**John 11:9-10 (NIV)**
> "Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.'"

#### Commentary:
The "stumbling at night" refers to the deception and misunderstanding that followed the crucifixion, particularly by the early church and Peter. Because the true nature of the atonement ritual was not understood, a stumbling block was placed before the people, leading to spiritual captivity and deception.

### Ezekiel 13: The False Prophet
**Verses:**
> "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: 'Hear the word of the Lord!'"

#### Commentary:
Paul is identified as the false prophet who leads people astray, further contributing to the stumbling block and captivity of Israel.

### The Consequence: Captivity and Deception
Because the true nature of the atonement was not understood—due to Peter's failure and the subsequent teachings of Paul and the early church—Israel and, by extension, the world have been led into spiritual captivity.

This analysis presents a cohesive understanding of the events surrounding Jesus, Judas, and Peter, drawing upon Leviticus 16, Ezekiel 12, and the Gospel of John. It suggests that the failure to understand the true nature of the atonement ritual has had far-reaching implications, leading to spiritual deception and captivity.

This seems pretty accurate, except we need to modify the parts of the analysis of Ezekiel‘s acts in the daylight, and at dusk, comparing them with Jesus is statements about what happens in the daylight, and what happens at night. Both are speaking about things that are understood, and things that are not understood. But Ezekiel referring to, the first captivity that will be understood as the prophesy prophecy be about Zedekiah. The part he says perhaps they will understand it although they are rebellious refers to the going out at dusk, which is the part that people will not understand because they’ll think that this prophecy was about Zedekiah. This is the hidden part that Jesus refers to about what happens  at night. This rebelliousness that causes them to not understand is the same stumbling block that Jesus talks about. Integrate this into the analysis and reiterate it

---

Certainly, let's refine the analysis by focusing on the dual aspects of Ezekiel's prophecy and Jesus' statements about daytime and nighttime events. Both Ezekiel and Jesus speak to things that are understood (daytime) and things that are not understood (dusk/nighttime). The key is the "rebelliousness" that prevents understanding, serving as the stumbling block.

### Ezekiel 12: Daylight and Dusk - The Dual Prophecies
Ezekiel 12 describes a prince who performs a symbolic exile twice: once in the daytime and once at dusk. The daytime event is public and initially understood to be a prophecy about Zedekiah. 

**Verses:**
> "Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile."

#### Commentary:
The daytime enactment is understood by the people as a prophecy about Zedekiah. However, the dusk enactment is the hidden aspect, the one that Ezekiel hints "perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people." This is the part that people fail to grasp because they assume the prophecy was solely about Zedekiah. 

### Jesus' Statements: Daylight and Nighttime
**John 11:9-10 (NIV)**
> "Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.'"

#### Commentary:
Jesus' public teachings and miracles are the "daytime" events—visible and understood to some extent. However, the "nighttime" events, specifically the supposed crucifixion and the disciples' abandonment, are the hidden aspects that people fail to understand. This lack of understanding serves as the stumbling block Jesus refers to.

### The Stumbling Block: Rebelliousness and Lack of Understanding
The "rebelliousness" that Ezekiel refers to is the same stumbling block that Jesus talks about. It's the inability or unwillingness to understand the deeper, hidden meanings behind the events. This rebelliousness leads to a lack of understanding of the true nature of the atonement ritual, thereby causing spiritual deception and captivity.

### Integration and Summary
In this analysis, the dual enactments in Ezekiel 12—daytime and dusk—mirror the public and hidden aspects of Jesus' ministry and the events leading to the supposed crucifixion. The daytime events are understood, but it's the events at dusk or nighttime that are the hidden aspects, clouded by rebelliousness and leading to a stumbling block. This stumbling block, as Jesus points out, results in spiritual captivity and deception, further exacerbated by the teachings of Paul, the false prophet in Ezekiel 13.

By integrating these elements, the analysis presents a cohesive understanding that the failure to grasp the true nature of the atonement ritual has led to far-reaching spiritual deception and captivity.
