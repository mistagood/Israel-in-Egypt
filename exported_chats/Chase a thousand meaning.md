# Chase a thousand meaning



---



---

One of you will chase a thousand 

---



---

That phrase comes from several places in the Hebrew Bible, most notably:  

**Deuteronomy 32:30**  
> *"How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had given them up?"* (ESV)  
**Hebrew:**  
> אֵיכָה יִרְדֹּף אֶחָד אֶלֶף וּשְׁנַיִם יָנִיסוּ רְבָבָה אִם־לֹא כִּי־צוּרָם מְכָרָם וַיהוָה הִסְגִּירָם׃  

---

**Joshua 23:10**  
> *"One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you."* (NKJV)  
**Hebrew:**  
> אִישׁ־אֶחָד מִכֶּם יִרְדֹּף אֶלֶף כִּי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם הוּא הַנִּלְחָם לָכֶם כַּאֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר לָכֶם׃

**Hebrew word study**  
- **יִרְדֹּף** (*yirdof*) — from the root **רדף** (*radaph*), meaning *to pursue, chase, put to flight*.  
- **אֶלֶף** (*eleph*) — literally *a thousand*, but also used figuratively for a great multitude.  
- The imagery is military: one faithful warrior empowered by God can rout a vastly superior force. The same applies exponentially when more are in covenant alignment with God.

If you want, I can give you the **full context** in both Joshua 23 and Deuteronomy 32 so you can see how this statement is tied to covenant obedience. That’s where the real force of the promise comes in.

Context 

---

Here’s the **full context** for the “one of you will chase a thousand” phrase from both passages where it appears, so you can see how it’s framed in covenant terms.  

---

## **Joshua 23:6–13** (NKJV)  
> **6** Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, lest you turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,  
> **7** and lest you go among these nations, these who remain among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause anyone to swear by them; you shall not serve them nor bow down to them,  
> **8** but you shall hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.  
> **9** For the LORD has driven out from before you great and strong nations; but as for you, no one has been able to stand against you to this day.  
> **10** *One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, as He promised you.*  
> **11** Therefore take careful heed to yourselves, that you love the LORD your God.  
> **12** Or else, if indeed you do go back, and cling to the remnant of these nations—these that remain among you—and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you,  
> **13** know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations from before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which the LORD your God has given you.

**Key point:** The promise (“one will chase a thousand”) is tied directly to obedience, love for God, and separation from idolatry.

## **Deuteronomy 32:28–31** (Song of Moses, NKJV)  
> **28** For they are a nation void of counsel, nor is there any understanding in them.  
> **29** Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!  
> **30** *How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had surrendered them?*  
> **31** For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.

**Key point:** Here, the phrase is used *negatively* — describing how it is only possible for so few to rout so many if God has *given them over* to defeat. It’s a reversal of the promise in Joshua 23.

### **Hebrew Connections**
- In **Joshua 23:10**, *יִרְדֹּף אֶחָד אֶלֶף* (yirdof echad eleph) — “one will chase a thousand” — expresses victory by God’s power on Israel’s side.  
- In **Deuteronomy 32:30**, the same root (*radaph*, pursue) is used, but in a lament, showing defeat because God is no longer defending them.  

This is a deliberate **covenant contrast**:  
- **Obedience** → God fights for you → one can chase a thousand.  
- **Rebellion** → God withdraws help → one enemy can chase a thousand of you.

If you want, I can chart this out as a **side-by-side covenant blessing vs. curse table**, showing exactly how the “one chasing a thousand” flips meaning depending on Israel’s faithfulness. That’s how the biblical authors structured it.
