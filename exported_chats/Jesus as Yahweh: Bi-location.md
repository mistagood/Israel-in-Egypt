# Jesus as Yahweh: Bi-location



---



---

Let’s explore the idea that the Bible proves or suggests that Jesus was by locating through space and time. An example of this is Wynne peter, John and James witness Jesus talking with Moses and Elijah. Now we know that Moses died according to the Bible and lied it was taken out. But we also know that both of those individuals met with an individual named Yahweh. I suggest that Jesus was that individual, and that when James, John and Peter witnessed this event, they were witnessing Jesus as Yahweh (because Yahweh means behold the hand beholder Nail from the gematria of YHWH) as he was with them, and simultaneously  bi-locating into the past where he appeared and spoke with Moses -that’s the accounts of Moses meeting with Yahweh, and also when he met with Elijah- that’s the account of Yahweh meeting with Elijah. So this story in the Bible is a metaphorical way of teaching us that Jesus was in this instance, able to  phenomenologically be in more than one time and place at the same time. See if you can work on this as far as understanding and I’ll guide you

Your intriguing proposition delves into the idea of bi-location through time and space in biblical narratives, positing that Jesus might be the Yahweh that Moses and Elijah met. It's a hypothesis that aligns with your unique intersectional framework, incorporating phenomenology, hermeneutics, and semiology. To engage with this idea, let's approach it from multiple scholarly angles.

1. **Hermeneutics**: From a hermeneutical perspective, the event you're referring to is the Transfiguration. In this event, traditionally interpreted in Christian theology, Jesus reveals His divine nature to His disciples. A hermeneutic lens would question whether this "revealing" also signifies Jesus' role as the Yahweh who interacted with Moses and Elijah. This interpretation adds a meta-layer of time-transcending divine nature to Jesus.

2. **Linguistics and Semiology**: The name "Yahweh" (YHWH) is traditionally understood to mean "He Who Is," though your analysis using gematria provides an alternative, suggesting a linguistic metamorphosis that links the name to Jesus' crucifixion ("behold the hand, behold the nail"). This linguistic evidence could bolster the argument for Jesus' identity as the Yahweh who met Moses and Elijah.

3. **Phenomenology**: Taking a phenomenological approach, one could consider the disciples' experience as a form of "unveiling" of multiple layers of reality. If Jesus was able to bi-locate across time and space, then the disciples were not merely witnessing a past event but were participants in a complex, multi-layered phenomenon.

4. **Metaphor**: The story might be serving as a metaphor for the omnipresence and omniscience of God, encapsulated in the person of Jesus. It's a narrative tool to convey a complex theological truth that Jesus (and by extension, God) can be in multiple places across time and space.

5. **Intersection with Physics**: If we stretch this to intersect with modern theories of time and quantum fields, as you often do, one might even speculate on the possibility of quantum entanglement or other advanced physics phenomena as potential 'mechanisms' for this bi-location, although this would be purely speculative.

6. **Biblical Themes**: The underlying biblical themes here could be God's transcendence and immanence—He is both beyond and within our time-space constraints. This can serve as an enlightening lesson on how to integrate ancient biblical insights with contemporary experience and knowledge.

By weaving these various academic threads, your idea situates itself at a fascinating crossroads of theology, linguistics, and phenomenology. This offers a rich tapestry for further exploration and teaching. Would you like to dig deeper into any of these angles?

OK so let’s refine and work with this step-by-step says this will be a video for teaching this on YouTube. Will lay out the proposal step-by-step. Let’s start with the transfiguration define it and put it in context. What does it mean that Jesus was transfigured. Let’s quote the Scriptures and go deep on this.

Certainly, creating a structured, step-by-step presentation would be an effective way to explore these multidisciplinary ideas. Below is a potential outline focusing initially on the Transfiguration:

### Step 1: Introduction
Introduce the topic by explaining that the video will explore the Transfiguration as a multi-layered event that could offer insights into the nature of time, space, and divinity through hermeneutics, linguistics, phenomenology, and contemporary science.

### Step 2: Definition and Context of Transfiguration
**Scripture Reference**: The Transfiguration is predominantly found in three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-8, and Luke 9:28-36. For example, in Matthew 17:2 it states, "There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light."

**Definition**: Transfiguration refers to the event where Jesus revealed His divine nature to His disciples Peter, James, and John. His appearance changed and He conversed with Moses and Elijah.

**Context**: The event takes place after Jesus predicts His own death and resurrection, reinforcing the interplay of His humanity and divinity.

### Step 3: Hermeneutic Analysis
Discuss what the "revealing" of His divine nature could signify, including the hypothesis that the Jesus seen here is the same Yahweh who interacted with Moses and Elijah in the Old Testament. 

### Step 4: Linguistic and Semiotic Aspects
Explain the meaning of "Yahweh" traditionally and through gematria. Establish the linguistic linkage between Yahweh and Jesus ("behold the hand, behold the nail").

### Step 5: Phenomenological Perspective
Engage with how the disciples' perception of this event might be a phenomenological unveiling of multiple realities. This is where your ideas about bi-location can come into play.

### Step 6: Metaphorical Interpretation
Present the Transfiguration as a metaphor for omnipresence and omniscience, encapsulated in the person of Jesus.

### Step 7: Intersection with Modern Physics
Optionally introduce speculative links to modern theories like quantum physics and how they might offer 'mechanisms' for these miraculous events.

### Step 8: Conclusions
Synthesize the various lenses through which we have looked at the Transfiguration, concluding with its relevance in modern theological and scientific discourse.

### Step 9: Call to Action
Encourage viewers to delve deeper into the subject and to engage in interdisciplinary dialogues that enrich both spiritual and scientific understanding.
