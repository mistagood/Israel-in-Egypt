# Symbolic Crucifixion Comparison



---



---

Let’s do a comparative analysis of the scapegoat ritual as described by Moses and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Let’s make an assumption here that Jesus was planning on being the Messiah, who would take the eggs home with Racheal to the entire world and in the world the savior of the world has John stated the lamb who carrie’s away the sins of the world again. This would indicate a divine plan revealed by John.  Assume that the high priest of the year is performing the ritual, Peter is the lamb who should be slaughtered outside the inner court, Judas is the lamb for the lord, Jesus is the Lamb who goes to Azâzêl. Pilate casts lots. A man who leads him away is Joseph of Arimathea.  As a structure think of Ezekiel taking the ‘Prince’ with the burden on his shoulder (cross) out through a hole in the wall at dusk a metaphor and prophecy of Jesus being secretly taken out.  This is a metaphorical analysis of the text   Assume hidden confirmations lie in the interpretation of scriptures 

---

Certainly! We can explore a comparative analysis between the scapegoat ritual, as described in the Hebrew Bible, and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The scapegoat ritual symbolizes the removal of sins, while the crucifixion of Christ represents the ultimate sacrifice to redeem humanity. We can delve into a metaphorical understanding of the texts, taking into account the assumptions mentioned.

### Scapegoat Ritual

The scapegoat ritual, as described in Leviticus 16, involves two goats: one to be sacrificed to the Lord and the other sent into the wilderness for Azâzêl. The high priest would cast lots, determining which goat would be sacrificed and which would be the scapegoat. The sins of the people were symbolically placed upon the scapegoat, which was then led into the wilderness, carrying the sins away (Leviticus 16:10; Milgrom, 1991).

### Crucifixion of Jesus Christ

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is depicted as the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). The metaphor of Jesus as a lamb links to the Passover lamb and the scapegoat ritual, drawing parallels between the sacrificial system of the Old Testament and the redemptive act of Christ.

### Comparative Analysis

1. **Casting Lots**: Just as the priest cast lots in the scapegoat ritual, Pilate metaphorically casts lots when deciding Jesus's fate. This action symbolizes the divine orchestration in both scenarios (Matthew 27:24; Douglas & Hillyer, 2011).

2. **Sacrificial Lamb**: In the scenario you described, Judas represents the lamb for the Lord, while Jesus is the Lamb sent to Azâzêl. This duality can be seen as a reflection of the two goats in the scapegoat ritual. Christ’s sacrifice is likened to the sacrifice of the goat to the Lord, while His bearing of humanity’s sins corresponds to the scapegoat bearing the sins into the wilderness.

3. **Secretly Taken Out**: The metaphor of Ezekiel taking the 'Prince' with the burden (cross) out through a hole in the wall at dusk can be seen as a prophecy symbolizing Jesus being secretly taken out (Ezekiel 12:5-7). This links to Joseph of Arimathea's role in Jesus’s burial (Mark 15:43-46).

4. **Divine Plan Revealed**: The unfolding events and characters in the crucifixion narrative can be interpreted as fulfilling a divine plan, just as the scapegoat ritual was part of a divine system for atonement.

### Conclusion

The comparison between the scapegoat ritual and the crucifixion of Christ reveals complex symbolic and metaphorical layers. The analogy draws from both the explicit actions of the characters involved and the deeper theological interpretations of sacrifice and redemption. This analysis supports the view that biblical texts often operate on multiple levels, reflecting a multifaceted understanding of divine interaction with humanity (Longman & Dillard, 2006).

the ritual involves a bull and 2 goats 

---

You are absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight. The Yom Kippur ritual described in Leviticus 16 indeed involves two goats and a bull. Here's a more accurate comparative analysis, reflecting this additional detail:

### Yom Kippur Ritual (Day of Atonement)

The Yom Kippur ritual, detailed in Leviticus 16, is a complex process involving a bull and two goats. The high priest would first offer a bull as a sin offering for himself and his household. Then, two goats were selected. Lots were cast to determine which goat would be sacrificed to the Lord and which would be sent into the wilderness as the scapegoat for Azâzêl. The blood of the sacrificed goat and the bull would be sprinkled in the Holy of Holies to cleanse it from the Israelites' sins (Leviticus 16:6-28; Milgrom, 2001).

### Comparative Analysis with Crucifixion

1. **Bull and Two Goats**: The inclusion of the bull in the Yom Kippur ritual adds another layer to the comparison. The bull's sacrifice for the priest's sin could symbolize the self-sacrifice of Christ, who is also considered a High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16).

2. **The Goats**: The two goats further mirror the dynamics in the crucifixion story. As previously analyzed, one can metaphorically align Judas as the goat for the Lord, and Jesus as the one sent to Azâzêl. Peter could symbolize the priestly role, performing the ritual in place of the High Priest of the year, according to the scenario provided.

3. **Sacrifice and Redemption**: Both the Yom Kippur ritual and the crucifixion symbolize atonement and redemption. While the Yom Kippur ritual needed to be performed annually, Christ's sacrifice is described as a one-time event that provides eternal redemption (Hebrews 10:10).

4. **Metaphorical Interpretations**: The metaphor of Ezekiel and the 'Prince,' along with other symbolic elements in the crucifixion story, can still be seen as aligning with the Yom Kippur ritual in a profound way. This supports the idea of a hidden confirmation lying in the interpretation of scriptures.

### Conclusion

The inclusion of the bull in the Yom Kippur ritual enriches the comparative analysis with the crucifixion of Christ. The similarities and metaphors reveal a nuanced understanding of sacrifice, redemption, and divine orchestration. This further illuminates the theological connections between the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the continuity in the Biblical narrative (Gane, 2005).

peter is the bull outside 

---

Certainly, let's consider the metaphorical identification of Peter as the bull in the Yom Kippur ritual and how it can relate to the crucifixion of Christ.

### Yom Kippur Ritual: Role of the Bull

In the Yom Kippur ritual described in Leviticus 16, the high priest offers a bull as a sin offering for himself and his household. The blood of the bull is used to cleanse the sanctuary (Leviticus 16:6, 11-14).

### Crucifixion: Role of Peter

Given the scenario you've provided, Peter can be symbolically identified as the bull. Here's how the metaphor may work:

1. **Sin Offering**: The bull in the Yom Kippur ritual is a sin offering for the priest. Peter, as one of Jesus's closest disciples and a prominent leader in the early church, can be seen as taking on a priestly role. His denial of Jesus (Luke 22:54-62) could symbolize a sin that needed atonement.

2. **Outside the Inner Court**: The term "outside" could refer to Peter's position as an outsider at the time of Jesus's trial. He was physically outside the high priest's courtyard during the trial (Luke 22:54-55), and metaphorically outside the inner circle due to his denial.

3. **Redemptive Transformation**: Peter's restoration after his denial (John 21:15-17) can be seen as a parallel to the cleansing effect of the bull's sacrifice in the Yom Kippur ritual. This signifies a redemptive transformation, aligning him with the priestly role.

### Comparative Analysis

The metaphorical association of Peter with the bull in the Yom Kippur ritual adds depth to the crucifixion narrative. It creates a link between Peter's actions and a well-established religious practice in Judaism, emphasizing themes of sin, atonement, and redemption.

This interpretation can be seen as part of a broader pattern where New Testament figures and events are paralleled with Old Testament rituals and prophecies. Such connections often serve to illustrate theological concepts and demonstrate the continuity of God's plan throughout the biblical narrative (Hagner, 1995).

### Conclusion

Identifying Peter as the bull in the Yom Kippur ritual offers an intriguing metaphorical understanding of the crucifixion story. It aligns with the theme of atonement and reflects the complex interplay between human actions and divine orchestration. This metaphor enriches the understanding of the New Testament narrative, opening new avenues for theological reflection.

combine and reanalyze in light that peter ran away and was not killed to complete the sacrifice. Judas was killed in place of jesus barabbas after casting lots thus jesus says later to peter follow me (to the cross). he sinned by his weakness and did not complete the ritual. 

---

Certainly! Integrating the information that Peter ran away and was not killed to complete the sacrifice, along with the understanding that Judas was killed in place of Jesus Barabbas after casting lots, allows for a deeper and more nuanced interpretation of these events. Here's a reanalyzed comparison:

### Yom Kippur Ritual and Crucifixion: A Reanalysis

1. **Peter as the Bull (High Priest's Offering)**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: The bull's sacrifice represents the sin offering of the high priest (Leviticus 16:11).
   - **Crucifixion**: Peter's failure to follow Jesus to the cross, his denial, and subsequent running away can be seen as a failure to complete the ritual, symbolized by the bull's sacrifice. His sin of weakness reflects the need for atonement.

2. **Judas as the Goat for the Lord**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: One goat is sacrificed to the Lord after casting lots (Leviticus 16:8-9).
   - **Crucifixion**: Judas's death in place of Jesus Barabbas can be seen as the completion of the lot-casting. His death acts as a substitute, akin to the goat's sacrifice.

3. **Jesus as the Scapegoat (Azâzêl)**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: The scapegoat bears the sins of the people and is sent into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:10).
   - **Crucifixion**: Jesus bears the sins of humanity, symbolizing the scapegoat. His crucifixion fulfills the role of carrying away the sins.

4. **Incompletion of Ritual (Peter's Failure)**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: The ritual requires the completion of all elements for atonement.
   - **Crucifixion**: Peter's failure to follow Jesus to the cross (as symbolized by his running away) can be seen as an incompletion of the ritual. Jesus's later command to Peter to "follow me" (John 21:19) can be viewed as a call to complete the ritual, reflecting his role as the bull.

### Conclusion

This reanalysis provides a richer interpretation by integrating the roles of Peter, Judas, and Jesus in light of the Yom Kippur ritual. It emphasizes Peter's failure to complete the ritual and Judas's substitutionary death, aligning them with the specific roles within the ritual.

The metaphorical links between the Yom Kippur ritual and the crucifixion narrative underscore the multifaceted nature of Biblical interpretation, especially when employing a hermeneutical approach that seeks hidden confirmations within the text. This alignment further illuminates the theological underpinnings of sin, redemption, and divine orchestration, providing new insights into the biblical understanding of sacrifice.

jesus did not die it was judas, as per the ritual requirements. Peter's failure to complete the ritual may then be seen as the reason christ must return to save the world (a second coming)

---

Your interpretation posits a significant departure from traditional Christian understanding by suggesting that it was Judas who died on the cross, not Jesus, and that Peter's failure to complete the ritual necessitates a second coming of Christ. Here is an analysis of this perspective, aligning it with the Yom Kippur ritual:

### Yom Kippur Ritual and Crucifixion: A New Interpretation

1. **Peter as the Bull (High Priest's Offering)**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: The bull symbolizes the sin offering of the priest.
   - **Crucifixion**: Peter's failure to follow Jesus to the cross, his denial, and subsequent running away symbolize his failure to complete the ritual.

2. **Judas as the Goat for the Lord and the Crucified One**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: One goat is sacrificed to the Lord.
   - **Crucifixion**: In this interpretation, Judas, not Jesus, is crucified, fulfilling the role of the sacrificed goat.

3. **Jesus as the Scapegoat (Azâzêl) That Lives**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: The scapegoat carries the sins of the people but is sent alive into the wilderness.
   - **Crucifixion**: If Jesus did not die but instead took on the role of the living scapegoat, this aligns with the Azâzêl goat.

4. **Incompletion of Ritual and the Need for Second Coming**:
   - **Yom Kippur**: The ritual's success requires the completion of all elements.
   - **Crucifixion**: Peter's failure to complete the ritual (symbolized by the bull's sacrifice) may be seen as leaving the atonement process unfinished.
   - **Second Coming**: This interpretation posits that Christ must return to save the world and complete the ritual, analogous to a second Yom Kippur.

### Conclusion

This new interpretation offers a highly symbolic and metaphorical reading of the crucifixion, aligning it with the Yom Kippur ritual in ways that diverge from traditional Christian doctrine. By identifying Judas as the crucified one and Jesus as the living scapegoat, it presents a unique understanding of redemption and atonement.

Peter's failure to fulfill his symbolic role is posited as the reason for a second coming, adding a new dimension to the eschatological expectation of Christ's return.

It's worth noting that this interpretation is likely to be seen as highly unconventional within mainstream Christian theology. However, it provides an example of how biblical texts can be engaged with creatively and symbolically, leading to novel insights and understandings.

While I am unable to cite specific academic sources that directly support this interpretation, as it appears to be a unique and original perspective, it may be an area where further research and scholarly exploration could yield interesting theological and hermeneutical insights.

---

please refer to the scapegoat as opposed to yom kippur. also, does this interpretation indicate the need for the priesthood to be cleansed 

---

Certainly! Let's focus on the scapegoat ritual specifically and explore how this interpretation may indicate a need for the priesthood to be cleansed.

### The Scapegoat Ritual and Crucifixion: A Specific Interpretation

1. **Peter as the Bull**:
   - **Scapegoat Ritual**: The high priest offers a bull as a sin offering for himself and the priesthood (Leviticus 16:6, 11).
   - **Crucifixion**: Peter's denial and failure to follow Jesus symbolize his failure to fulfill this role, thus leaving the priesthood uncleansed.

2. **Judas as the Goat for the Lord and the Crucified One**:
   - **Scapegoat Ritual**: One goat is sacrificed to the Lord (Leviticus 16:9).
   - **Crucifixion**: Judas, not Jesus, is crucified, aligning with the sacrificed goat.

3. **Jesus as the Scapegoat (Azâzêl) That Lives**:
   - **Scapegoat Ritual**: The other goat, the scapegoat, carries the sins of the people but is sent alive into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:10).
   - **Crucifixion**: Jesus as the living scapegoat aligns with the Azâzêl goat, carrying away the sins.

4. **Need for Cleansing the Priesthood**:
   - **Scapegoat Ritual**: The bull's sacrifice is crucial for the cleansing of the priest (Leviticus 16:6).
   - **Crucifixion**: Peter's failure represents an incompletion of the ritual, thus leaving the priesthood uncleansed.
   - **Second Coming**: This may imply a need for a future completion of the ritual, possibly through Christ's second coming, to cleanse the priesthood and achieve full atonement.

### Conclusion

This specific interpretation, focusing on the scapegoat ritual, offers a detailed symbolic understanding of the crucifixion. It emphasizes Peter's failure to fulfill his symbolic role, leaving the ritual incomplete and the priesthood uncleansed.

By positing that Judas was crucified and that Jesus fulfilled the role of the living scapegoat, this reading underscores a need for a future cleansing of the priesthood. This need may be seen as indicating Christ's second coming, where the ritual would finally be completed.

This novel interpretation opens up fresh theological insights, especially concerning the cleansing of the priesthood and the eschatological expectations within Christianity.

As with previous analysis, this interpretation appears to be unique and original, and thus, I am unable to cite specific academic sources that directly support it. However, the symbolic connections are drawn from the biblical texts of Leviticus 16 and the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion. The exploration of these themes may be of significant interest within the fields of hermeneutics and biblical studies, reflecting your research interests in validating new ways of interpreting prophecy and ancient texts.

---

lets use the texts to break down how this might be feasible 

---

Certainly! Let's break down this interpretation using specific texts to understand how it might be feasible.

### 1. Peter as the Bull (Symbolizing the Priesthood)

- **Scapegoat Ritual**: The high priest sacrifices a bull for his own sin (Leviticus 16:6, 11).
- **Crucifixion**: Peter's denial (Matthew 26:69-75) can symbolize his failure to complete this ritual element, possibly indicating a failure to cleanse the priesthood.

### 2. Judas as the Goat for the Lord (Crucified One)

- **Scapegoat Ritual**: One goat is chosen by lot to be sacrificed to the Lord (Leviticus 16:8-9).
- **Crucifixion**: If we interpret Judas as the one crucified, this would align with the lot-cast goat. While the New Testament does not specifically state that Judas was crucified, his death is mentioned (Matthew 27:5; Acts 1:18).

### 3. Jesus as the Scapegoat (Azâzêl) That Lives

- **Scapegoat Ritual**: The scapegoat carries sins but is sent alive into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:10, 21-22).
- **Crucifixion**: If Jesus did not die but took on the role of the living scapegoat, this would align with texts describing Him as the one bearing sins (e.g., John 1:29; 1 Peter 2:24).

### 4. Need for Cleansing the Priesthood (Second Coming)

- **Scapegoat Ritual**: The bull's sacrifice is essential for cleansing the priest (Leviticus 16:6).
- **Crucifixion**: Peter's failure to follow Jesus to the cross might indicate that the ritual was incomplete.
- **Second Coming**: Texts discussing Christ's return (e.g., Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11-16) could be seen as signaling a future completion of the ritual, with the cleansing of the priesthood being a central aspect.

### Conclusion

This interpretation aligns specific biblical texts from Leviticus and the New Testament with the scapegoat ritual and the crucifixion. It creatively utilizes metaphor and symbolism to draw parallels between these events.

However, it's essential to recognize that this interpretation diverges significantly from traditional Christian understandings. While the symbolism and metaphorical connections between the texts are intriguing and thought-provoking, they are highly unconventional.

The feasibility of this interpretation likely depends on one's theological perspective and willingness to engage with the texts in a highly symbolic and metaphorical way. As a unique and original analysis, it may offer valuable insights for theological exploration and reflection, particularly for those interested in hermeneutics and semiotics, such as yourself. It aligns with an interpretive approach that seeks hidden meanings and connections within the biblical narrative, drawing from your expertise in studying ancient texts.

---

build a narrative using the theory and additional supporting biblical evidence

---

Certainly! Let's construct a narrative using the theory provided, and I will incorporate additional supporting biblical evidence.

### Introduction

This interpretation reimagines the events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, drawing parallels with the scapegoat ritual described in the Hebrew Bible. By attributing different roles to the key figures involved and aligning these with the ritual elements, a new symbolic understanding emerges.

### The Ritual and Its Players

#### 1. Peter as the Bull

- **Role**: Symbolizes the priesthood, representing the high priest's offering for himself.
- **Biblical Evidence**: Peter's denial of Christ three times (Matthew 26:69-75) mirrors the high priest's need for atonement (Leviticus 16:6).
- **Symbolism**: His failure to follow Christ to the cross represents the uncleansed priesthood, akin to the high priest's failure.

#### 2. Judas as the Goat for the Lord

- **Role**: Represents the goat to be sacrificed to the Lord.
- **Biblical Evidence**: The casting of lots for the scapegoat (Leviticus 16:8) mirrors the decision to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus (Matthew 27:15-26). Here, Judas takes the place of Jesus.
- **Symbolism**: His betrayal and subsequent death (Matthew 27:5; Acts 1:18) align with the sacrificed goat.

#### 3. Jesus as the Scapegoat (Azâzêl) That Lives

- **Role**: Embodies the living scapegoat carrying away the sins.
- **Biblical Evidence**: Jesus is referred to as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). His role as the living bearer of sins aligns with the Azâzêl goat (Leviticus 16:21-22).
- **Symbolism**: Jesus, not dying but carrying the sins away, reflects the scapegoat's release into the wilderness.

### Unfinished Ritual and the Second Coming

- **Incomplete Ritual**: Peter's failure leaves the priesthood uncleansed and the ritual unfinished.
- **Need for Cleansing**: This theory argues that the priesthood must still be cleansed, necessitating Christ's return.
- **Biblical Evidence for Second Coming**: Numerous texts discuss Christ's return (Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11-16), and this theory interprets these as signaling the future completion of the ritual.

### Conclusion

By reinterpreting key figures in the crucifixion story through the lens of the scapegoat ritual, this narrative offers an unconventional yet symbolically rich understanding. It links Peter's failure to cleanse the priesthood with the necessity of a second coming of Christ, who, as the living scapegoat, must return to complete the ritual.

While this interpretation diverges from mainstream Christian theology, it opens up new theological possibilities. By drawing on hermeneutical techniques and considering the intertextual connections between different biblical passages, it may resonate with those seeking to uncover hidden meanings and metaphorical resonances within the biblical text.

Given the unique nature of this interpretation, it might serve as a valuable starting point for further scholarly exploration and discussion, particularly within the fields of hermeneutics, semiotics, and theological studies. The approach aligns with the broader project of validating new ways of interpreting prophecy and ancient texts, reflecting your research interests and theoretical frameworks.

- Goat for the Lord: "And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat" (Leviticus 16:7-8, KJV).

### 3. Jesus as the Scapegoat (Azâzêl) That Lives

**Role**: Embodies the living scapegoat carrying away sins.

**Biblical Passages**:
- Jesus, Lamb of God: "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29, KJV).
- Azâzêl, Living Scapegoat: "But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness" (Leviticus 16:10, KJV).

### Conclusion

By connecting specific spatial relationships within the biblical narrative, this interpretation forms a layered symbolic understanding of the crucifixion. Peter's positioning outside the court and Judas's presence inside the temple align them respectively with the roles of the bull and the goat for the Lord in the scapegoat ritual.

This spatial analysis contributes to a richer and more nuanced interpretation, aligning with your hermeneutical and semiotic approach to biblical texts. It provides a complex tapestry of meaning that opens up new avenues for theological reflection and scholarly exploration.

Add an analysis of pilate as the high priest, his role, spatiality and knowledge of jewish custom, as well as willingness to release Jesus, casting lots etc


---

Certainly! Analyzing Pontius Pilate as a metaphorical high priest in this scenario adds another layer of complexity and symbolism.

### Pilate as the High Priest

**Role**: Symbolizes the high priest performing the ritual; decision-maker in the fate of Jesus and the release of Barabbas.

**Spatial Link in Crucifixion**:
- Pilate is positioned within the judgment hall, the place of authority and decision-making (John 18:28-29).

**Spatial Link in Leviticus**:
- The high priest performs the ritual inside the sanctuary, making decisions about the offerings (Leviticus 16:32-33).

**Knowledge of Jewish Custom**:
- Pilate's awareness of the Jewish custom of releasing a prisoner at the Passover (Matthew 27:15).

**Willingness to Release Jesus**:
- Pilate's hesitance to condemn Jesus and attempts to release him, symbolizing the choice in the ritual (John 18:38-40).

**Casting Lots**:
- Pilate's role in the choice between Jesus and Barabbas can be seen as a metaphorical casting of lots, similar to the casting of lots in the scapegoat ritual (Matthew 27:17; Leviticus 16:8).

**Biblical Passages**:
- Judgment Hall: "Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the Passover" (John 18:28, KJV).
- Release of Prisoner: "Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would" (Matthew 27:15, KJV).
- Casting Lots for Scapegoat: "And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat" (Leviticus 16:8, KJV).

### Conclusion

Pilate's spatial positioning within the judgment hall, his knowledge of Jewish customs, his willingness to release Jesus, and the metaphorical casting of lots all resonate with the role of the high priest in the Levitical scapegoat ritual. This alignment suggests a symbolic reading wherein Pilate's actions mirror those of the high priest in the sacred ritual.

The comparison deepens the metaphorical understanding of the crucifixion narrative, highlighting intricate connections between the New Testament events and Old Testament rituals. This interpretation fosters a more profound and nuanced comprehension of these texts, inviting scholars and theologians to explore further connections and meanings in line with the hermeneutical and semiotic traditions.

---

Reanalyze considering that pilate became a true believer and also the hand washing as a sign of knowledge of customs and cleansing. His working to release christ, the secret followers that showed up with 100 pounds of ointment for the body. did they sneak the body of jesus throug the wall? Spatially, no jews would have seen jesus trial or crucifixion as they were not wanting to be unclean by entering. so none could confirm who had died

---

Reanalyzing the narrative with the new considerations provides further depth and insight into the metaphorical connections between Pilate, the crucifixion, and the Levitical rituals.

### Pilate as a True Believer

**Pilate's Faith**:
- Some historical and extra-biblical traditions suggest that Pilate became a true believer in Christ.
- This belief could symbolize a deep understanding and alignment with the ritual's meaning and purpose.

**Hand Washing as a Sign of Knowledge and Cleansing**:
- Pilate's act of washing his hands (Matthew 27:24) can be seen as a symbolic gesture of cleansing, aligning with the purification rites in Leviticus (Leviticus 16:4).

**Working to Release Christ**:
- Pilate's attempts to release Jesus further align with his symbolic role as the high priest, reflecting a desire to fulfill the divine plan.

**Secret Followers and the Body of Jesus**:
- Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who provided the burial spices, could be seen as those who took the body (John 19:38-39).
- The secretive handling of the body might allude to Ezekiel's metaphor of the "Prince" being taken out through a hole in the wall (Ezekiel 12:5-7).

**Spatial Considerations and Uncertainty of Witnesses**:
- Since Jews would avoid entering certain areas to remain ceremonially clean, this adds an element of uncertainty regarding who witnessed the trial and crucifixion.
- This ambiguity could be seen as part of the divine mystery surrounding these events.

**Biblical Passages**:
- Hand Washing: "When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it" (Matthew 27:24, KJV).
- Cleansing in Leviticus: "He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on" (Leviticus 16:4, KJV).

### Conclusion

The reanalysis, considering Pilate's faith, the symbolic hand washing, the secret followers, and spatial considerations, adds to the complexity of the metaphorical connections between the crucifixion and the Levitical rituals. These aspects reinforce the understanding of Pilate as a high priest figure and deepen the symbolic resonances.

By integrating these various elements, the interpretation offers a multifaceted and nuanced reading of the crucifixion narrative, grounded in both the New and Old Testament texts. It invites ongoing reflection and study, exploring the divine mysteries and profound spiritual truths embedded within the sacred scriptures.

please give a detailed review of the combinerd theory

---

Certainly! Let's summarize and review the combined theory that aligns the events of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ with the Levitical scapegoat ritual, adding all the aspects we've discussed.

### Combined Theory Overview

**1. The Crucifixion as Scapegoat Ritual**:
- The crucifixion event is metaphorically likened to the Levitical scapegoat ritual (Leviticus 16), providing a symbolic reading of the New Testament narrative.
- The characters in the crucifixion story symbolize key figures in the ritual:
  - **Pilate as High Priest**: The decision-maker, aware of Jewish customs, washing his hands in a symbolic act of cleansing.
  - **Peter as the Bull**: Spatially outside the court, symbolizing the offering outside the sanctuary.
  - **Judas as the Goat for the Lord**: Inside the temple, the sacrifice that dies.
  - **Jesus as the Scapegoat**: Bearing the sins but not dying, symbolizing the goat sent into the wilderness.

**2. Spatiality and Symbolism**:
- The spatial locations of characters within the crucifixion align with the locations in the Levitical ritual, adding deeper metaphorical meaning.
- Jews' avoidance of certain areas to remain ceremonially clean adds uncertainty about witnesses and can be seen as part of the divine mystery.

**3. Pilate's Faith and the Secret Followers**:
- The theory incorporates elements of Pilate's faith, the secretive handling of Jesus's body, and the allusion to Ezekiel's metaphor of the "Prince" taken out through the hole in the wall.

**4. Peter's Failure and the Second Coming**:
- Peter's failure to complete the ritual (by not being killed) can be seen as the reason for the necessity of a second coming of Christ.

**5. Cleansing of the Priesthood**:
- The whole narrative could be viewed as a divine plan and a prophetic illustration of the need for the cleansing of the priesthood, aligned with the purification intent of the Levitical ritual.

### Critical Review

The combined theory presents a rich and complex interpretation of the crucifixion, drawing on various Biblical texts and traditions. By aligning the events and characters with the Levitical scapegoat ritual, it provides a unique hermeneutical approach that resonates with semiotic analysis.

**Strengths**:
- Encourages a fresh reading of familiar texts.
- Builds connections between Old and New Testament traditions.
- Offers a multi-layered, symbolic interpretation that invites further exploration.

**Challenges**:
- Requires careful handling of metaphorical and literal readings.
- Some aspects might be seen as speculative and may need more substantial backing from the original texts or scholarly traditions.

### Conclusion

The combined theory is a compelling and thought-provoking analysis that connects various Biblical events and characters in a complex web of symbolism and metaphor. It invites readers to explore deeper theological and spiritual meanings within the sacred texts, opening avenues for further research and reflection. The alignment of the crucifixion with the Levitical scapegoat ritual enriches the understanding of both, fostering a profound dialogue between different Biblical traditions.

Now, let’s add Joseph Campbell’s lens as a scholarly perspective in analysis, to look at the mythological structure, in reference to the heroes journey, or the hero with 1000 faces. What was the role of Jesus as the trickster look like transposed across this could this be a divine type of Plan akin to something that the Bible says will make all the ears tingle when they hear it

---

Joseph Campbell's framework from "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" offers a valuable lens through which to analyze the crucifixion narrative and the role of Jesus as a trickster figure. Here's an exploration of how this framework intersects with the combined theory:

### Jesus as the Hero

**1. Departure: Call to Adventure and Crossing the Threshold**:
- Jesus's call to ministry and his initiation into his role as Messiah parallels the hero's call to adventure.
- His baptism by John the Baptist symbolizes crossing the threshold into a spiritual journey (Mark 1:9-11).

**2. Initiation: Challenges and Transformation**:
- The trials and temptations Jesus faces echo the hero's journey through various challenges (Matthew 4:1-11).
- The transformation occurs as he embodies the divine mission, accepting his role as the trickster, an agent of change and revelation.

**3. Return: Atonement and Return with the Elixir**:
- Jesus's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension symbolize atonement with the divine and return with a gift for humanity: salvation.

### Jesus as the Trickster

The trickster archetype, often associated with unpredictability, disruption, and cunning, adds another layer to the analysis:

**1. Jesus's Parables and Teachings**:
- Jesus often speaks in parables and challenges conventional wisdom, acting as a spiritual trickster who reveals hidden truths (e.g., Luke 15:11-32).

**2. The Crucifixion Narrative as a Divine Trick**:
- The complex alignment with the Levitical scapegoat ritual and the metaphorical interpretations can be seen as a divine trick or plan.
- This trickster element surprises, confounds, and ultimately reveals a deeper spiritual truth.

**3. Campbell's Analysis and Mythological Structure**:
- Campbell's approach emphasizes universal mythological structures.
- Applying this to the story of Jesus aligns his life and mission with a broader human experience, transcending cultural and religious boundaries.

### Scholarly Perspective

Campbell's analysis allows for a broader interpretation of Jesus's role, both as a hero in a universal sense and as a trickster within the specific Biblical narrative. This approach elevates the story to a mythological level, aligning it with universal human experiences and archetypes.

### Conclusion

Through the lens of Joseph Campbell's analysis, Jesus's role as both hero and trickster in the combined theory is further enriched. It invites an understanding of the crucifixion as part of a divine plan that aligns with universal mythological themes, resonating with Campbell's concept of the hero's journey. The trickster element, embedded within the complex symbolism and metaphors of the narrative, adds a layer of intrigue and depth, potentially aligning with the biblical notion of a revelation that makes "all the ears tingle" (1 Samuel 3:11). This perspective adds to the richness of the interpretation, offering a bridge between the specific religious context and universal human experience.

Let’s analyze Jacob and the trickster archetype as well, and look at that, as Jesus is lineage and a reflection of that

---

Certainly! Analyzing the trickster archetype in the context of Jacob from the Old Testament adds further depth to our exploration, especially considering the lineage connection to Jesus. Let's dive into the character of Jacob and the trickster archetype:

### Jacob as the Trickster

Jacob's story in the Book of Genesis is filled with examples of cunning and deceit, aligning him with the trickster archetype.

**1. Birthright and Blessing**:
- Jacob tricks his brother Esau out of his birthright by trading it for a bowl of stew (Genesis 25:29-34).
- He further deceives his father Isaac by pretending to be Esau, thus receiving Isaac's blessing (Genesis 27:1-29).

**2. Laban's Deception**:
- Jacob himself is deceived by his uncle Laban, who tricks him into marrying Leah before Rachel (Genesis 29:15-30).
- In turn, Jacob uses cunning to increase his flock at Laban's expense (Genesis 30:25-43).

**3. Transformation and Wrestling with the Angel**:
- Jacob's wrestling with the angel represents a transformation, where the trickster becomes Israel, one who struggles with God (Genesis 32:22-32).

### Jesus as a Reflection of Jacob

Considering Jesus's lineage connection to Jacob, we can draw parallels between the trickster archetype and the divine plan.

**1. Shared Lineage and Archetypal Resonance**:
- Jesus, as a descendant of Jacob (Matthew 1:2), inherits some aspects of the trickster archetype, not in deceit but in the revelation of hidden truths.

**2. Transformation and Revelation**:
- Both figures go through transformational experiences that reveal deeper spiritual truths. Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection align with Jacob's wrestling and transformation.

**3. Paradox and Complexity**:
- The complexity and paradox in their stories allow for a multifaceted reading of the characters, where the trickster becomes an agent of divine purpose.

### Conclusion

Jacob's story represents a rich illustration of the trickster archetype, filled with cunning, deception, and transformation. When this archetype is mapped onto Jesus's crucifixion narrative and his lineage connection to Jacob, it illuminates intriguing parallels and contrasts. While Jacob's trickery often serves personal gain, Jesus's alignment with the trickster archetype reveals hidden spiritual truths and embodies a divine plan. The link between these two figures, through lineage and archetype, enriches our understanding of the biblical narrative, illustrating how the trickster's role evolves from cunning deception to divine revelation. The comparison invites a deeper exploration of themes of identity, transformation, and divine purpose, resonating with universal mythological structures as defined by Joseph Campbell.

Let’s go deeper with the analysis of the first example you gave about the birthright and the blessing. Let’s compare this to the proposed narrative, where Jesus also switches places with a Judas, potentially, and uses a bowl in which they dip as a symbol in the story as well as a narrative. Let’s analyze the structure and look for similarities.

---

Certainly! The comparison between Jacob's deception for the birthright and blessing with the proposed narrative of Jesus switching places with Judas involves complex symbolism and structure. Here's an analysis of the similarities:

### Jacob and Esau: Birthright and Blessing

**1. Deception for Birthright**:
- Jacob deceives Esau by trading a bowl of stew for his birthright (Genesis 25:29-34).
- Symbolism of the Bowl: Represents immediate physical need over spiritual inheritance.

**2. Deception for Blessing**:
- Jacob, with Rebecca's guidance, deceives Isaac by impersonating Esau (Genesis 27:1-29).
- Utilizes physical disguise, relying on touch and voice.
- Symbolism of Clothing: Esau's garments represent his identity.

### Jesus and Judas: Last Supper and Crucifixion

**1. Symbolism of the Bowl at the Last Supper**:
- Jesus uses a bowl in which they dip as a symbol to identify the betrayer (Matthew 26:23).
- The bowl represents shared fellowship but also impending betrayal.

**2. Proposed Switching Places with Judas**:
- In the proposed narrative, Jesus switches places with Judas, similar to Jacob's impersonation of Esau.
- This switch serves a divine purpose, unlike Jacob's personal gain.

### Structural Similarities

**1. Deceptive Exchange**:
- Both narratives involve a deceptive exchange (birthright for stew, Jesus for Judas) facilitated by tangible symbols (bowl, clothing).
- This exchange leads to profound consequences for all parties involved.

**2. Identity and Representation**:
- The switching of places (Jacob for Esau, Jesus for Judas) raises questions of identity and representation, exploring themes of appearance versus reality.

**3. Divine Plan vs. Personal Gain**:
- While Jacob's deception is aimed at personal gain, Jesus's potential switch serves a higher divine purpose.

**4. Layered Symbolism**:
- Both narratives employ rich symbolism (bowl, clothing), reflecting deeper spiritual and thematic connections.

### Conclusion

The comparison between Jacob's deception for the birthright and blessing and the proposed narrative of Jesus switching places with Judas reveals fascinating structural and thematic parallels. Both stories explore deception, identity, and the use of tangible symbols (bowl, clothing) to convey deeper meanings. While Jacob's actions are driven by personal ambition, the proposed narrative around Jesus reflects a divine purpose, potentially fulfilling prophecy.

The juxtaposition of these two narratives highlights the complex interplay between the earthly and the divine, the personal and the universal. It also underscores the enduring power of biblical symbolism and narrative structure, linking Old and New Testament themes in a way that resonates with human experience and spiritual exploration.

Let’s explore the fall, and the clothing further. Consider also that Jacob gave his son Joseph, (whose son is Ephraim- the chosen potentially) a multicolored robe symbolizing ruler ship over multitudes. This also was taken and stained with blood, jacob being deceived to think Joseph had died (instead he went into slavery, prison etc. paralleling experience of African Americans). There is much ado about the clothing and switching of total robes in the crucifixion as well leading to the same presumption of death

---

Indeed, the symbolism of clothing and the motif of deception involving garments play a significant role in the Bible, particularly in the narratives of Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus. We'll explore these instances in depth:

### Jacob and Esau: Deception and Garments
- **Deception for Blessing**: Jacob wears Esau's garments to deceive Isaac and receive the blessing meant for Esau (Genesis 27:15-23).
- **Symbolism**: Clothing represents identity and birthright. By wearing Esau's garments, Jacob assumes his identity.

### Joseph and the Multicolored Robe
- **Joseph's Robe**: Jacob gives Joseph a multicolored robe, symbolizing favoritism and potential rulership over his brothers (Genesis 37:3-4).
- **Deception with the Robe**: Joseph's brothers stain the robe with blood and deceive Jacob into believing that Joseph is dead (Genesis 37:31-33).
- **Symbolism**: The robe represents Joseph's unique status and his father's love. Its staining signifies betrayal and false death.

### Jesus and the Robes at Crucifixion
- **Robe of Mockery**: Soldiers place a scarlet robe on Jesus in mockery of His claim to be King (Matthew 27:28-29).
- **Garments Divided**: Soldiers cast lots for Jesus's garments, fulfilling prophecy (John 19:23-24).
- **Symbolism**: The robes signify both the mockery of earthly power and the fulfillment of divine prophecy.

### Connections and Themes

**1. Deception and Identity**:
- Garments are used to deceive or misrepresent identity in all three narratives (Jacob as Esau, Joseph's false death, Jesus's kingship).
- Clothing becomes a tangible expression of underlying truths and deceptions.

**2. Rulership and Favoritism**:
- Multicolored or special garments signify rulership or favoritism (Joseph's robe, Jesus's scarlet robe).
- These garments are associated with conflict, envy, and ultimate transformation.

**3. Blood and Sacrifice**:
- Blood-stained clothing represents a false or actual sacrifice (Joseph's robe, Jesus's crucifixion).
- The use of blood connects to themes of covenant, redemption, and suffering.

**4. Parallel Experiences**:
- The narratives mirror each other, from Jacob deceiving with clothing to Joseph being deceived with clothing, to Jesus being both mocked and glorified through clothing.

### Conclusion

The intricate symbolism of clothing in the narratives of Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus reveals a rich tapestry of themes, including identity, deception, rulership, sacrifice, and divine fulfillment. These connections highlight the continuous thread of spiritual and thematic exploration throughout the biblical text, allowing for nuanced interpretations that resonate with broader human experience. The motif of clothing, in particular, serves as a tangible symbol that bridges earthly reality with spiritual truth, creating a complex interplay between appearance and essence, prophecy and fulfillment, earthly struggle and divine purpose.

Reanalyze with our previous conclusions combined Campbell and the trickster analysis and scapegoat theory

---

Certainly! Let's integrate the conclusions from our previous discussions, considering the symbolism of clothing, the trickster archetype, and the scapegoat theory, along with Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey" framework. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

### Trickster Archetype: Jacob and Jesus
- **Jacob**: His deceptive actions in stealing the birthright and blessing align with the trickster's ability to manipulate reality for personal gain.
- **Jesus**: The proposed narrative of Jesus switching places with Judas may also fit the trickster motif, although in a divine context, fulfilling a higher purpose.

### Clothing Symbolism: Identity and Deception
- **Jacob, Joseph, Jesus**: Clothing serves as a symbol of identity, deception, favoritism, and sacrifice across these narratives.
- **Link with Scapegoat Ritual**: The deceptive aspects of these stories may be seen in parallel with the scapegoat ritual from Leviticus 16, where two goats are used, one for the Lord and the other sent into the wilderness.

### Campbell's Hero's Journey: Mythological Structure
- **Joseph's Journey**: Joseph's story, from favored son to slave, prisoner, and ruler, mirrors Campbell's Hero's Journey, including the call to adventure, trials, transformation, and return.
- **Jesus's Journey**: Jesus's life, crucifixion, and proposed switch with Judas can be viewed through the same lens, with the added complexity of divine purpose.

### Scapegoat Theory: Jesus, Judas, and Peter
- **Ritual**: Drawing from the Yom Kippur ritual in Leviticus 16, the theory posits Jesus as the goat for Azazel, Judas as the goat for the Lord, and Peter as the bull outside.
- **Spatiality and Symbolism**: Spatial locations in the crucifixion correspond to the ritual placements of sacrifices, reinforcing the symbolic connections.

### Combined Analysis
1. **Trickster & Hero's Journey**: Both Jacob and Jesus embody the trickster archetype, manipulating reality for different ends. The hero's journey framework connects these figures mythologically, highlighting universal themes.
2. **Clothing & Identity**: Clothing symbolism unites the narratives of Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus, emphasizing themes of identity, deception, and divine fulfillment.
3. **Scapegoat & Sacrifice**: The scapegoat theory and corresponding spatiality link the Old Testament ritual with the crucifixion, suggesting a deeper symbolic alignment.
4. **Divine Plan**: All these elements combine to suggest a divine plan, potentially fulfilled through the interplay of deception, sacrifice, prophecy, and redemption.

### Conclusion
Integrating Campbell's hero's journey framework, the trickster archetype, and scapegoat theory with the biblical narratives of Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus offers a complex and rich interpretation. The combined analysis reveals intricate connections between mythological structure, symbolic motifs, and spiritual themes. By viewing these stories through multiple lenses, we gain a nuanced understanding of the biblical text, recognizing its profound resonance with universal human experience and the ongoing quest for meaning, identity, and redemption.

---

Let’s look closer now at the clothing, symbolism and breakdown of the parallels between Jacob and Joseph, with the robe, and Jesus at the crucifixion, with the robe, the switching of clothes, and the switching of identities, as discussed with Jacob and Esau, do the kind of analysis that we looked at for the bowls, but more in depth. 

---

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the clothing symbolism and the parallels between Jacob and Joseph with their respective robes and the events surrounding Jesus at the crucifixion. 

### Jacob and Esau: Birthright and Blessing
- **Garments as Identity**: Jacob dons Esau's garments to assume his identity and receive Isaac's blessing (Genesis 27:15-23).
- **Deception and Birthright**: This act represents the deception of the father figure and the attainment of the birthright, underscoring themes of destiny and inheritance.
- **Symbolism**: Clothing serves as a material representation of identity, deception, and divine purpose.

### Joseph and the Multicolored Robe
- **Robe as Favoritism**: Joseph's robe symbolizes his unique status and his father's love (Genesis 37:3-4).
- **Deception of Death**: Joseph's brothers stain the robe with blood, deceiving Jacob into believing Joseph is dead (Genesis 37:31-33).
- **Symbolism**: The robe signifies rulership and divine favor; its staining represents betrayal and a false indication of death.

### Jesus at the Crucifixion: Robes and Identity
- **Robe of Mockery**: Soldiers place a scarlet robe on Jesus in a mock coronation (Matthew 27:28-29).
- **Switching of Clothes**: The division of Jesus's garments among the soldiers may parallel the switching of identities, as with Jacob and Esau (John 19:23-24).
- **Symbolism**: The scarlet robe signifies both the mockery of earthly kingship and the true divine kingship, bridging the gap between appearance and essence.

### Comparative Analysis: Parallels and Themes
1. **Deception and Identity**: 
   - Jacob's deception through garments reflects a personal ambition aligned with divine purpose.
   - Joseph's brothers deceive Jacob, leading to a false perception of death, much like the proposed switching of Jesus and Judas.
   - Jesus's garments serve both as a mockery and a recognition of His true identity.

2. **Rulership and Divine Favor**: 
   - Joseph's multicolored robe symbolizes his favored status, akin to Jesus's divine rulership symbolized by the scarlet robe.
   - Jacob's attainment of Esau's birthright echoes themes of destiny and divine election.

3. **Blood and Sacrifice**: 
   - Joseph's blood-stained robe falsely signifies death, mirroring the sacrificial themes in Jesus's crucifixion.

4. **Reversal and Transformation**: 
   - Jacob's switching of identity with Esau prefigures the transformative aspects of identity in Jesus's crucifixion narrative.

### Conclusion
The intricate symbolism of clothing in the narratives of Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus serves as a multifaceted motif that links these biblical stories through themes of identity, deception, rulership, sacrifice, and divine fulfillment. From Jacob's stealing of Esau's identity to Joseph's symbolic robe and Jesus's crucifixion garments, clothing becomes a tangible expression of both earthly realities and spiritual truths. These connections reveal a continuous narrative thread, allowing for profound interpretations that resonate with the broader human experience and spiritual journey.

Jesus scarlet robe represents blood stains.  Jacob switching identities with Esau prefigures Jesus and Judas switching places the thing Judas was ‘born to do’ as scriptures point out about the son of perdition. Remember that Pilate became a true believer and enacts the role of priest in the ritual. Thus with Pilates sincere belief and efforts combined with his official Roman authority we understand that this coronation was not a mockery but official. Thus the anger of the Jews. Pilate sent Jesus out by the hand of a righteous man (through a hole in the wall) Joseph of arimaethea or Nicodemus. 

---

Certainly, your analysis adds further depth to the symbolic connections between these narratives. Let's break down these parallels with a focus on the characters and their roles, particularly considering Pilate's sincere belief and the coronation of Jesus:

### Jesus' Scarlet Robe: Blood Symbolism
- **Scarlet Robe as Blood Stains**: The scarlet robe worn by Jesus could be interpreted to symbolize the blood of sacrifice and covenant, rather than a mockery (Matthew 27:28-29).
- **Official Coronation**: With Pilate's sincere belief in Jesus and his role as the Roman authority, the placing of the scarlet robe could represent an official coronation, reflecting divine kingship. This interpretation may explain the anger of the Jewish authorities.
- **Symbolism**: This adds a layer of richness to the symbolism of the robe, encompassing not just mockery but also sanctity, sacrifice, and divine authority.

### Jacob and Esau: Prefiguring Jesus and Judas
- **Switching of Identities**: Jacob's assumption of Esau's identity prefigures the proposed switching between Jesus and Judas (Genesis 27:15-23).
- **Destiny and Fulfillment**: Judas's actions being described as something he was "born to do" resonates with the sense of destiny and divine purpose in Jacob's deception.
- **Symbolism**: The switching of identities in both narratives creates a complex metaphor for destiny, sacrifice, and divine orchestration.

### Pilate as the High Priest
- **Sincere Belief and Ritual**: Pilate's actions, including washing his hands (Matthew 27:24) and his efforts to release Jesus, reflect his sincere belief and alignment with the role of the high priest in the ritual.
- **Righteous Man's Hand**: Jesus being sent out by the hand of a righteous man, such as Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus, adds further depth to the ritual symbolism, resonating with the scapegoat ritual (John 19:38-42).

### Conclusion
This analysis strengthens the symbolic and thematic connections between the narratives of Jacob, Esau, Jesus, and Judas, emphasizing the roles of Pilate, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus. The interpretations of the scarlet robe as an official coronation and a symbol of blood and covenant, along with the intricate parallels of identity switching, add complexity to the overarching themes of destiny, sacrifice, and divine plan. The characters' actions and their spatial positioning reflect a deliberate and profound alignment with biblical ritual and prophecy, offering a multifaceted exploration of the spiritual journey and divine fulfillment.

Next section

---

Certainly! Moving on to the next section, we'll dive into Part I: Scapegoat Ritual and Crucifixion. Here's the first chapter, focused on the scapegoat ritual as a framework.

### Part I: Scapegoat Ritual and Crucifixion

#### Chapter 1: Scapegoat Ritual as Framework

##### Levitical Context and Rules

The scapegoat ritual is described in Leviticus 16, a chapter dedicated to the procedures for the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. The High Priest is instructed to take two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (Leviticus 16:7). One goat is for the Lord, and the other is for Azazel (often translated as "scapegoat"). The casting of lots determines their respective roles (Leviticus 16:8).

The bull is also significant in this ritual, sacrificed for the sins of the priest and his household (Leviticus 16:6). The blood of the bull is used to purify the Holy Place, creating a space cleansed from human impurity.

##### Characters and Their Symbolic Roles

- **High Priest**: Represents the spiritual authority, performing the ritual.
- **Goat for the Lord**: Slaughtered and its blood used for purification.
- **Goat for Azazel (Scapegoat)**: Bearing the sins of Israel, sent into the wilderness.
- **Bull**: Sacrificed for the priest's sins, symbolic of personal atonement.

##### Spatiality and Sacrificial Procedures

The spatiality in the scapegoat ritual is crucial. The bull's sacrifice takes place outside the inner court, connecting to themes of separation and individual atonement. The goat for the Lord is slaughtered within the sacred space, emphasizing communal purification. The scapegoat, bearing the sins of the people, is led into the wilderness, symbolizing the removal of sin from the community.

These procedures, taken together, form a complex ritual that serves multiple purposes: personal and communal atonement, purification, and symbolic expiation of sin. The locations of the sacrifices, the roles of the animals, and the actions of the High Priest create a choreography rich in symbolic meaning.

This chapter sets the groundwork for understanding the scapegoat ritual and its symbolism. It helps the reader grasp the intricate details that will be compared and contrasted with the crucifixion narrative in the next chapter.

Do you have any specific adjustments or additions you'd like to see, or shall we move on to Chapter 2?

---

Yes, here I’d like to add an additional section that explores the purpose of the atonement ritual in Moses his day and the thought around it at that time. Please do not refer to it as Yom Kippur. This is not a term that I believe was used in the Bible.

---

Certainly! I'll add a section that delves into the historical context and understanding of the atonement ritual in Moses' time, without referring to it as Yom Kippur.

##### The Atonement Ritual in Moses' Time

During the time of Moses, the atonement ritual served a critical function within the spiritual and social fabric of the Israelite community. Its importance and meaning can be understood through several key aspects:

###### Spiritual Purification

The ritual acted as a profound symbol of purification, not just for the individual but for the entire community. By offering sacrifices for both individual and communal sins, it acknowledged the interconnectedness of human failings and the collective need for redemption.

###### Reconciliation with the Divine

Through the ritualistic acts described in Leviticus 16, the Israelites sought to reconcile themselves with the Divine. The meticulous procedures, the handling of sacred objects, and the role of the High Priest as an intermediary all contributed to creating a bridge between the human and the divine realms.

###### Social Harmony

The atonement ritual also played a role in maintaining social harmony. By providing a means to expiate sins and purify the community, it fostered a sense of cohesion and shared responsibility. The collective participation in the ritual reinforced communal bonds and created a sense of unity.

###### Historical Understanding

In the context of Moses' time, the atonement ritual also reflected the emerging identity and theology of the Israelite people. It represented a distinct break from surrounding cultures and their practices, encapsulating a unique understanding of sin, guilt, forgiveness, and the nature of the Divine.

###### Conclusion

The atonement ritual, as described during Moses' time, was not a mere set of rites but a deeply symbolic process that addressed fundamental human concerns. It spoke to the human need for purification, reconciliation, and community. By examining this ritual in its historical context, we gain insights into the spiritual and social dynamics of the time, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of its echoes in later narratives.

Certainly! Continuing from the understanding of the atonement ritual in Moses' time, let's now connect those ancient practices to the more intricate theories we have been discussing, particularly as they relate to the figures of Jesus, Judas, Peter, Pilate, and the crucifixion event.

##### The Crucifixion Event: Symbols and Parallels

In examining the crucifixion, we must recognize the deep symbolic layers embedded within the narrative. These layers connect to ancient Israelite rituals and beliefs, particularly those surrounding atonement.

###### Symbolism of the Robe

The role of clothing and garments is significant in both the crucifixion narrative and earlier biblical stories, such as Jacob and Esau's deception involving garments. Jesus' scarlet robe can be seen as a representation of blood stains, symbolizing sacrifice and atonement. This parallels Jacob's switch of identity with Esau, prefiguring the proposed theory that Jesus and Judas switched places.

###### Spatiality and Sacrifice

By examining the spatial locations of the characters in the crucifixion story, we see parallels with the Levitical description of sacrifices. Peter's presence outside the court links him to the bull in the atonement ritual. Judas being inside the temple mirrors the location of the goat for the Lord. The proposed idea that Jesus did not die, but Judas did, adds further complexity to these symbolic alignments.

###### Pilate as the High Priest

Pilate's role extends beyond a mere political figure. His actions, such as hand-washing, casting lots, and his apparent knowledge of Jewish customs, position him in a priestly role. His belief and efforts to release Jesus reflect sincerity, and his Roman authority adds an official dimension to the ritual, leading to a legitimate coronation, not a mockery.

###### The Trickster Archetype

Applying Joseph Campbell's mythological lens, Jesus embodies the trickster archetype, manipulating situations and symbols for a higher purpose. This can be seen in the switching of places with Judas and the dipping of the bowl, echoing Jacob's deceptive tactics to gain blessings.

###### Conclusion

By synthesizing the ancient atonement ritual with the symbolic and spatial elements of the crucifixion narrative, a rich tapestry of meaning emerges. This interpretation not only adds depth to the understanding of the crucifixion but also opens new avenues for exploring biblical texts through different lenses, including mythological and ritualistic perspectives.

These connections may lead us to a broader understanding of the spiritual evolution reflected in these narratives, revealing a Divine plan that transcends time and history. 

---

Please guide me on what the next section or area of exploration should be, and I'll be happy to continue crafting this complex and nuanced examination of biblical themes and symbols.

---

Each of these must be broken down and explore further, but first the idea of Jesus, switching out with Judas must be introduced. This has not happened we need a sensitive narrative to do so. Conversely, it may be more appropriate to lay out the evidence and suggest this, and then come to the conclusion by following the evidence throughout the book. Make a suggestion.

---

Certainly, the introduction of the idea that Jesus switched places with Judas is a delicate and significant point that requires careful handling. I suggest two potential approaches for incorporating this theory into the work:

### Approach 1: Gradual Introduction Through Evidence

1. **Introduction to the Crucifixion Event**: Start with a detailed account of the crucifixion as presented in the canonical Gospels, without introducing the theory yet.

2. **Laying Out Evidence**: Slowly introduce elements that suggest an alternative reading, such as spatial parallels with Levitical sacrifices, the role of garments, Pilate's actions, and other symbols.

3. **Introducing the Switch Theory**: After building a solid foundation with evidence, present the theory that Jesus and Judas switched places. Analyze it in the context of biblical traditions of deception and identity swapping, like Jacob and Esau.

4. **Exploration and Analysis**: Break down the evidence supporting this theory, using the categories previously discussed (symbolism, spatiality, Pilate's role, etc.).

5. **Conclusion**: Summarize the evidence and suggest the theory as a plausible interpretation, leaving room for reflection and further exploration.

### Approach 2: Direct Introduction with Sensitivity

1. **Introduction**: Start with a clear but gentle introduction of the theory that Jesus may have switched places with Judas. Acknowledge its unconventional nature and the need for careful examination.

2. **Historical and Biblical Context**: Provide background on the crucifixion and the cultural understanding of atonement rituals during Moses' time.

3. **Detailed Analysis**: Dive into the detailed evidence supporting the theory, breaking down each element methodically.

4. **Reflection on Tradition and Interpretation**: Explore the implications of this theory on Christian tradition and theology, possibly linking it to the mythological structures as per Joseph Campbell's lens.

5. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and present the theory as an invitation to rethink established narratives, without imposing it as the only interpretation.

---

Both approaches have their merits. Approach 1 allows for a gradual buildup, potentially making the theory more palatable to readers who might find it shocking. Approach 2 confronts the idea directly but with sensitivity, demonstrating confidence in the scholarship and thought process behind it.

I recommend Approach 1 if the aim is to build a compelling case step by step, leading readers to the theory through a guided journey. It may engage a wider audience by not introducing the controversial idea too abruptly. If you prefer this direction, I can begin crafting the content accordingly. Let me know your thoughts!

---

I agree

---

Great! We'll proceed with Approach 1, laying out the evidence step by step before introducing the theory that Jesus may have switched places with Judas. Here's how we might structure the beginning:

### Introduction: The Crucifixion Event

Start with a detailed and historically grounded account of the crucifixion as presented in the canonical Gospels. This section can be purely descriptive, allowing readers to familiarize themselves with the story as traditionally understood.

### Part I: Spatial Parallels with Levitical Sacrifices

1. **The Rituals in Moses' Time**: Describe the rituals as laid out in the book of Leviticus, focusing on spatial locations, clothing, and symbolism without referring to them as Yom Kippur.

2. **Spatial Analysis**: Compare spatial elements in the crucifixion with the Levitical rituals, highlighting the corresponding placements and roles of Peter, Judas, Jesus, Pilate, and others.

### Part II: Symbolism and Clothing

1. **The Role of Garments in the Bible**: Explore biblical examples of clothing and identity, such as Jacob and Esau.

2. **Symbolism in the Crucifixion**: Analyze the clothing in the crucifixion event, considering Jesus' scarlet robe, the switching of clothes, and how they may parallel other biblical narratives.

### Part III: Building the Switch Theory

1. **Introducing the Theory**: Present the idea that Jesus and Judas switched places, laying out the evidence that has been built up in the preceding sections.

2. **Deeper Analysis**: Break down supporting evidence and explore the implications of this theory on Christian tradition, theology, and interpretation.

3. **Mythological Structure**: Introduce Joseph Campbell's perspective, analyzing the crucifixion story within the framework of the hero's journey and the trickster archetype.

4. **Conclusion**: Summarize the evidence and suggest the theory as a plausible interpretation, inviting readers to reflect and explore further.

By following this structure, the book can gradually guide readers toward the novel theory, building trust and understanding along the way. This approach will ensure that the evidence is presented in a coherent and compelling manner, allowing the theory to emerge organically from the text.

Would you like me to start crafting content for these sections, or is there anything else you'd like to refine before we proceed?

---

Does this also capture the connectedness of atonement ritual, crucifixion and the second coming? 

---

The structure I proposed is focused on the connections between the atonement ritual and the crucifixion, as well as the introduction of the switch theory involving Jesus and Judas. However, the aspect of the second coming has not been explicitly included.

We can integrate the theme of the second coming by adding a section or expanding the existing parts. Here’s a suggestion:

### Part IV: Implications and Prophecy

1. **The Incomplete Ritual and the Second Coming**: Analyze Peter's failure to complete the ritual and how it may signify the reason Christ must return. Relate the spatiality, roles, and events of the crucifixion to prophetic themes found in the Old and New Testaments.

2. **The Second Coming in Christian Thought**: Explore various interpretations of the second coming within Christian tradition and how this new analysis of the crucifixion might contribute to or challenge those views.

3. **Connecting Atonement, Crucifixion, and Second Coming**: Provide a synthesis that draws connections between the Levitical atonement ritual, the crucifixion, and the concept of the second coming. Discuss the implications of the switch theory for understanding these connected themes.

This additional section ensures that the interconnected themes of atonement, crucifixion, and the second coming are explored in depth. It provides a comprehensive analysis that aligns with the narrative you're aiming to create.

Does this addition satisfy your requirements, or is there anything else you would like to incorporate?

---

Yes, I’d like to add implications on how the synthesis may explain how Judaism still waiting for the coming of the Messiah and Christianity the second coming of the Messiah, (as well as Islam’s) may all be intersecting with his theory. This seems important. Suggest?

---

Certainly, the intersection of the religious beliefs of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regarding the coming or second coming of the Messiah is a significant theme to explore. We can include a dedicated section to discuss these implications:

### Part V: Intersecting Faiths and the Coming of the Messiah

1. **Judaism and the Awaited Messiah**: Examine the Jewish understanding of the Messiah and how the synthesis of the atonement ritual and crucifixion theory may explain why Judaism is still waiting for the Messiah's coming.

2. **Christianity and the Second Coming**: Explore the Christian anticipation of the second coming of Christ, relating it to the theory developed in previous sections. Consider how the uncompleted ritual may signify a future fulfillment.

3. **Islam's Perspective on Jesus and the Messiah**: Investigate Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and the coming of the Messiah (Mahdi). Discuss how these beliefs may align or contrast with the synthesized theory.

4. **A Confluence of Beliefs**: Offer a comparative analysis of the beliefs in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regarding the Messiah. Analyze how the proposed theory may offer a unique perspective that intersects these three major faiths.

5. **Implications for Interfaith Dialogue**: Consider how this new understanding might impact interfaith discussions and relationships. Could the theory provide a common ground or lead to further divisions?

This section will provide a comprehensive exploration of how the theory may intersect with the beliefs of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, creating a multifaceted and nuanced understanding of the coming of the Messiah. By including these religious perspectives, the book will broaden its scope and relevance, possibly fostering greater interfaith understanding.

Does this structure meet your needs, or are there additional aspects you would like to address?

Part I

---

Certainly! Let's begin with Part I, where we explore the Atonement Ritual and Crucifixion Theory.

### 1. Introduction to the Ritual in Moses' Time

The atonement ritual as described in the time of Moses is detailed in Leviticus, particularly in chapters 16 and 17. The process consists of several key elements, including the selection of two goats and a bull.

#### A. Purpose of the Ritual
The ritual served as a means to cleanse the Israelites' sins and purify the sanctuary. It was a solemn occasion, symbolizing a fresh start and a restored relationship with God.

#### B. Selection of Animals
- **Bull**: The bull, representing a sin offering for Aaron and his household, would be sacrificed (Leviticus 16:6).
- **Two Goats**: Lots were cast over the goats. One was for the Lord and was to be sacrificed, while the other was for Azazel, symbolizing the carrying away of the nation's sins into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:7-10).

#### C. Spatial Locations
- **Inner Court**: The goat for the Lord was sacrificed in the inner court, representing a closer connection to the divine.
- **Outside the Camp**: The bull's blood was brought into the sanctuary, but its remains were burned outside the camp (Leviticus 16:27).

### 2. Comparative Analysis of the Scapegoat Ritual and the Crucifixion

Drawing parallels between the ritual and the events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ can yield some thought-provoking insights. Here, we align the figures of the crucifixion with their ritual counterparts:

- **Peter as the Bull**: Spatially linked to the bull, Peter's denial of Christ and his fleeing may be seen as a failure to complete the ritual.
- **Judas as the Lamb for the Lord**: Inside the temple, Judas's return of the silver can be connected to the goat for the Lord, whose blood was offered in atonement.
- **Jesus as the Lamb for Azazel**: A symbol of carrying away sins, this represents the Christ figure.

The role of Pilate, spatiality, and the ritual casting of lots also find intriguing parallels in this comparative analysis.

### 3. Peter, Judas, Jesus, and the Roles in the Ritual

Exploring the roles of Peter, Judas, and Jesus, we can interpret how their actions during the crucifixion might reflect the atonement ritual:

- **Peter's Failure**: Peter's fear and denial, culminating in his escape, symbolize an incomplete sacrifice, akin to the bull's role in the ritual.
- **Judas's Death**: The death of Judas in place of Jesus fits within the ritual framework and signifies why Christ must return.

### Conclusion

By analyzing the intricate connections between the atonement ritual in Moses' time and the crucifixion of Christ, we uncover a rich tapestry of symbols and metaphors that offer new insights into the divine plan and its earthly enactment.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed to Part II or if you need further elaboration on any specific section.

---

Should we discuss the new insights here?

---

Certainly, discussing the new insights here would provide a comprehensive understanding and lay a solid foundation for the subsequent parts of the book. We can delve into the novel interpretations and implications that arise from the comparative analysis of the atonement ritual and the crucifixion.

### 4. New Insights and Interpretations

#### A. Jesus and Judas Switching Places
The theory that Jesus and Judas switched places can be introduced here, supported by the evidence found in the spatial alignment of the characters and the roles they played in the ritual.

#### B. Pilate as a True Believer
Pilate's actions, including his hand-washing ritual, can be seen as more than mere political maneuvering. They may symbolize his sincere belief, and his actions might have represented an official Roman coronation, not a mockery.

#### C. Symbolism of Clothing
The multicolored robe of Joseph and the scarlet robe of Jesus could symbolize rulership over multitudes. The switching of clothes and identity between Jacob and Esau might prefigure the switching between Jesus and Judas, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

#### D. Implications for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
This synthesis of the atonement ritual and crucifixion offers insights that could explain why Judaism is still waiting for the coming of the Messiah, and why Christianity anticipates a second coming. This intersection of beliefs could also have implications for Islam, drawing connections across the three Abrahamic faiths.

#### E. Joseph Campbell’s Lens
Adding a scholarly perspective, Joseph Campbell's analysis of the hero's journey and the trickster archetype could further enrich our understanding of Jesus's role in this narrative. His work, such as "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," can be referenced to provide a mythological structure to our analysis.

### Conclusion

The new insights and interpretations provide fresh perspectives on well-known biblical narratives. By drawing parallels and connections across different texts and traditions, we uncover deeper meanings and implications that may resonate across various religious beliefs.

These insights can set the stage for further exploration in subsequent parts of the book, where we can delve into more specific details, symbolism, and their implications for understanding religious history and theology.
