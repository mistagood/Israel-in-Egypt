# Debate Rules and Evidence



---

What are the actual rules for debating? So if I wanted to debate a topic from the perspective of one of my theories, for example, that Jesus Christ died, and the crucifixion narratives, is illogical, and that the Bible clearly supports a narrative that is logical, in which Jesus is attempting to perform an atonement ritual according to Moses' scapegoat. So what are the actual rules of debate that would be followed, and rules of evidence if there are any? What should the goals and presentation of facts or data look like?

In formal debate—whether academic, competitive, or philosophical—the structure is designed to ensure fairness, clarity, and logical rigor. If you're presenting a theory such as "the crucifixion narrative is illogical and Jesus instead performed the Mosaic scapegoat ritual," you'd want to follow principles grounded in *debate rules* and *rules of evidence*. Here's a breakdown of both:

---

### **I. Structure and Rules of Formal Debate**

**1. Proposition (Resolution or Thesis):**
   - Clearly state your claim. Example:  
     *"Resolved: The crucifixion of Jesus is a theological misinterpretation; the biblical evidence supports a Mosaic scapegoat ritual instead."*

**2. Sides:**
   - **Affirmative (Pro):** Defends the resolution (your position).
   - **Negative (Con):** Refutes the resolution.

**3. Time Structure (Adaptable for academic or public forums):**
   - Opening Statement (each side)
   - Rebuttals (addressing the opponent’s claims)
   - Cross-examination (optional in informal settings)
   - Closing Statement (summary and final arguments)

### **II. Rules of Evidence in Debate**

While not identical to legal standards, the following are principles of evidence in rational debate:

**1. Relevance:**
   - All evidence must directly support or refute the proposition. Avoid tangents or red herrings.

**2. Source Credibility:**
   - Use primary sources (e.g., biblical manuscripts, Hebrew texts, historical records).
   - Cite scholars, but distinguish between interpretation and direct evidence.

**3. Consistency and Internal Logic:**
   - Your argument must be coherent. If you argue for Mosaic consistency, show that Jesus' actions match Leviticus 16.

**4. Falsifiability and Refutability:**
   - Present a claim in a way that can be challenged, not dogma.
   - Acknowledge what kind of evidence would disprove your theory (this makes your argument stronger).

**5. Avoid Logical Fallacies:**
   - E.g., appeal to authority without support, straw man arguments, ad hominem attacks.

### **III. Presentation of Argument/Data**

**1. Opening Case (Affirmative):**
   - **Define terms.** E.g., what is “atonement”? What is “scapegoat” in Levitical context?
   - **Frame your theory.** Position it as a recovery of overlooked logic in scripture.
   - **Cite texts.** Quote Leviticus 16, Ezekiel 12, Isaiah 53, John 18–19. Show parallels.
   - **Establish logical flow.** E.g., "Jesus said, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice'—this contradicts crucifixion as sacrifice."

**2. Anticipate Objections (Apologetics Strategy):**
   - “But Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15…”  
     → Counter: “Paul was not an eyewitness and never quotes Jesus. The Gospels say Jesus withdrew, and Pilate found no guilt.”

**3. Rebut Opponent’s Claims:**
   - Be respectful and focused on claims, not people.
   - Use scripture to counter scripture, not emotion.

**4. Closing:**
   - Reinforce your key point: *The logical reading of scripture aligns with Jesus enacting a public atonement ritual, not being ritually sacrificed.*

---

### **IV. Goal of Debate**

- **Not to win emotionally.**
- **To make the audience think critically.**
- **To test your theory for internal coherence and scriptural fidelity.**

Debate is less about proving you're right, and more about showing your argument can *stand up to scrutiny, remain internally logical, and better explain the data than the alternative*.

Would you like a sample debate outline or opening statement for your atonement theory?

How about we do a mock debate where you can present the other side?

Perfect. Let's do a structured **mock debate** on the resolution:

**"Resolved: The crucifixion of Jesus is a theological misinterpretation; the biblical evidence supports that He performed the Mosaic scapegoat ritual instead."**

---

### **Format**
We’ll follow a simplified debate format:
1. **Opening Statement – Affirmative (You)**
2. **Opening Statement – Negative (Me, representing traditional crucifixion doctrine)**
3. **Rebuttal – Affirmative**
4. **Rebuttal – Negative**
5. **Closing Statements**

You’ll begin by presenting your opening argument affirming the resolution.

**When you're ready, please post your Opening Statement**, and I’ll respond in character defending the mainstream doctrine (Negative side). Let’s keep it respectful, academically grounded, and cite scripture when useful.

Ready when you are.
