What's the specific language that Moses uses when he commands that they should wear tassels and the blue cord?

The specific language Moses uses to command the wearing of tassels with a blue cord is found in the Book of Numbers. In **Numbers 15:37-41**, the Lord instructs Moses to speak to the Israelites and give them the following command:

> "The Lord said to Moses, 'Speak to the Israelites and say to them: Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel. You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the Lord, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by chasing after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes. Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.'"** (NIV)

### Key Elements of the Command:
1. **Tassels on the Corners of Garments**: The Israelites are instructed to make tassels (Hebrew: *tzitzit*) on the corners of their garments.
2. **Blue Cord (Tekhelet)**: Each tassel is to include a blue cord. This blue dye, known as *tekhelet*, was traditionally derived from a specific sea creature and symbolized the divine.
3. **Purpose**: The tassels serve as a visual reminder to keep the commandments of the Lord and to remain holy, avoiding the temptations of the heart and eyes.
4. **Continual Observance**: This is to be a practice for all generations to come, emphasizing its importance as a perpetual statute for the Israelites.

This command merges spiritual symbolism with everyday life, reminding the Israelites of their covenant with God and the importance of following His commandments.

Do any of the versions mention how many corners

---

Yes, the command regarding the tassels does imply a specific number of corners in the context of traditional garments worn by the Israelites. The command in **Numbers 15:38** mentions placing tassels "on the corners of their garments." While the verse does not specify the number of corners directly in most translations, it is understood within the context of traditional Jewish garments.

The word "corners" here is translated from the Hebrew word **"kanfei"** (כַּנְפֵי), which means "corners" or "wings." Traditional Jewish garments like the *tallit* (prayer shawl) or *tallit katan* (a smaller garment worn under clothes) are square or rectangular with **four corners**. Thus, the command has been interpreted to mean **four tassels**, one for each corner of these garments.

In **Deuteronomy 22:12**, a related verse states:
> “Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.” (NIV)

Here, the instruction is explicit about the **four corners**. Therefore, while Numbers 15:38 does not state the number explicitly, Deuteronomy 22:12 clarifies that it refers to **four corners**. This interpretation has been consistent in Jewish tradition regarding the *tzitzit* (tassels) to be worn on garments with four corners.
