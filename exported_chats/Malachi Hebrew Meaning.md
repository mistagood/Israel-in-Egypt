# Malachi Hebrew Meaning



---

What’s the Hebrew spelling and meaning of Malachi 

---



---

The Hebrew spelling of **Malachi** is:

**מַלְאָכִי**  
**Mal'akhi**

### Breakdown:
- **מַלְאָךְ (Mal’akh)** = *messenger* or *angel*  
- **-ִי (suffix “-i”)** = *my*

### Meaning:
**Malachi** means **“My Messenger”** or **“Messenger of Yah (God)”**.

This name is fitting, as the Book of Malachi presents messages directly from YHWH to Israel, and scholars debate whether Malachi was a personal name or simply a title referring to an anonymous prophetic voice—**“My messenger”** sent to warn and correct the people.

Would you like to explore if Malachi was a real person or a pseudonym, possibly even Ezra or someone else?

Mal’akh is a word itself?

---

Yes, **mal’akh (מַלְאָךְ)** is a full Hebrew word on its own.

### Here's the breakdown:

- **מַלְאָךְ (mal’akh)** = *messenger* or *angel*

It comes from the root **ל-א-ך (L-A-Kh)**, which is related to sending or being sent. In biblical Hebrew, **mal’akh** refers to any **messenger**, whether human or divine. Context determines whether it's translated as "messenger" or "angel."

### Examples:
- **Genesis 32:1** – “Jacob went on his way, and the **angels of God (mal'akhim Elohim)** met him.”
- **Malachi 3:1** – “Behold, I will send **my messenger (mal’akhi)**...”

So yes, **mal’akh** is a standalone word meaning “messenger,” and **Mal’akhi (Malachi)** is the possessive form—“**my messenger**.”
