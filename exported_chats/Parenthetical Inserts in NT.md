# Parenthetical Inserts in NT



---

Do the oldest copies or codexes of Bible manuscripts of the New Testament contain the parenthetical inserts that are in the Bible now, and many of the versions that are in parentheses? Do they have, for instance, the verse in the Gospel of John where it says he was talking about Judas who would betray Jesus when Peter declared that Jesus was the Christ and that to whom would they go? And Jesus says, haven't I chosen you and one of you is the devil? And in parentheses they have he spoke of Judas. So there are many instances like that, most of them surrounding Judas or that suggest that the author knew what Jesus was thinking or what someone was thinking rather than stating what they said or did. And these parenthetical inserts tend to give context, so I want to know if the oldest manuscripts that we have contain those same parenthetical inserts. Thank you.

Your question strikes at the heart of biblical textual criticism: **Did the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament include the interpretive parenthetical inserts we now see in modern Bibles—especially those concerning Judas, inner thoughts, or contextual clarifications?**

**The short answer is: No, many of these parenthetical statements are not present in the oldest and most reliable Greek manuscripts.** They appear to be **later scribal additions or editorial clarifications** that crept into the text over time, often with theological or narrative intent.

Let’s break it down with clarity:

---

### 1. **Parentheticals in Modern Bibles (like “He spoke of Judas...”)**
These are usually **editorial glosses** or **narrator interpretations**, not original quotes. The parenthetical insert you mention in **John 6:70-71**, for instance:

> *"Jesus answered them, 'Did I not choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.'*  
> _(He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him.)_"

The **italicized portion** is what you’re asking about.

---

### 2. **What do the earliest manuscripts show?**

- The **earliest Greek manuscripts** we have—such as **Papyri 66 and 75 (ca. 200–250 CE)**, **Codex Sinaiticus (ca. 325–360)**, and **Codex Vaticanus (early 4th century)**—**do contain some of these narrative clarifications**, but **not consistently**.
- These **clarifying statements** were likely part of the original gospel narratives **from a literary perspective**, not added later as marginal glosses in *every* case—but some were likely **inserted or expanded by scribes** as the text was copied and translated.
- In some cases, early versions (like the **Old Syriac, Coptic**, or **Latin**) lack these clarifications, suggesting they were added in the Greek transmission line.

So for **John 6:71**, the clarification "He meant Judas..." **is found in the earliest complete manuscripts** (Sinaiticus, Vaticanus), and many scholars believe it was part of the original narrative. But its **parenthetical format**—that is, being inserted as an aside—is a modern editorial decision. The **Greek text does not use punctuation** or parentheses in the way we do today.

---

### 3. **Why were these additions made?**

- To **clarify** to readers unfamiliar with the story who certain figures were (like Judas, Mary Magdalene, etc.).
- To **emphasize theological interpretations**, especially concerning betrayal, prophecy fulfillment, and Jesus’ foreknowledge.
- To smooth narrative transitions or fill in **what seemed ambiguous** to later readers.

In other cases—like in **John 12:6** (“He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief...”)—the comment on Judas is believed to be **a later addition** or at least **a developed editorial voice** not found in all ancient versions.

---

### 4. **How to verify?**

Scholars consult:
- **Critical editions** like the **Nestle-Aland (NA28)** or **UBS5 Greek New Testament**, which **note textual variants** and whether a phrase is **missing or added** in certain manuscripts.
- **Apparatuses** (footnotes) in these editions document which manuscripts support or omit certain phrases.
- Resources like the **CSNTM (Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts)** provide manuscript images for direct comparison.

---

### Conclusion

While some clarifying parentheticals are ancient, others are **later insertions**. Almost all of them **reflect theological interpretation** rather than pure reporting. The **earliest manuscripts often lack the explicit commentary** we see today, especially where inner thoughts or motives are attributed.

Would you like a verse-by-verse list of where these inserts appear and which manuscripts do or don’t support them?

You asked me if I wanted a verse-by-verse list of where the inserts appear and which manuscripts do and don't support them. I thought you were going to go through an entire list. And I also want to look at the manuscripts that we have from the first century and see what they have, the complete ones. Or not even total complete, but I want to look at Sinaiticus and the Vaticanus and all those others. The oldest ones is what I want to see.

### 🧾 Understanding Parenthetical Statements in the New Testament

Parenthetical statements in the New Testament often serve to provide clarification, commentary, or additional information. These can be:

1. **Narrative Clarifications**: Explanations added by the author or later scribes to clarify events or identities (e.g., identifying Judas as the betrayer).
