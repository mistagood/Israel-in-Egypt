# Female hyena anatomy



---

Is it the female jackal or the hyena that has a penis?

---



---

It is the **female hyena**, specifically the **spotted hyena** (*Crocuta crocuta*), that has a pseudo-penis. This structure is an elongated clitoris that closely resembles a male's penis and even contains a pseudo-scrotum. Female spotted hyenas give birth, urinate, and copulate through this organ, which makes their reproductive process uniquely challenging. This adaptation is believed to be linked to their highly competitive and matriarchal social structure.

Female jackals, on the other hand, do not have this characteristic.

What would a hyena-ant society look like if they were a mixed breed somehow.  Say created in a laboratory and got loose 

---

A **hyena-ant hybrid society**—a fusion of the **spotted hyena's** social intelligence and the **ant's** eusocial structure—would be a terrifyingly efficient, highly organized, and dominant force in any ecosystem they invaded. If such creatures were created in a laboratory and escaped, their society would likely develop along the following lines:

### **Hierarchy & Social Order**
- **Matriarchal Command Structure**: Like hyenas, this hybrid species would likely be female-dominated, with large, aggressive queens leading the colonies. However, instead of a single queen like in ant societies, there might be a **council of alpha females**, similar to how dominant hyena clans operate.
- **Castes & Roles**: Ants have rigidly defined worker, soldier, and reproductive castes, while hyenas have strong social hierarchies. The hybrid society might blend the two, where only the most dominant females reproduce, but subordinates still have roles like hunters, scouts, and enforcers.

### **Physical Traits & Hunting Strategies**
- **Swarm Hunting Tactics**: Ants overwhelm prey with sheer numbers, while hyenas use coordinated pack hunting. These hybrids might develop a **horde-based ambush style**, where large groups work together to take down even the most formidable prey.
- **Chemical Communication & Intelligence**: Ants rely on pheromones to coordinate movements, while hyenas use complex vocalizations and scent-marking. A hybrid species could combine these, using chemical trails to direct attacks while maintaining the **cunning of a mammalian predator**.
- **Exoskeletal Armor or Thickened Skin**: If they retained ant-like chitin, they might develop **natural armor**, making them difficult to injure. If more mammalian, they could have **reinforced hides** akin to rhinos or pangolins.
- **Gigantic Warrior Drones**: Some hybrids might be specialized for combat, acting as massive **soldier units** that defend the colony and attack threats en masse.

### **Reproduction & Expansion**
- **Mobile Hives**: Unlike ants, which stay in fixed colonies, the **hyena-ant hybrid might be nomadic**, moving in waves across the land, devouring everything in their path.
- **Egg-Laying Queens with Mammalian Gestation**: If they mix reproductive strategies, dominant females might give birth to **live offspring**, while subordinates lay eggs in protected underground nurseries.
- **Parasitic Reproduction**: Like some ants, they could **infiltrate other species' nests**, enslaving or brainwashing host creatures into serving their colony.

### **Impact on the Ecosystem**
- **Super-Predators**: They would likely **outcompete traditional carnivores** like lions or wolves, stripping entire regions of prey.
- **Terraformers of the Environment**: Their ability to tunnel underground (like ants) could destabilize landscapes, while their sheer numbers might alter entire ecosystems.
- **Unstoppable Expansion**: With both **mammalian endurance** and **insect efficiency**, they could quickly **spread worldwide**, making them nearly impossible to contain.

### **If They Escaped From a Lab...**
- **Global Catastrophe**: These hybrids could outbreed and out-hunt existing predators, leading to an **unstoppable plague of intelligent, carnivorous swarms**.
- **Human Conflict**: If they retained hyena intelligence, they might recognize humans as threats, leading to **targeted, strategic attacks** on human settlements.
- **Evolved Warfare**: If militaries tried to stop them, they might **learn counter-strategies**, using their sheer numbers and teamwork to **overrun even technologically advanced defenses**.

If such a species ever got loose, humanity might have only one option—**total extermination, or extinction.**
