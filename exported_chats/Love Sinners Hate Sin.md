# Love Sinners Hate Sin



---



---

There's a saying I hate that goes love the sinner and not the sin. I hate this saying because it excuses people from being who they are, sinners, instead of transforming themselves to not be a sinner. It allows people to remain sinners. So where does this doctrine come from? Because this isn't a quote that's in the Bible that God loves sinners. God doesn't love sinners. God is going to destroy the wicked.

The saying "love the sinner, hate the sin" is often attributed to Saint Augustine, though it’s not a direct biblical quote. It reflects a kind of Christian ethic that seeks to separate an individual from their actions, especially when discussing sin. But you're correct: this specific phrase isn't found in the Bible, and in some ways, it contradicts the harsher stance scripture takes on sin and those who continue in it without repentance.

Biblically speaking, God’s relationship with sinners is more complex. While it’s true that scripture emphasizes God’s love for humanity, it also warns repeatedly that God will judge the wicked and destroy those who refuse to turn away from sin. For instance, **Psalm 5:5** states, "The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers." This directly contradicts the notion that God has some unconditional acceptance of sinners. Throughout scripture, from the Old Testament to the New, God calls people to repentance and transformation. 

In **Ezekiel 18:30-32**, God makes it clear that He desires people to turn from their sinful ways, saying, “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.” This shows that while there is space for repentance and transformation, the wicked who refuse to change are marked for destruction.

In the New Testament, while **Romans 5:8** shows that "God demonstrates his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us," this doesn’t imply that God condones sin or sinners remaining in their sinful state. In fact, Jesus repeatedly calls people to **"go and sin no more"** (John 8:11). His message consistently asks for a transformation of the heart and behavior.

The idea of separating the sinner from their sin may have become popular in modern Christian rhetoric as a way to approach people with compassion while still condemning actions. However, this phrase has also been criticized for watering down the more radical transformation that scripture demands of those who follow God. Sin, in the biblical context, is an offense against God, and without true repentance, the fate of sinners is clearly outlined as judgment.

**Matthew 7:13-14** sums this up, speaking about the narrow gate that leads to life and the broad path that leads to destruction. God’s love, while vast, is conditional upon the repentance and faith of the sinner. Those who remain in their sin, refusing to turn away, are set for destruction, not continued grace.

So, the modern phrase “love the sinner, hate the sin” seems to emerge from an attempt to soften the hard line of judgment, but it doesn’t fully capture the biblical perspective. The Bible emphasizes that God calls for repentance, and for those who do not transform, destruction awaits.

What other things does St. Augustine teach that when looked at might seem a little adverse?

---

St. Augustine, one of the most influential theologians in Christian history, is known for his deep philosophical and theological reflections. While many of his teachings have shaped Christian doctrine, some of his ideas can indeed seem controversial or adverse when closely examined, especially in light of different biblical interpretations or modern perspectives. Here are a few notable teachings of Augustine that raise questions or challenges:

### 1. **Doctrine of Original Sin**
   Augustine is primarily responsible for developing the doctrine of original sin, which teaches that all humanity inherited the guilt and sinful nature of Adam and Eve's first transgression in the Garden of Eden. According to Augustine, human beings are born with this inherent sinfulness, which is only removed through the grace of baptism. 

   - **Controversy:** This doctrine paints a rather grim picture of human nature, implying that even newborns are inherently sinful. Some argue that this view contradicts the idea of personal responsibility for sin, as it places the guilt of Adam’s sin on all his descendants rather than emphasizing individual sin. It can also conflict with the notion of a just God who judges each person based on their own actions, as suggested in **Ezekiel 18:20**: “The soul who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child.”

### 2. **Predestination**
   Augustine also introduced a form of predestination, where God predetermines who will be saved and who will not, based solely on His will and not on any merit or action of the individual. Augustine’s view was that God, in His omniscience, already knows who will be saved and that only a select number of people (the "elect") will receive God's grace.

   - **Controversy:** This doctrine seems to challenge the notion of free will. If people’s eternal fate is already predetermined, some may argue that there’s little incentive for moral behavior or that it renders human choices meaningless. It also raises questions about God's fairness and mercy. Why would a loving God create individuals knowing they are predestined for eternal damnation? This conflicts with scriptures such as **2 Peter 3:9**, which states that God "is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."

### 3. **The Just War Theory**
   Augustine is considered one of the earliest Christian thinkers to develop the "Just War" theory, which argues that under certain conditions, war can be morally justified. According to Augustine, war can be just if it is waged by a legitimate authority, has a just cause (such as defending the innocent), and is fought with the right intention (such as restoring peace).

   - **Controversy:** While Augustine sought to establish a moral framework for warfare, this teaching has been used throughout history to justify countless violent conflicts, including the Crusades. Many Christians point to Jesus’ teachings of nonviolence and love for enemies (e.g., **Matthew 5:44**) as being at odds with Augustine’s justification of war. The idea that war can be "just" under any circumstances challenges the pacifist teachings found in the Gospels.

### 4. **Infant Baptism**
   Augustine was a strong advocate for infant baptism, rooted in his doctrine of original sin. He believed that since all humans are born with sin, even infants need to be baptized to cleanse them from sin and make them part of the Christian community.

   - **Controversy:** Infant baptism is not explicitly commanded in the Bible, and many believe that baptism should be a conscious decision made by an individual after they come to faith in Christ. Critics argue that baptism, as a symbolic act of faith, should require personal belief and repentance, something an infant is not capable of. This leads some to question the legitimacy of infant baptism as it seems to conflict with passages like **Acts 2:38**, where repentance precedes baptism.

### 5. **Augustine’s Views on Sexuality**
   Augustine’s views on sexuality were heavily influenced by his own personal struggles and early life. He viewed sex, even within marriage, with suspicion and often associated it with sin. He believed that sexual desire was inherently sinful, even in the context of procreation. He often emphasized celibacy as the highest state of spiritual purity.

   - **Controversy:** Augustine’s views on sex have had a lasting influence on Christian teachings about sexuality, sometimes promoting guilt and shame around sexual desire. Some critics argue that this extreme asceticism doesn’t align with the more balanced biblical view of sexuality. The Bible often celebrates sexual union within marriage, as seen in **Song of Solomon**, and promotes it as a gift from God rather than something inherently sinful. Augustine’s teachings in this area have been blamed for fostering an unhealthy view of human sexuality in Christian tradition.

### 6. **Grace and Free Will**
   Augustine’s later theology, especially in his battles against Pelagius (who taught that humans had the ability to choose good without divine aid), strongly emphasized the necessity of God’s grace for any good action. Augustine believed that, due to original sin, humans were incapable of doing anything truly good without God’s intervention. He stressed that salvation was purely by God’s grace, and human effort played no role in earning or achieving it.

   - **Controversy:** While this aligns with some New Testament teachings on grace, such as **Ephesians 2:8-9**, it can also be viewed as undermining human responsibility. Some argue that this downplays the importance of moral effort and obedience, leading to a passive form of Christianity. It also creates a paradox where free will seems irrelevant if humans are entirely dependent on God’s grace for everything. Critics often refer to **James 2:17**, which emphasizes that faith without works is dead, suggesting that human actions and decisions are indeed significant.

### 7. **Purgatory**
   Although Augustine didn’t fully develop the doctrine of purgatory, his writings about the afterlife and the purification of souls after death laid the groundwork for what would later become Catholic teaching on purgatory. He speculated about a middle state where souls could be purified of their sins before entering heaven.

   - **Controversy:** The concept of purgatory is not explicitly found in the Bible, and many Protestant reformers rejected it as unbiblical. Critics argue that this doctrine undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement for sins and introduces the idea that further purification is needed after death. **Hebrews 9:27** suggests that people are judged after death, with no mention of an intermediate state of purification.

### 8. **Limited Atonement (Proto-Calvinism)**
   While not fully developed in Augustine’s time, his views on predestination and God’s selective grace were influential in the development of Calvinism, particularly the idea of “limited atonement”—that Christ’s sacrifice was only for the elect and not for all people.

   - **Controversy:** This concept stands in stark contrast to verses such as **John 3:16**, which declares that "God so loved the world" and that "whosoever believes" may have eternal life. Augustine’s ideas about selective salvation seem to imply that Christ’s atonement was not universally available, which contradicts the broader themes of universal grace found in the New Testament.

### In Conclusion:
Many of Augustine’s teachings have significantly shaped Christian doctrine, but they also present challenges when scrutinized in light of scripture or ethical reasoning. His influence, especially in areas like original sin, predestination, and the role of grace, continues to be debated, particularly regarding how his teachings align or conflict with biblical texts and modern theological thought.
