Celebrity names that families are known to be in the doomsday book

The Domesday Book, completed in 1086, is a historical record of landholdings in England commissioned by William the Conqueror. It does not list families in the way we think of celebrity families today, but rather details landowners and their estates at the time. However, several historical figures and families that appear in the Domesday Book have notable descendants or connections to later famous figures. Here are a few:

1. **William the Conqueror**: As the ruler who commissioned the Domesday Book, his lineage includes many European royals. Descendants include numerous English monarchs.

2. **Robert of Mortain**: Half-brother to William the Conqueror, Robert was one of the largest landowners in the Domesday Book. His descendants include the Percy family, historically significant in British nobility.

3. **Hugh d'Avranches**: Known as Hugh Lupus, he was the Earl of Chester and one of the most powerful lords in England. His lineage continued to be influential in British aristocracy.

4. **Odo of Bayeux**: Another half-brother of William, he was the Bishop of Bayeux and Earl of Kent. Though his direct line did not remain prominent, he is remembered for his role in the Norman Conquest and his patronage of the Bayeux Tapestry.

5. **The De Vere Family**: The De Vere family, which held the title of Earl of Oxford, appears in the Domesday Book and was prominent throughout English history, including connections to Shakespearean studies, where some speculate Edward de Vere as a possible author of Shakespeare's works.

While these families are not "celebrities" in the modern sense, their historical impact and the prominence of their descendants have made them significant in British history.

Is there a list of American celebrities known to be from families in having their name in the doomsday book?

---

Tracing American celebrities back to families listed in the Domesday Book involves connecting them to British or European aristocracy with historical records that span nearly a thousand years. While this kind of genealogical research is complex, some American celebrities have well-documented family histories that claim descent from notable English families. Here are a few celebrities who have been linked to such lineages:

1. **Angelina Jolie**: Angelina Jolie's ancestry has been linked to European nobility, with connections to the House of Plantagenet, which includes figures such as King John of England, who is descended from some of the landowners mentioned in the Domesday Book.

2. **Hugh Grant**: Although primarily known as a British actor, Hugh Grant's ancestry includes connections to the House of Stuart and other noble families, with distant ties to historical figures recorded in the Domesday Book.

3. **Benedict Cumberbatch**: The British actor has genealogical ties to Richard III, whose ancestry can be traced back to several families mentioned in the Domesday Book.

4. **Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal**: The Gyllenhaal siblings have ancestry that reportedly connects to King Edward III of England, whose lineage includes several families documented in the Domesday Book.

5. **Ellen DeGeneres**: Ellen DeGeneres has been linked to King Edward III, providing a connection to families that were part of the medieval English aristocracy.

These connections are often based on genealogical research that traces family lines back through centuries. The accuracy of such claims can vary, as they rely on historical records that are sometimes incomplete or interpreted differently by researchers.

Here's a brief look at the ancestral backgrounds of Sean Penn, Jill Biden (Joe Biden's wife), and Paris Hilton, focusing on any connections to European nobility that might be linked to families from the Domesday Book:

1. **Sean Penn**: Sean Penn's ancestry is primarily of Ashkenazi Jewish descent on his father's side and Irish-Italian descent on his mother's side. There isn't a direct connection to English nobility or families listed in the Domesday Book known publicly.

2. **Jill Biden (née Jacobs)**: Jill Biden's ancestry is not widely publicized in terms of connections to European nobility. Her known ancestry is primarily of English, Scottish, and Sicilian descent. There are no well-documented ties to families in the Domesday Book.

3. **Paris Hilton**: Paris Hilton is a descendant of the prominent Hilton family, known for their hotel empire. Her ancestry includes connections to European aristocracy, such as Norwegian nobility and the House of Plantagenet, which potentially links her to historical families mentioned in the Domesday Book.

Genealogical research connecting modern individuals to historical figures often involves tracing family trees back through centuries, which can be complex and require access to detailed historical records. For those interested in more definitive connections, genealogical databases and specialized research may provide further insights.

Jill Biden is bluett.  Hilton is named. Penn is huge 

---

Here's a deeper look at the ancestral connections for Jill Biden, Paris Hilton, and Sean Penn, focusing on any historical ties that might link them to families mentioned in the Domesday Book:

1. **Jill Biden (née Jacobs)**: Jill Biden's ancestry includes a connection to the Bluett (or Blewett) family. The Bluetts are an ancient family with origins in England, and while specific records tying them directly to the Domesday Book are not widely cited, they have been a notable family in British history. The Bluetts were landowners and knights in the medieval period, which means their ancestors might have held lands during the time of the Domesday survey.

2. **Paris Hilton**: Paris Hilton is part of the Hilton family, who have a long history dating back to medieval England. The Hilton family name is linked to the de Hilton family, which was a significant landholding family in the north of England during the Norman period. This connection makes it plausible that her ancestors are connected to figures from the Domesday Book era.

3. **Sean Penn**: While Sean Penn is primarily of Jewish and Irish descent, the Penn name has historical significance in England. The Penn family has roots in Buckinghamshire, England, and although there isn't a direct line to the Domesday Book, the family's history in England dates back several centuries. The notable historical figure William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, is part of this lineage. However, the direct connection to Domesday Book families would require more specific genealogical research.

These connections highlight the fascinating links between contemporary figures and historical families, though direct ties to the Domesday Book are often more complex and require detailed genealogical research to confirm.
