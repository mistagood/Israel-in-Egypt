# Leviticus Temple Purification Prophecy



---

examining text of Leviticus 14 as prophetic instructions about Israel's future. Specifically this is about in the promised land and the temple being destroyed for uncleanness. It explains why, as Jesus knew, that the temple would be destroyed completely (not one stone left).  Because we see it was defiled as he went to drive out the plague of wickedness in the temple. The temple had been destroyed and rebuilt already reflecting the first part of Moses instructions to remove the stones and plaster, but in Jesus time he found it to still be infected requiring the demolished of the entire structure. this goes back to the metaphor of an untested wall being plastered, but it will fall. very importantly, the purification is a reflection of the atonement ritual - 2 animals but one is sacrificed and the blood is placed on the other that is released into the field. This reflects the scapegoat (Jesus) carrying away sin. Aside from the mainstream historical view that Jesus died on the cross, we see that Jesus actually was performing a scapegoat ritual in which he and another were presented to the crowd and Pilate acted as the high priest according to Leviticus 16. This process suggests that Jesus did not die on the cross just as many traditions (including Islam)have noted, but that he (if the scapegoat) must live to carry away sin and thus another prisoner died instead of Jesus that day. This is to fulfill what Ezekiel wrote about in Ezekiel 12 where the Son of Man enacts the prince going out secretly with his burden (referencing the cross) on his shoulder and all of his men are scattered. This great sign is not understood by Israel (Ezk 12) because to this day they are rebellious according to the scriptures. Yet traditional accounts take this to be about Hezekiah. But Ezekiel would differ as he Identifies the prince among them saying "I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them; I, the Lord, have spoken!" They are blind to the greater implications of the benefit of more modern history. They fail to account for Jesus as a better fit for the prophecy concerning the true King of Israel, having the title reserved for a time when "I the Lord will be there God", suggestion a divine appointment or association to the figure. Further, a burden borne on the shoulder is in modern times synonymous with the cross borne by a condemned man and the crucifixion. Jesus is the prince among them who went out secretly and this is why Ezekiel, called the "Son of Man" performs these signs about Israel. Would Jesus calling himself Son of Man all these years later and referencing the scattering of the disciples in one night not cause us to seek symmetry in his actions and Ezekiel?  In Leviticus 14 we see the precursor of mixing blood and 'running' water, later we see this in the man crucified when blood and water profusely pour from his side when pierced. The hyssop is present at the crucifixion, as well as the cedar representing the cross and the scarlet cloth representing the blood stained robe. All these symbols add up to a revelation that supports these conclusions. Moses warns against being turned away from God and believing in another atonement akin to not laid out in the law. Yet the law provides atonement through this process. The resurrection salvation championed by Paul allows for the mainstream interpretation of the so called crucifixion. Yet if Moses wrote of Jesus (for Moses wrote of me!) as Jesus said, and you believed Moses (and consequentially, Jesus), you would view this through a Mosaic lens. Now Jesus already has this orientation (not a 'Christian' orientation), plus his reference to himself as Son of Man, and the scattering in Ezekiel 12 indicate a strong connection.

**Examining theological interpretations**

I’m mapping out a unique theological argument that Jesus wasn't crucified but substituted by another prisoner, linking it to the scapegoat ritual and alluding to Islamic traditions.

**Connecting the dots**

I'm linking non-mainstream Christian interpretations with Islamic views, exploring the scapegoat ritual, and examining its ties to Leviticus 14 and the Temple's destruction to understand Jesus' crucifixion prediction.

**Crafting a detailed analysis**

I’m preparing to provide an in-depth analysis, comparing non-mainstream Christian interpretations with mainstream theological views, focusing on Leviticus, scapegoat rituals, and their implications for understanding uncleanness and the Temple's destruction.

**Evaluating interpretations**

It's interesting to see the user's alternative viewpoint, akin to some Islamic beliefs, juxtaposed with mainstream Christianity's traditional notion of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

---

Below is an overview and commentary on the various strands of interpretation you raised, noting both the mainstream views (Jewish and Christian) and how your own reading (with resonances in certain Islamic views) weaves together Leviticus 14, Leviticus 16, Ezekiel 12, and the Gospels. I will try to lay out the texts and typical interpretations, then highlight how you are connecting them in a more novel way.

---

## 1. Leviticus 14 and the Destruction of the Temple

### Leviticus 14 and Leprous Houses

- **Context of Leviticus 14:** The chapter gives instructions on how to purify someone (or something) from “tzara’at”—traditionally translated “leprosy,” but it could also mean various skin or surface blights. After treating an individual’s tzara’at, Leviticus 14:33–57 discusses how to handle a house with a spreading mildew or fungus (often likened to ‘leprosy’ on the walls).

- **Key Steps for a Diseased House:**
  1. **Inspection by a priest** to confirm the blight.
  2. **Removal of afflicted stones** and re-plastering.
  3. **If it reappears,** the entire house is dismantled and taken outside the city.
  4. **Cleansing Ritual** if the house is declared pure: Two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, using running water and blood in a symbolic ritual.

- **Interpretation as Prophetic of Israel’s (Temple’s) Fate:**  
  You connect this with the Temple:  
  - First destruction (587/586 BCE by Babylon) = The initial removal of “afflicted stones.”  
  - Rebuilding under Zerubbabel (and later refurbished by Herod) = The re-plastering.  
  - Second destruction (70 CE by Rome) = The entire house torn down, fulfilling the “not one stone left upon another” prophecy.  
  In your reading, this matches Leviticus 14’s logic: if the plague of impurity persists, the structure must be totally dismantled.

This is certainly a creative (and somewhat common in homiletic midrash) reading to see the “house” of Leviticus 14 as the Temple. Various Jewish and Christian interpreters, ancient and modern, have noted how the “house” can be analogized to Israel’s national “house,” culminating in Temple destruction and exile when spiritual defilement persists.

## 2. The Scapegoat Ritual (Leviticus 16) and Jesus’s Fate

### Standard Biblical/Christian Reading

- **Leviticus 16:** On the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), two goats are chosen. One is sacrificed as a sin offering; the other is the “scapegoat” (Heb. *Azazel* goat), which symbolically bears away the sins of the people into the wilderness.  
- **Traditional Christian Typology:** Jesus is often regarded as fulfilling both goats’ functions—He is the sacrificed one (His blood atones) yet also the one who “bears away” sin. Most Christian exegesis sees the crucifixion as the single culminating act that somehow unites both roles, with the resurrection completing the victory over sin and death.

### Your Alternative Reading

- **Pilate as High Priest?** You see the “two goats” scenario played out in the Gospels’ scene with Pilate, Jesus, and Barabbas. Pilate presents two prisoners, and the crowd chooses whom to release. In the canonical Gospels, Barabbas is released, and Jesus is condemned to crucifixion.  
- **But you invert the outcome**: you suggest that Jesus is actually the scapegoat that goes free and another prisoner (the “other goat”) is the one actually crucified. That is an interesting alignment with certain **Islamic** perspectives (e.g., some strands of Islamic interpretation suggest that someone else—often said to be a look-alike—was crucified in Jesus’s place, while Jesus was “lifted” alive). It differs from mainstream Christian doctrine that Jesus truly died on the cross.

### Points for Consideration

1. **Textual Warrant in the Gospels?**  
   - Canonical Gospels unanimously testify that Jesus Himself was crucified. In Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John, the narrative puts Jesus on the cross, and Barabbas is the one released.  
   - There is no direct textual suggestion that Jesus escaped crucifixion. The cry of dereliction, the spear in His side, the burial, and so on are integral to the Gospel accounts.  

2. **Scapegoat Necessity to Live:**  
   - In the Levitical ritual, yes, the scapegoat is indeed set free alive into the wilderness. However, **within Christian typology**, Jesus’s death and resurrection is sometimes seen as an overarching “two-in-one” fulfillment:  
     - The “goat of sacrifice” = Jesus dying on the cross.  
     - The “scapegoat” = The consequence that the sin is removed completely, culminating in the resurrection (He “lives”).  

3. **Pilate as a Priest-Figure?**  
   - Pilate is a Roman governor, not a Jewish high priest. Christian exegesis typically sees Pilate not as reenacting a Levitical ceremony, but as the secular authority who condemns Jesus under pressure from the crowds and the Jewish leadership.  
   - Your reading is symbolic/typological, so it is not impossible to see a sign or type, but it is definitely a minority, non-literal interpretation.

---

## 3. Ezekiel 12 and the “Prince” Who Bears a Burden

### Ezekiel 12 in Its Historical Context

- **Ezekiel’s “Exile Symbol-Act”**: Ezekiel 12 recounts God instructing Ezekiel (addressed as “Son of Man”) to enact a drama of packing exile-baggage and digging through the wall to go out under cover of darkness.  
- **Historical Fulfillment**: Many interpreters see this sign-act directed against Judah’s leadership in the days just before (or during) the Babylonian siege (6th century BCE). Ezekiel was dramatizing how the “prince” (often identified with King Zedekiah) would try to flee the city by night, but ultimately be captured.  

### Your Reading (Ezekiel 12 as Messianic/Christological)

- You link Ezekiel’s sign-act to Jesus’s “secret” departure and the scattering of His disciples (“all of you will fall away,” Mark 14:27; cf. Zech 13:7). You also note Jesus’s self-reference as “Son of Man,” seeing a direct parallel to Ezekiel repeatedly called “Son of Man.”  
- You further connect the “burden on his shoulder” to the cross, the “scattering” of disciples, and a hidden exodus or “escape” reminiscent of the scapegoat being led out.  

#### Observations

1. **Son of Man in Ezekiel vs. Jesus**  
   - Ezekiel: “Son of Man” is a prophetic title used by God to address Ezekiel repeatedly (over 90 times), emphasizing his humanity contrasted with God’s glory.  
   - Gospels: “Son of Man” is Jesus’s preferred self-designation. Scholarly debates revolve around whether it is a claim to be the apocalyptic figure from Daniel 7:13–14 or simply a humble way of saying “I, as a human.”  

2. **Messianic Reading of Ezekiel**  
   - It is not uncommon in Christian tradition to see partial or typological references to Christ in many prophets, including Ezekiel. However, mainstream Christian interpretation typically sees Ezekiel 12 as either historically referencing Zedekiah’s attempt to flee Jerusalem, or as a more immediate sign of coming judgment.  
   - Your reading sees it as a direct prophecy of the Messiah’s secret departure. This is creative but not widely embraced in standard commentaries.  

3. **“Prince David” Language in Ezekiel**  
   - Later in Ezekiel (e.g., Ezek 34:23–24; 37:24–25), God speaks of raising up “my servant David” as a shepherd and prince. Christians commonly read those chapters as eschatological, messianic references to Jesus as the Davidic King. But Ezekiel 12 specifically references the rebellion in the land at that time.  

---

## 4. Symbols at the Crucifixion Matching Leviticus 14’s House-Cleansing

You note a series of parallels:

1. **Blood and Water (John 19:34)**: The soldier pierces Jesus’s side, and “blood and water” flow out. In Leviticus 14, the priest uses “living (running) water” mixed with blood from the bird.  
2. **Hyssop**: In John 19:29, a sponge of sour wine is lifted to Jesus on a hyssop branch. In Leviticus 14, hyssop is used in the cleansing ritual.  
3. **Cedar Wood**: The cross is made of wood; Leviticus 14 prescribes the use of cedar wood.  
4. **Scarlet Cloth**: Jesus is arrayed in a “scarlet” or “purple” robe (Matt 27:28; Mark 15:17; John 19:2). Leviticus 14 mentions scarlet yarn as part of the ritual.

**Typical Christian Interpretation** is that John especially frames the crucifixion as a Passover/Temple sacrificial motif (e.g., hyssop also used at Passover in Exodus 12:22). **You** see it as further proof that the crucifixion scene is the second “house cleansing” ritual (i.e., the Temple is the afflicted house in Leviticus 14). But you also incorporate the twist that Jesus, as scapegoat, must live; thus, in your view, the actual crucified figure is effectively the other “goat.”

---

## 5. Divergence from Mainstream Christian Theology

- **Traditional Christian Doctrine**:  
  1. Jesus died on the cross and was bodily resurrected on the third day.  
  2. Jesus’s sacrifice is the atoning event fulfilling both the sin-offering goat and scapegoat.  
  3. The Temple’s destruction in 70 CE is seen as God’s judgment on unbelieving Israel (e.g., Luke 19:41–44), but it does not imply that Jesus escaped death.  
  4. Paul’s theology of the cross and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15; Romans 5–6) is foundational to Christianity.

- **Your Reconstruction**:  
  1. Jesus is the scapegoat who must be set free.  
  2. Another prisoner is actually crucified.  
  3. This event parallels certain **Islamic** traditions in which Jesus was not truly killed but someone else died in his place (often associated with Surah 4:157 in the Qur’an).  
  4. You see the destruction of the Temple (and the tie to Leviticus 14) as confirming that the “house” was never truly cleansed—hence a second destruction was required, matching the instructions to demolish a persistently infected house.

Because your view rests on a literal scapegoat meaning “the living goat must remain alive,” you must posit that the Jesus of the Gospels was not the one who died on the cross. This is diametrically at odds with all four canonical Gospels’ Passion narratives and with the very core of Christian faith (i.e., “Christ crucified,” 1 Cor 1:23). Even so, it aligns with **docetic** or **substitution** theories that have occasionally appeared in various heterodox sects and in Islam.

---

## 6. Concluding Observations

1. **Typological Readings**:  
   - It is quite common in both Judaism and Christianity to read Leviticus 14’s diseased house as an allegory for the community or the Temple. In Christian circles, making the “house” a type for the Temple’s fate and using the cleansing ritual as a prefigurement of Jesus’s passion events is not unheard of.  
   - The presence of blood, water, hyssop, scarlet, and wood in John’s crucifixion narrative has long inspired typological parallels with Passover (Exodus 12), the Red Heifer (Numbers 19), and yes, Leviticus 14’s purification rites.

2. **Ezekiel 12’s “Prince”**:  
   - Standard exegesis sees the “prince” who tries to escape as King Zedekiah, but a messianic application can be made homiletically. You are free to notice patterns or “types” in Scripture that echo Christ’s life. However, this is well outside the mainstream reading.

3. **Whether Jesus Actually Died**:  
   - All canonical Christian writings, plus almost all early extra-canonical writings, affirm Jesus’s crucifixion and death. Even non-Christian historians (Josephus, Tacitus) note Jesus’s crucifixion under Pontius Pilate.  
   - Your perspective that Jesus merely enacted the scapegoat ritual but was not the one crucified—and thereby lives—has strong affinities to certain Islamic or Gnostic-Docetic positions. It is not recognized in mainstream Christian tradition.

4. **Weight of Tradition**:  
   - From the earliest Christian confessions (1 Corinthians 15:3–5) to modern statements of faith, the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central. This is deeply tied to how atonement is understood: “Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures” (1 Cor 15:3).

---

### In Sum

Your interpretation creates a tapestry of **Leviticus 14**, **Leviticus 16**, **Ezekiel 12**, and the **Gospel narratives**, concluding that:

- The “afflicted house” is the Temple—destroyed twice, indicating unremedied defilement.  
- Jesus is the scapegoat who must live to bear away sin, implying that someone else actually died on the cross.  
- Ezekiel’s sign-act of the prince going out secretly by night mirrors Jesus’s final hours, calling himself the “Son of Man,” with his disciples scattered.

While this reading does tie together various scriptural motifs in an intriguing symbolic way, it departs significantly from classical Christian teaching (and from the plain-sense reading of all four Gospels). It resonates more with non-mainstream or alternative theological traditions (particularly that part of Islamic tradition which denies the crucifixion of Jesus).

For those who see Jesus as both goats—*and* the fulfillment of the entire sacrificial system—His death and resurrection are a unified atoning act. But if one insists that the scapegoat must remain alive in the strict sense, then one either must adopt a two-in-one reading (as mainstream Christians do) or, as you propose, literally have Jesus “escape” crucifixion. That second conclusion, while it has supporters in certain circles, clearly conflicts with centuries of established Christian witness and doctrine.

Nonetheless, as a comparative or typological argument, it is always illuminating to see how the themes of **blood, water, purification, scapegoat, and temple destruction** can connect the Torah, the Prophets, and the Gospels. Even if most readers reject your specific conclusion (that Jesus himself did not die), your reading highlights rich symbolic overlap that is certainly worth deeper study and reflection.

you said "But if one insists that the scapegoat must remain alive in the strict sense, then one either must adopt a two-in-one reading (as mainstream Christians do) or, as you propose, literally have Jesus “escape” crucifixion". Thats the point, using Logic or logos. We know that Paul is the false prophet and author of the crucifixion doctrine. His letters taught this, but not Jesus followers in the Church at Jerusalem. Resurrection is a stumbling block as Paul intended. Mark the first Gospel originally had no resurrected Jesus. Matthew and Luke were copied from this so they also have no further weight to add. John contradicts all these accounts. Therefore there is no clear or obvious answer, only the prevailing beliefs as promoted by the writings of Paul. Thus Paul is the one Moses warns about. we are aware of mainstream views but prefer to use tools to examine our own ideas not compare to mainstream.

**Assessing the origins**

I’m piecing together the user's opinion that Paul is dubbed a "false prophet" with resurrection doctrine from critics who dive into Gnostic or Islamic viewpoints.

**Piecing together the evidence**

Addressing textual criticism and Mark's abrupt ending, I’m showing that the absence of resurrection doesn’t indicate its nonexistence, and respecting the user's preference for independent analysis.

**Navigating diverse views**

I’m noting the user's non-mainstream stance and providing a balanced analysis, including speculative points and historical controversies, to highlight the diverse perspectives in early Jesus communities.

---

Below is a discussion that focuses on **textual, historical, and logical considerations**—stepping outside of mainstream tradition as much as possible—to examine your perspective that Paul introduced (or heavily amplified) the doctrine of a crucified-and-resurrected Jesus, contrary to the earlier, original followers of Jesus. I will avoid simply reiterating standard church doctrine, instead spotlighting critical arguments, textual issues, and possible historical scenarios that people raise in favor of your viewpoint (and also where questions remain).

---

## 1. The Claim: Paul as a “False Prophet” Who Taught Crucifixion Doctrine

### 1.1. Pauline Epistles as Earliest Christian Writings
- **Dating**: Paul’s letters (Galatians, 1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, Philippians, Romans, etc.) are generally dated to the 50s–60s CE, making them earlier than the canonical Gospels (which most scholars date 70–100+ CE).
- **Crucifixion & Resurrection Emphasis**: In 1 Corinthians 15:1–4, Paul claims the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are “of first importance.” This is the backbone of his teaching and mission.
- **Conflict with Other Jesus-Followers?**  
  - Galatians 1–2 mentions Paul confronting Cephas (Peter) and James’s associates. There is tension regarding observance of the Law, table fellowship with Gentiles, etc.  
  - Acts of the Apostles (written later, likely 80s–90s CE) tries to harmonize Paul with the Jerusalem church, but it also preserves stories of conflict (Acts 15 “Council of Jerusalem,” etc.).

#### Your Position
You argue that Paul fundamentally *invented* or *distorted* the idea that Jesus actually died on the cross as an atoning sacrifice. In your reading, the earlier (Jerusalem) followers of Jesus did not hold that view; they might have believed Jesus escaped or was not crucified at all, or that he was the scapegoat who lives.

---

## 2. The Gospel of Mark and Its Abrupt Ending

### 2.1. The Earliest Manuscript Evidence
- The oldest manuscripts of Mark end at **16:8**, with the women fleeing from the empty tomb in fear and telling no one. Verses 16:9–20 (the so-called “Longer Ending of Mark”) are absent from the oldest Greek manuscripts. A shorter extra ending also appears in some manuscripts.  
- The abrupt ending at 16:8 has generated immense debate:  
  - Some argue it was *intentionally* abrupt, leaving the reader to ponder the empty tomb.  
  - Others say the original ending might have been lost.  
  - But in any case, the earliest Markan tradition ends without recording an appearance of the risen Jesus in Galilee or Jerusalem.

### 2.2. Did Mark Teach a Bodily Resurrection?
- Even ending at 16:8, Mark does mention an empty tomb and an angelic figure telling the women Jesus has been raised (16:6). Whether the narrative originally continued or not, it *does* reference resurrection—even if no post-resurrection appearances are narrated.
- Some interpret Mark as the earliest “story” consistent with Paul’s teaching—i.e., *some kind* of resurrection occurred. Others see Mark’s silence about appearances as potentially pointing to a different tradition or an incomplete text.

#### Your Position
You emphasize that *in its original form* Mark “had no resurrected Jesus” (i.e., no direct appearances). You might see the empty tomb as inconclusive evidence or a later interpolation, reading the abrupt ending as a strong clue that Mark did not originally support the full-blown resurrection narrative that Paul promoted. You may also propose that the “young man” at the tomb and the entire passage from 16:1–8 are open to multiple interpretations—not necessarily a bodily resurrection.

---

## 3. Matthew, Luke, and John—Contradictions and Additions

### 3.1. Dependence on Mark
- It is widely accepted by many scholars that **Matthew** and **Luke** both used Mark as a primary source (along with another hypothetical source “Q,” plus their own unique materials). They each expand or modify Mark’s resurrection story:
  - **Matthew 28** includes a dramatic scene with an earthquake and an angel rolling away the stone, then multiple resurrection appearances.  
  - **Luke 24** includes the Emmaus road story and a resurrection appearance in Jerusalem.
- If one sees Mark 16:8 as the earliest ending, then Matthew and Luke definitely add significant new material to shape the post-resurrection narrative.

### 3.2. The Gospel of John
- **John** has a very different style and sequence of events. John 20–21 features the “beloved disciple” outrunning Peter to the tomb, appearances to Mary Magdalene, Thomas, etc.  
- It is often considered the latest canonical Gospel, with its own theological agenda and high Christology.

#### Contradictions
- Between the Gospels, one sees conflicting details: who arrives at the tomb, how many angels, the precise location of appearances, who sees Jesus first, and so on.
- You point out that John “contradicts” the Synoptics in many ways—chronology, theology, etc. From your perspective, these contradictions cast doubt on a single unified crucifixion-resurrection narrative.

---

## 4. Did the Jerusalem Church Reject Crucifixion/Resurrection?

### 4.1. Historical Hints
- **Acts 21** describes James (the leader of the Jerusalem community) as “zealous for the Law.” Paul is asked to prove his fidelity to Torah by participating in purification rites in the Temple.  
- Early, extra-biblical sources (like the *Epistle of James* and *Didache*) are very Torah-positive, focusing on moral teaching rather than the theology of crucifixion.
- Some hypothesize that the Jerusalem church’s emphasis was on Jesus’s teachings (moral, eschatological) and fidelity to the Law, not on a cosmic redemption through his death. Paul’s letters, in contrast, revolve around the crucifixion/resurrection event as central.

### 4.2. Ebionites, Nazarenes, and Other Early Jewish Sects
- Later patristic writings mention **Ebionites** or certain “Jewish-Christian” sects that revered Jesus as Messiah but denied or minimized his divine nature and/or atoning death. Some accepted only parts of Matthew (often in a Hebrew/Aramaic version) and strongly rejected Paul.  
- These groups might reflect an older tradition that was overshadowed once Paul’s theology spread in the Gentile world.

#### Your Perspective
You’d argue that these Jewish believers represent a purer legacy of the historical Jesus and his earliest disciples (like James), a lineage untainted by Paul’s “false prophet” theology of crucifixion and resurrection. Paul’s writings, being widely circulated and eventually canonized, overshadowed (and effectively suppressed) the older viewpoint.

---

## 5. Moses’s Warning: “Another Prophet” Leading Astray?

### 5.1. Deuteronomy 13 and 18
- Deuteronomy 13:1–5 warns Israel not to follow a prophet who leads them away from God’s commandments.  
- Deuteronomy 18:20–22 says a prophet speaking falsely in Yahweh’s name will die.
- One might apply these passages to any teacher who appears to abrogate the Torah. Paul, in your view, taught that the law was superseded (Gal 3:23–25; Romans 7–8), thereby fulfilling the description of a “false prophet” leading people astray.

### 5.2. Convergence with Your Argument
You align Paul’s radical gentile-focused, law-free gospel (Gal 5:2–4; 1 Cor 9:20–21) with precisely what Moses forbade: abandoning the commandments of the Torah. Therefore, from the vantage of a Torah-faithful stance, Paul’s message about crucifixion/resurrection atonement also functions as an unbiblical invention.

---

## 6. The Logic of the “Scapegoat Must Live”

### 6.1. Levitical Ritual and Your Interpretation
- **Leviticus 16**: One goat is sacrificed, the other is sent away alive. You maintain that Jesus, if truly the scapegoat, must remain alive physically (released into the wilderness).  
- If the Gospels claim Jesus *died*, then either:
  1. They combine both goats in a single figure (the mainstream Christian approach).  
  2. Or those Gospel narratives are Paul-influenced expansions/edits, overshadowing the earlier tradition in which Jesus “escaped” death (your stance).

### 6.2. The Problem of Canonical Consistency
- The official canonical Gospels collectively affirm Jesus’s crucifixion and death. But if one rejects (a) Paul’s letters and (b) the final canonical form of the Gospels as late, edited texts, then one can hypothesize an original story in which Jesus is never actually killed—an idea that reemerges in certain **Islamic** interpretations (Qur’an 4:157).

---

## 7. Conclusion: No Single “Obvious” Answer If We Step Outside Mainstream

You state:
> “There is no clear or obvious answer, only the prevailing beliefs as promoted by the writings of Paul. Thus Paul is the one Moses warns about. We are aware of mainstream views but prefer to use tools to examine our own ideas, not compare to mainstream.”

### 7.1. Points That Support Your View

1. **Earliest Manuscripts of Mark** do not show a full post-resurrection appearance.  
2. **Paul’s Letters** are the earliest Christian documents we have; they heavily emphasize crucifixion and resurrection, which might reflect Paul’s unique theology rather than the earliest Jerusalem church.  
3. **Divergent Gospel Accounts** of the Passion and Resurrection exist, highlighting contradictions or later redactions.  
4. **Ebionite/Jewish-Christian Groups** in the early centuries appear to have had a different theology from Paul, possibly denying a literal crucifixion/resurrection, or at least not centralizing it.  
5. **Deuteronomy’s Warning** about false prophets leading people away from strict Torah observance could point to Paul’s law-free gospel as suspect.

### 7.2. Points Where Questions Remain

1. **Historical Evidence**: Even non-Christian sources (Josephus, Tacitus) suggest Jesus was crucified under Pilate. If we reject all these as inaccurate or corrupted, we must supply a plausible alternative historical path.  
2. **Why the Jerusalem Church Did Not Counter Paul Publicly** (at least in widespread surviving documents) if indeed they disagreed so starkly about the crucifixion. Acts (a pro-Paul source) tries to unify them, but the letters only hint at major disputes about the Law—**not** specifically about whether Jesus died.  
3. **Manuscript Tradition**: If the original Mark ended with no resurrection, it still alludes to Jesus being “raised.” That concept, even if ambiguous, could be an early tradition. It’s less direct, but it doesn’t straightforwardly confirm that Jesus “escaped.”  
4. **Variety in Early Christianities**: While there is likely more diversity in the first century than mainstream tradition admits, the notion of a completely non-crucified Jesus within the earliest Jesus movement is still speculative. Scholarly reconstructions range widely.

---

## Final Thoughts

Stepping outside the mainstream **does** open interpretive space. Early Jesus movements were not monolithic, and it is conceivable that Paul’s theological articulation overshadowed or even replaced certain earlier beliefs—particularly on the Law, the Gentile mission, and the significance of Jesus’s death. If you see that overshadowing as evidence of a “false prophet” scenario, you can line up Deuteronomy 13 and your scapegoat argument to assert that Paul originated a crucifixion-resurrection doctrine which was not authentically from Jesus’s own teaching.

In the end:

- **Mainstream Christianity** (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) is indeed Pauline at its core, emphasizing “Christ crucified and risen.”  
- **You** emphasize an alternate lineage: perhaps James, the Jerusalem church, and related Jewish-Christian sects that were overshadowed. You interpret the earliest version of Mark and certain textual hints as supporting a scenario where Jesus was never actually killed on the cross.  

Because the historical record is fragmentary and textual transmission is complex, there is no single, foolproof piece of evidence that compels everyone to the same conclusion. Your viewpoint underscores real textual issues, historical conflicts, and theological diversities in early Christianity. If your starting premise is that Paul is a “false prophet,” then yes—logically, you will read the Gospels and other documents through that lens, finding alternative meanings that fit your mosaic of Leviticus, Ezekiel, and the scapegoat theme.

Ultimately, whether someone adopts your position or a more standard Christian view comes down to **which texts and interpretive frames** they prioritize. A purely historical-critical approach cannot “prove” with certainty that the crucifixion as Paul taught it did not happen, nor can it absolutely confirm it. Each interpreter must decide how to weigh the evidence and the theological ramifications. 

But from a **logic/“logos”** standpoint, you have laid out a **cohesive**—albeit minority—reading: Jesus as scapegoat *must* live, Paul introduced the crucifixion doctrine, and the earliest textual witnesses can be read in ways that do not strictly mandate a historical death. That framework, while not conventional, follows its own internal consistency once one starts with distrust of the Pauline corpus and the final forms of the Gospel narratives.

---

yes but Lev 14 is a reflection of Leviticus 16 as well as the crucifixion, reiterating that the cleansing is about the animal who is set free carry away the uncleanness. Its repeated so you cant say you missed it if one is diligent with the law.  add Deut 13 and 18 warnings. Add Ezekiel 12  (and 34:24) and 13. You see then that Jesus purposed to 'cleanse' the temple with the act of "the son of man" knowing that this is what must come.  KNowing also that they would be led astray by the ravenous wolf  (false prophet) of Benjamin (Paul), deescribed in Ezekiel 13 with lying visions.

**Connecting biblical scriptures**

I'm tasked with linking Leviticus 14, 16; Deuteronomy 13, 18; Ezekiel 12, 34:24 to Paul, a false prophet, and showing Jesus's cleansing act as the Son of Man. Integrative commentary is needed to illustrate these connections.

**Tracing allegories**

Pulling together themes of cleansing animals in Leviticus and comparing them to Paul's role as a false prophet. Drawing Ezekiel's visions into this juxtaposition clarifies their significance.

**Connecting philosophical insights**

Mapping out Paul's teachings to ancient prophecies and Jesus' acts, a cohesive commentary that educates and clarifies.

**Unveiling prophetic insights**

Ezekiel's prophecies point to Paul as a false prophet, using vivid imagery like "wolf in sheep's clothing" and the tribe of Benjamin, paralleling Paul's deceitful tactics.

**Piecing together**

Connecting Ezekiel 34:24 to Jesus as the Messiah and paralleling Paul's origins with the tribe of Benjamin to the "ravenous wolf" imagery.

Below is a **combined overview** of how these various Torah and prophetic passages (Leviticus 14, Leviticus 16, Deuteronomy 13 & 18, Ezekiel 12, 13, and 34:24) can be read as pointing to **Jesus’s temple-cleansing mission**—while also **warning** against the eventual “false prophet” (identified as Paul, the “ravenous wolf from Benjamin”):

## 1. Leviticus 14 & 16: The House-Cleansing and the Scapegoat

1. **Leviticus 14: Diseased House**
   - A house showing signs of “infection” (often understood as mold or mildew) is inspected by the priest.  
   - First, the afflicted stones are removed and replaced. If the infection returns, the entire house must be demolished.  
   - If the house is declared pure, a *double-bird* ritual is performed with blood, “running water,” hyssop, cedar, and scarlet yarn—culminating in one bird sacrificed, the other set free.

2. **Leviticus 16: Day of Atonement (Two Goats)**
   - One goat is sacrificed; the other (the scapegoat) remains alive, carrying away the people’s sins into the wilderness.  
   - **Key Point**: The scapegoat must live to fulfill its role of removing sin/impurity from the community.

3. **Connection to Jesus’s “Temple Cleansing”**
   - Jesus, by driving out defilement (the “plague of wickedness”) from the Temple, attempts the Levitical “first step” of cleansing.  
   - When the Temple remains spiritually polluted, it points to total destruction—“not one stone left upon another.”  
   - The repeated mention in both **Leviticus 14** (house-cleansing) and **Leviticus 16** (scapegoat) stresses that the *living* creature carries uncleanness away. This leads to the argument that Jesus, as the *true* scapegoat, **must survive** rather than die.

## 2. Deuteronomy 13 & 18: Warnings About False Prophets

1. **Deuteronomy 13:1–5**
   - If a “prophet” or “dreamer of dreams” leads you away from Torah, do not follow them—even if their signs or wonders seem impressive.  
   - Such a prophet is considered a false guide, luring Israel into disobedience.

2. **Deuteronomy 18:20–22**
   - Another warning: a so-called prophet who speaks falsely in Yahweh’s name will be judged by God.  
   - Israel must be on guard against those who proclaim a message contrary to God’s commands.

3. **Application to Paul as the “False Prophet”**
   - From this viewpoint, anyone who teaches a new or law-superseding message (like Paul’s “freedom from the Law”) falls under Moses’s curse.  
   - Paul is from the tribe of **Benjamin**, associated (in Genesis 49:27) with a “ravenous wolf.”  
   - Therefore, Paul’s theology (especially the crucifixion doctrine and “law-free” gospel) is seen as the very deception these Deuteronomic passages forewarn.

## 3. Ezekiel 12, 13, and 34:24—The “Son of Man,” Cleansing Sign-Acts, and the False Prophets

### 3.1. Ezekiel 12: The Sign-Act of the “Son of Man”  
- Ezekiel, repeatedly called “son of man,” enacts a drama of packing baggage and going out by night through a hole in the wall.  
- Many interpret this historically as a warning to Judah’s leadership (e.g., King Zedekiah).  
- **Alternative (Christ-centered) Reading**:  
  - Jesus calls Himself “Son of Man.”  
  - The burdensome act of sneaking out at night aligns with Jesus’s final hours, the scattering of His disciples, and a “secret” departure (or “escape”) under cover of darkness.  
  - It foreshadows how the temple/house will be judged, just as Ezekiel portrayed.

### 3.2. Ezekiel 13: Condemnation of False Prophets with “Lying Visions”  
- Ezekiel 13 rails against prophets who utter deceptive messages, whitewashing walls that are doomed to collapse.  
- **Connection to Paul**:  
  - If Paul’s crucifixion-resurrection doctrine is seen as an innovation or “lying vision,” then Ezekiel 13’s denunciation of false prophets and worthless plaster parallels Paul’s role.  
  - The mention of a “wall” repeatedly plastered but destined to fall resonates with the Temple that is destroyed due to ongoing defilement.

### 3.3. Ezekiel 34:24: “My Servant David … Will Be Prince Among Them”  
- Ezekiel foresees a future figure—God’s appointed “Davidic” prince—who shepherds Israel in truth.  
- **Jesus as the Davidic Prince**:  
  - Ties in with the Gospels’ portrayal of Jesus as “Son of David,” the rightful king.  
  - He performs the role of the faithful shepherd, in contrast to false prophets or corrupt leaders.

## 4. Putting It All Together

1. **Temple (the Diseased House) Must Be Cleansed**  
   - Leviticus 14 frames the steps to cleanse a persistent infection. After a partial attempt, if wickedness persists, the house is demolished. This happened historically in 70 CE.  
   - Jesus enacts the initial “cleansing” (driving out money-changers), but sees that the corruption remains—thus prophesying the Temple’s total destruction.

2. **Jesus as the “Scapegoat” Must Live**  
   - Leviticus 16 underlines that *one* goat is slain, while the scapegoat is released *alive* to carry away the impurity.  
   - If Jesus is the scapegoat, the logic (from this standpoint) demands He cannot be the goat who dies. Hence the idea that **He escaped actual crucifixion**—someone else was crucified.  

3. **Warnings Against a New, Contradictory Doctrine**  
   - Deuteronomy 13 & 18 caution about following a prophet who leads away from Torah.  
   - Ezekiel 13 prophesies about “lying visions.”  
   - From this vantage, Paul introduces a theology that replaces the Torah-based approach to atonement with “Christ crucified,” urging Gentiles (and Jews) to abandon full Torah observance.  
   - Thus, Paul is labeled the “false prophet” or “ravenous wolf of Benjamin.”

4. **Ezekiel’s Sign-Acts Point to the Son of Man Cleansing**  
   - Ezekiel 12’s “son of man” sign-act is mirrored by Jesus, also calling Himself “Son of Man,” indicating a deeper fulfillment.  
   - He shoulders the burden (the cross), departs under cover of darkness (Gethsemane arrest, overnight trials), and His followers scatter.

5. **Result**: The House (Temple) Falls, Many Are Led Astray  
   - Jesus’s true mission (to cleanse and bring the people back to God in a Torah-consistent way) is overshadowed by a deceptive message.  
   - The second Temple destruction (70 CE) confirms the House was never truly purified under Paul’s version of events.  
   - Meanwhile, those loyal to the original Mosaic lens would see Paul’s crucifixion-resurrection teaching as the *false prophecy* Moses had warned about.

## Final Synthesis

- **Leviticus 14 and 16** repeatedly emphasize the principle of atonement through rituals involving *both* blood and a *living* carrier of sin/impurity.  
- **Deuteronomy 13 & 18** foretell the rise of false prophets, urging Israel not to abandon God’s commandments.  
- **Ezekiel 12, 13, 34:24** (plus the broader context of Ezekiel) depict the “Son of Man” performing sign-acts of judgment, calling out false prophets, and heralding a future Davidic leader/prince.  
- **Jesus** consciously fulfills Ezekiel’s role as “Son of Man,” aiming to purify the Temple (the diseased “house”) and call Israel back to true fidelity.  
- Knowing the outcome, He anticipates both the Temple’s destruction and the rise of a “ravenous wolf” from Benjamin—identified with Paul—who teaches a contradictory message and leads many astray.  
- In this view, the genuine atonement requires the “scapegoat” to remain alive (carrying sin away), so Jesus is not truly the one killed. Paul’s theology of the crucifixion-resurrection is interpreted as precisely the false prophecy Deuteronomy and Ezekiel warned about.

This unified reading uses **Torah ordinances (Lev 14, 16), prophetic warnings (Deut 13, 18), Ezekiel’s son-of-man sign-acts (Ezek 12, 13, 34)** to argue that Jesus deliberately took on the role of cleansing the Temple and acting as the scapegoat—while also foreseeing that a deceptive movement (led by Paul) would overshadow this truth.
