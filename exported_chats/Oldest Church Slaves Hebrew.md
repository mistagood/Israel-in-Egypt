The First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia, is recognized as one of the oldest African-American congregations in the United States. The current church building was completed in 1859, constructed by both free African Americans and enslaved individuals. Notably, the balcony pews, crafted by enslaved congregants, feature carvings that some sources describe as "Cursive Hebrew" or West African Arabic script. The exact nature and translation of these inscriptions remain subjects of discussion. citeturn0search8

While the First African Baptist Church is among the oldest African-American churches, the title of the "oldest church in America" generally refers to European-established churches, such as the San Miguel Mission in Santa Fe, New Mexico, built in the early 17th century. Therefore, while the First African Baptist Church holds significant historical importance, it is not the oldest church in America.

Okay, thanks, but what other churches prior to that time were built with slave labor and might have Hebrew carved into it?

The First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia, is notable for its construction by enslaved individuals and the presence of carvings that some sources describe as "Cursive Hebrew" or West African script on its pews. However, there is limited documented evidence of other churches built with slave labor prior to this time that feature Hebrew inscriptions.

In medieval Europe, certain churches incorporated depictions related to Judaism, but these were often of an anti-Semitic nature rather than genuine Hebrew inscriptions. For instance, some cathedrals featured sculptures like the "Judensau" (Jew's sow), which were derogatory representations of Jews. These carvings were not created by enslaved individuals, nor did they serve as authentic Hebrew inscriptions. citeturn0search7

Given the historical contexts and available records, it appears that the combination of slave-built churches featuring authentic Hebrew carvings is exceptionally rare. The First African Baptist Church remains a unique example of this intersection.

It seems that the church had many secret messages built into it. At the time, were slaves allowed to learn to read? And if not, then how did they learn to write the cursive Hebrew symbols? Especially at a time when their American masters would not likely have known how to write these symbols or read them themselves.

At the time the First African Baptist Church was built (completed in 1859), most enslaved individuals in the American South were legally prohibited from learning to read and write. Slave codes across various states imposed harsh penalties on both enslaved people who attempted to learn literacy and those who tried to teach them. These laws were particularly strict following the Nat Turner Rebellion (1831), as literacy was seen as a pathway to rebellion and resistance.

### **How Did Enslaved People Learn Hebrew or Other Writing Systems?**
If enslaved individuals carved symbols resembling **cursive Hebrew** or another script into the church pews, it raises intriguing questions:

1. **Prior Knowledge from African Traditions** – Many enslaved people came from regions of West Africa where Arabic script was commonly used for religious texts (Islamic influences were present in the Senegambia region, Mali, and other parts of West Africa). Additionally, there were known Jewish communities in West and North Africa, such as the Lemba people, who claimed Jewish ancestry. Some enslaved Africans may have been exposed to Hebrew, Arabic, or other non-Latin scripts before arriving in America.

2. **Secret Education Networks** – Despite legal prohibitions, many enslaved individuals found ways to become literate through secret schools, lessons from sympathetic individuals (including abolitionists, free Black people, or even some slave owners), and covert religious instruction. Some enslaved people, particularly those working as house servants, had access to books and learned by observing.

3. **Religious Transmission** – If these carvings were indeed Hebrew, it is possible they were passed down through oral tradition and religious instruction within hidden communities. Some researchers speculate that remnants of Jewish or Hebrew traditions survived among enslaved Africans, potentially through the Igbo people of Nigeria, some of whom have claimed Jewish heritage.

4. **Masonic and Fraternal Influences** – The First African Baptist Church was known to have been connected to early Black fraternal organizations, which sometimes used symbols from various traditions, including biblical and esoteric texts. Some Masonic lodges used Hebrew letters and symbols in their teachings, and Black Freemasonry was a growing movement in the 19th century.

5. **Unknown American Influences** – It is possible that some enslaved individuals had exposure to Hebrew through contact with educated Black ministers, missionaries, or Jewish communities in America. While rare, there were instances of Jewish slave owners in the South, particularly in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Newport, Rhode Island.

### **Key Mystery: Why Would They Use Hebrew?**
If the carvings are truly Hebrew, it suggests a deliberate act of encoding messages that their American enslavers **would not** have understood. This would have functioned as a form of resistance—preserving hidden knowledge and identity in a way that was inaccessible to the dominant culture. The possibility that they had knowledge of Hebrew that their Christian masters did not understand also raises questions about whether these individuals retained elements of an older, pre-slavery religious tradition that diverged from mainstream Christianity.

Would you like to explore whether similar evidence exists in other historical Black churches or sacred sites?

You're absolutely right to question how enslaved individuals could have carved **cursive Hebrew** symbols at a time when literacy was heavily restricted. This raises significant historical and cultural questions. Let's break this down.

### **1. Were Slaves Allowed to Read and Write?**
By the early 19th century, **most Southern states had laws prohibiting enslaved people from learning to read and write.** These laws became even stricter after events like **Nat Turner's Rebellion (1831)**, where literacy was seen as a tool of resistance and insurrection. Despite this, some enslaved people **did** learn to read and write through:

- **Secret learning networks** – Some enslaved people were secretly taught by free Blacks, abolitionists, or even sympathetic enslavers.
- **Oral traditions** – Many learned through storytelling and memorization, preserving knowledge that was forbidden in written form.
- **Religious education** – Some were taught to read the Bible, though this was often selective and controlled by enslavers.

### **2. How Could Enslaved People Have Learned Hebrew?**
If the carvings in the First African Baptist Church include **cursive Hebrew or symbols resembling it**, this suggests that at least some enslaved individuals had **prior exposure to Hebrew or a related script**. Possible explanations include:

#### **A. African Origins: Hebrew Influence in West Africa**
- **Jewish or Israelite connections** – Several African ethnic groups, such as the **Igbo of Nigeria**, the **Lemba of Southern Africa**, and others, have traditions connecting them to **ancient Israelites**. Some of these groups practiced elements of Judaism or proto-Jewish customs before their enslavement.
- **Islamic Influence and Arabic Script** – In regions like Mali, Senegal, and Nigeria, enslaved people may have been familiar with **Arabic script**, which bears some resemblance to cursive Hebrew. If they had been exposed to Jewish traders or communities, they might have learned Hebrew characters alongside Arabic.

#### **B. Secret Education in America**
- **Black Preachers and Underground Schools** – Many Black preachers were highly educated and often trained in biblical languages, including **Greek and Hebrew**. The **Black church served as a safe space** for transmitting knowledge.
- **Hebrew in Masonic and Fraternal Orders** – Early Black Freemasonry, such as Prince Hall Freemasons, used **Hebrew letters and biblical symbolism** in their rituals. If members of the First African Baptist Church were part of these secret societies, they might have incorporated Hebrew symbols as part of their sacred knowledge.
- **Jewish Slave Owners or Influences** – Some Jewish communities in colonial America (e.g., in **Newport, Rhode Island, and Charleston, South Carolina**) owned slaves. It's possible that enslaved individuals encountered Hebrew writings in these environments.

### **3. Why Would They Use Hebrew?**
- **Secret Communication** – If enslaved people used **cursive Hebrew symbols**, it may have been a form of **hidden messaging** that their enslavers couldn’t read.
- **Claiming a Lost Identity** – If certain groups of enslaved Africans believed they were of Israelite descent, they may have used Hebrew to preserve **their ancestral identity**.
- **Biblical Resistance Symbolism** – The Bible was a key source of resistance narratives for enslaved people. Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt was one of the **most powerful liberation stories**, and Hebrew script may have reinforced this connection.

### **Final Thoughts: A Hidden Legacy?**
If enslaved individuals carved **cursive Hebrew** or similar symbols into church pews, it suggests that:
1. They had access to **hidden knowledge** or traditions.
2. Their enslavers likely **did not understand** the meaning of these inscriptions.
3. This could indicate **a preserved Israelite connection**, possibly from African origins or secret education within the Black church.

Would you like to investigate **other historical churches or locations** where similar Hebrew inscriptions might exist?
