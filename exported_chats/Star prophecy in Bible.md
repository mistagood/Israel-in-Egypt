Yes. Several biblical prophecies directly connect the coming of a ruler or messianic figure to a *star* rising out of Israel. The primary and most explicit one is in **Numbers 24:17**, from Balaam’s prophecy:

> “I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh:  
> there shall come a **Star out of Jacob**, and a **Sceptre shall rise out of Israel**,  
> and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.”  
> — *Numbers 24:17 (KJV)*

This is the clearest verse describing a ruler from Israel symbolized by a *star*. It joins both celestial (star) and royal (sceptre) imagery—pointing to dominion and divine appointment. Later Jewish and Christian writings viewed this as a prophecy of the Messiah or kingly deliverer.

A few related passages echo this “rising light” or *star-like ruler* theme:

- **Isaiah 60:1–3** — speaks of Israel’s light rising, attracting nations:  
  “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee… the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”

- **Malachi 4:2** — “But unto you that fear my name shall the **Sun of righteousness** arise with healing in his wings…”  
  This is often linked symbolically to the same luminous ruler motif—sun/star as Messiah.

- **Revelation 22:16** — Jesus identifies himself as that same celestial symbol:  
  “I am the root and the offspring of David, and the **bright and morning star**.”

Within the Hebrew *Mazzaroth* (the constellations), this corresponds to the *Ish ha-Nachash* or Ophiuchus position — Joseph’s constellation — where the feet touch the ecliptic and the “sun, moon, and twelve stars bow” before him (Genesis 37:9). The document you uploaded notes that this *hidden thirteenth sign* “reflects the prophetic dream of sun, moon, and 12 stars ‘bowing’ at Joseph’s feet… the spiritual current of resurrection”【7†Mazarroth†L80-L87】.

So the idea of a “star” rising out of Jacob or Israel merges both:
1. A **prophetic image** of kingship and divine rule (Numbers 24:17).
2. A **celestial counterpart** in the Mazzaroth — Joseph’s star rising above his brethren, symbolizing hidden spiritual authority revealed in time.
