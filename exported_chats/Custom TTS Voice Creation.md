# Custom TTS Voice Creation



---

open ai API has tts voices but I would like a different one. Is it possible to get/program a new one for use?

Yes, it is possible to create or use a different text-to-speech (TTS) voice for your applications instead of the default voices provided by OpenAI or other TTS providers. Here are several ways you can achieve this:

### 1. **Custom Voice Creation with Machine Learning:**
   - You can create a custom TTS voice using machine learning models. This involves training a TTS model using recordings of the desired voice. Companies like **Google Cloud, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft Azure** offer services to create custom TTS voices if you provide enough high-quality audio samples (typically hours of recordings).
   - You can also use open-source tools like **Mozilla TTS, Coqui TTS, or Tacotron 2** to train custom TTS models locally or in the cloud. However, this requires substantial computing resources and expertise in machine learning.

### 2. **Using Pre-Built TTS Voices from Other Providers:**
   - There are several TTS providers that offer unique voices not found in OpenAI’s offerings. Some popular TTS services are **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech, iSpeech, and Resemble.ai**. These platforms provide many high-quality voices in multiple languages and dialects.
   - Some services, like **Resemble.ai** and **Descript**, also allow for voice cloning, which can be customized and then used via APIs.

### 3. **Voice Cloning and Voice Modulation Tools:**
   - If you want a voice similar to a specific person or a unique style, you could use voice cloning tools like **Resemble.ai, Descript's Overdub, or ElevenLabs**. These tools allow for the creation of a synthetic voice clone by using a relatively small amount of recorded audio.
   - **Voice modulation software** can be used to alter existing TTS outputs to match a desired pitch, tone, or style.

### 4. **Integrating Custom TTS Voices in Your Application:**
   - Once you have created or chosen a custom TTS voice, you can integrate it with your application or platform using APIs. Most TTS providers have SDKs and APIs that you can easily call from your applications to convert text to speech using the custom voice.
   - If you are familiar with programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or others, you can use libraries like **pyttsx3** (Python) or **ResponsiveVoice** (JavaScript) to manage TTS functionalities and integrate different voices into your app.

### 5. **Using Docker for TTS Models:**
   - If you are looking to experiment or deploy a TTS model in a contained environment, Docker can be a great tool. You can pull pre-built Docker images of TTS models like **Mozilla TTS** and run them on your local or cloud servers. This allows for flexibility in terms of modifying and tuning the models to better suit your needs.

### Next Steps:
If you're interested in developing a custom voice or need help with specific tools or libraries, let me know. I can provide more detailed guidance on setting up environments, choosing the right tools, or programming the integration.

Currently, OpenAI's API does not support custom text-to-speech (TTS) voices directly. The TTS voices available through OpenAI's models are predefined, and OpenAI does not provide a built-in option for creating or importing custom voices within their API framework.

However, if you want to use a different TTS voice while still leveraging OpenAI's language models for generating text, you can combine OpenAI's text generation capabilities with another TTS service that supports custom voices. Here’s how you can achieve that:

### Combining OpenAI with Other TTS Services

1. **Use OpenAI for Text Generation:**
   - Use OpenAI’s API (like GPT-4) to generate text content. You can call the API to produce the text output you need.

2. **Send Generated Text to a Custom TTS Service:**
   - After generating text with OpenAI, send the text output to a TTS service that allows for custom voice creation. Services like **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, Microsoft Azure**, or **Resemble.ai** support custom voice integration through their own APIs.
   - You can set up a pipeline where the text generated by OpenAI is passed to these TTS services to produce speech with a custom voice.

### Potential Workflow

- **Step 1:** Use the OpenAI API to generate text content.
- **Step 2:** Pass the generated text to a custom TTS service API that supports custom voices.
- **Step 3:** Retrieve the audio output from the TTS service and use it in your application.

### Example Integration Using Python

```python
import openai
import requests

# Step 1: Generate text using OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-004",
  prompt="Generate some text",
  max_tokens=50
)
generated_text = response['choices'][0]['text']

# Step 2: Send text to a custom TTS service (e.g., Google Cloud TTS)
def generate_speech(text):
    tts_api_url = "https://custom-tts-service-url.com/convert"
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TTS_API_KEY'}
    data = {'text': text, 'voice': 'your_custom_voice_id'}
    response = requests.post(tts_api_url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.content

# Use the TTS service to generate audio from OpenAI's text output
audio = generate_speech(generated_text)

# Step 3: Save or use the audio output as needed
with open("output_audio.wav", "wb") as audio_file:
    audio_file.write(audio)
```

### Conclusion

While OpenAI does not natively support custom TTS voices, you can easily integrate its text generation capabilities with other TTS providers that allow for custom voice creation. If you're looking for specific instructions on setting up this kind of integration or need more details on any of the steps, feel free to ask!
