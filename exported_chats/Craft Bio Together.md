lets keep revising. I started this Journey when my son Nicky was diagnose with autism back in '03. Born in 2000 he was the first wave of the autism epidemic. Thesde were the ones who had poor early intervention due to systemic failure. This is the purpose of Nicky's House, to provide for them. This sent me on a journey to educate myself after facing abuse and civil suits with school districts when Nicky was young. The incidents laid the foundation for the hero's journey, the basis of the work. Understanding the gift of my son, we now help others to face their challenges and fair as well. With a goal of helping every family achieve success on their journey

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for your follow-up. It was a pleasure discussing the prospective sublease for Nicky's House earlier today. As outlined during our conversation, our organization is committed to creating a supportive and enriching environment for individuals with special needs. Below are the details regarding our intended use of the space:

**Activity Description:**  
Nicky's House will use the space primarily for therapeutic activities, educational programs, art creation, and staff training. Our programs are designed to foster skill development, therapeutic expression, and personal growth in a serene and controlled setting.

**Staff to Patient Ratio:**  
We adhere to a strict staff-to-patient ratio to ensure optimal care and attention for each individual. The ratio will not exceed one staff member to two clients at any given time, maintaining an intimate and focused setting.

**Number of People at a Time:**  
We anticipate accommodating no more than 15 individuals (inclusive of both staff and clients) simultaneously in the space. This ensures a conducive environment for our activities while managing the overall occupancy effectively.

**Potential Noise Level:**  
Given the nature of our activities, which include therapeutic sessions and art creation, the noise level will be minimal. Our environment is curated to be calming and conducive to our clients' well-being, minimizing any potential disturbances.

In addition to our core activities, the space will also serve as a venue for training our staff, ensuring they are well-equipped to provide the highest standard of care and support to our clients.

well we axtually need to make some noise

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for your follow-up. It was a pleasure discussing the prospective sublease for Nicky's House with you. To provide clarity on our intended use of the space, please find below the pertinent details:

**Activity Description:**  
Nicky's House plans to utilize the space for a blend of activities, including therapeutic sessions, educational programs, staff training, and notably, art creation workshops. These workshops, while enriching and therapeutic, may generate a moderate level of noise due to the nature of the artistic processes involved.

**Staff to Patient Ratio:**  
Our operations maintain a staff-to-client ratio ensuring personalized attention and care. Typically, this ratio does not exceed one staff member for every two clients, fostering a supportive and effective therapeutic environment.

**Number of People at a Time:**  
The space will accommodate up to 15 individuals at any given time, which includes both our dedicated staff and the clients we serve. This controlled number ensures effective management of the space while providing ample room for our activities.

**Potential Noise Level:**  
In the spirit of transparency, it's important to note that while our primary goal is to create a therapeutic and supportive environment, certain activities, especially our art creation workshops, are inherently more dynamic and may produce a level of noise. We are committed to managing this aspect responsibly, ensuring that any noise generated falls within acceptable levels and adheres to any guidelines or constraints you may have.

Nicky's House is dedicated to fostering an environment where individuals with special needs can explore their creativity, develop new skills, and express themselves. Our commitment to these goals is matched by our commitment to being considerate and responsible tenants, fully aware of our surroundings and community.

We are keen to work with you to address any concerns you might have about noise levels or other aspects of our activities and to find mutually agreeable solutions that allow us to fulfill our mission while respecting the property's ambiance and regulations.
