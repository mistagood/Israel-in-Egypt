# Human Symbolism in Narratives

In a creation narrative, it's crucial to understand that bbit's a master key to the process of manifestation that humans have. God created man and said, let us make man in our own image. Now in doing this, God created a garden and he made a man and he put the garden in it. Now we have to look at the language here very carefully because it says that he put the man in the garden that he created and in the garden he caused all of these plants to grow. And the language is very cryptic when he talks about the trees. It says, and in the midst, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. It doesn't say he also put the tree there, but the language is very cryptic as if some words were taken out or there's a hidden meaning. Well, we find that the language really points to the fact that the humans are the tree. We are the tree and we can be a tree of life or we can be a tree of knowledge of which is knowledge of good and evil. Now Jesus iterates this when he heals a man who's blind. The man opens his eyes and Jesus says, what do you see? He says, I see people walking around as trees. And so this story overlaps if we look closely with another story, because Jesus tells the man to not go back to the village after this, but to go somewhere else. Well, if we look at the other gospel, we see that this is actually the same story of Jesus healing the man. And then the man goes to the town anyway, and the people don't believe that he was blind before. And so these are two stories are connected. And so when Jesus tells the man not to go to the town, the man goes anyway and it starts a commotion. But what we find out in that story is that the man tells people that he's trying to convince people of something that they can't believe and what they really can't believe what's hidden here is that he has seen a secret. And so the fact is that they are the blind ones now because they can't see. So he says, now, here's the thing never has this happened before, but you guys can't see. And so you kick him out. So he's trying to explain to them the profound vision that he now has, and no one can understand it. They still can't see. And he's trying to bring them this good news. But they've rejected it because they can't see. So the true story here is that there's knowledge, which they had the the people had knowledge they had, but it was good and it was evil. It had two effects on them. One effect was that it made them blind to the truth because their knowledge blinded them. And so Jesus does begin to teach that if they had if they were blind, they would be able to see. But because they have sight, then that's the case. So the truth is that we have the choice to be the tree. We are the tree of life, but we're not to consume it, it can be consumed. And so what we do is we consume this and this has to do with processes, living out of balance with certain processes that have to do with the pineal gland and circadian rhythms and and lunar cycles, which has to do with the Sabbath day or the new moon, then the Sabbath is seven days following the new moon cycle, as the creation cycle is listed in Genesis. And so we see that Eve, a woman's body follows this cycle, and we can clearly see that her flesh reflects the cycle of a 28 day lunar cycle and is, of course, as the earth is 71% water, so are humans. And so the lunar cycles are also a flight affecting the waters within our bodies. And women reflect this with their cycles, men have cycles too. And so if we are to have cleansing periods, which a woman is seen to be unclean at a certain time because her body is cleansing out at that time, men also have cycles where these hormones are fluctuating because of the cycles of the moon and the effects on the pineal gland. Now these are the same as the natural cycles with trees, and with other plants on the earth, which sustain long life and live for a very long time, but it's a trade-off between growth and restoration versus regeneration, so it's self-regeneration versus fertilization.

In the creation narrative, understanding the language and symbolism reveals deeper truths about manifestation and the nature of humanity. God’s declaration, "Let us make man in our own image," sets the stage for the profound connection between divine creation and human existence. God creates a garden and places man within it, but the language becomes intriguing when it describes the presence of the "tree of life" and the "tree of knowledge of good and evil." The text does not explicitly say that God "placed" these trees there, suggesting an encrypted message or a missing piece of the narrative puzzle.

A closer examination reveals that the "trees" might actually symbolize humans. Humans are depicted as living trees with a choice—to embody the "tree of life" or to embody the "tree of knowledge of good and evil." This allegory resonates with Jesus' miracle of healing a blind man. When Jesus heals the man's blindness, the man describes seeing "people walking around like trees." This vision underscores the metaphorical representation of humans as trees—rooted in spiritual potential, either flourishing with life or tangled in the dualities of good and evil knowledge.

Interestingly, this miracle narrative unfolds across different gospel accounts, presenting varied outcomes for the healed man. In one account, Jesus instructs the healed man not to return to his village. Yet, in another telling, the man returns, creating disbelief among the villagers who cannot comprehend his transformation from blindness to sight. This dual narrative reveals a deeper lesson: the blindness of those who cannot see beyond their limited understanding of reality. The man attempts to share his newfound vision—the secret knowledge he has gained—but the villagers remain spiritually blind, unable to perceive the hidden truth he now embodies.

The essence of the message is that knowledge, though powerful, can blind those who consume it without discernment. The knowledge of good and evil, while expansive, can lead to spiritual blindness. Jesus emphasizes this paradox by stating that those who are blind could see if they recognized their blindness. In contrast, those who believe they see are often the most blind, unable to discern the profound mysteries of life.

Humans, therefore, stand at a crossroads as the living "tree." We possess the potential to embody life-giving qualities or to consume the dual knowledge that blinds us to higher truths. The act of "consuming" the tree refers to living out of alignment with natural processes, such as the rhythms of the pineal gland, circadian cycles, and lunar phases—all of which are intricately connected to spiritual and physical balance.

The cycles of the moon are particularly relevant to understanding this balance. Just as the Sabbath is aligned with lunar cycles—starting from the new moon and following a seven-day cycle—so too does the human body, especially the female body, reflect these lunar rhythms. A woman's menstrual cycle, mirroring the 28-day lunar cycle, aligns her with the cosmic ebb and flow, reflecting a deep connection between celestial bodies and human biology. Men, too, experience hormonal fluctuations influenced by these lunar cycles, though less visibly than women.

These natural cycles are akin to the regenerative processes found in trees and other plant life, which oscillate between phases of growth, restoration, and regeneration. This natural wisdom teaches that life is a balance between self-regeneration and external fertilization—between being rooted in one's essence and engaging with the world around.

The narrative, when viewed through this lens, transforms into an invitation to rediscover our nature as living trees. It calls for an alignment with the natural, divine cycles that govern all life, moving away from the blind consumption of knowledge that disconnects us from the tree of life within.
