This should help some. Deuteronomy 4:19
And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.  The Idea is that each of us belongs to a star family and the tribes of the sky mark our tribes. This is ancient and biblical. References and theory will be from the bible. Quoting passages  that indicate that people are 'patterned after the stars'. The tribes of Jacob are patterned after the sky. Abraham was told look at the stars, I will number your descendants according to them. They reflect a pattern and if you can 'number' the stars you can number his descendants. This hints at a relationship. As above so below. The esoteric teaching Jesus refered to what you bind on earth is bound in heaven... Likewise God says before I formed you in the womb I knew you. Rebecca had 2 warring peoples in her belly.Genesis 1:16
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

### Sample Chapter: Chapter 1 - The Origins of Antenatal Astrology

**Introduction to the Concept:**
Antenatal astrology is the practice of analyzing the position of transiting planets during an individual's gestation period to predict their future personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses. This concept, while seemingly modern, has deep roots in ancient and biblical traditions.

**Historical and Biblical Origins:**
Astrology, as a study of celestial bodies and their influence on human life, dates back to ancient civilizations. The Bible, a profound historical text, contains numerous references to the stars and their significance.

In Deuteronomy 4:19, it is written: "And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven." This passage highlights the ancient understanding of the stars' influence, cautioning against their worship but acknowledging their role in the divine order.

**The Tribes of the Sky:**
The concept of each individual belonging to a star family is echoed in biblical stories. The tribes of Jacob are often seen as patterned after the sky. God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 15:5 is a key example: "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be." This implies a direct relationship between the stars and Abraham’s descendants.

Further, Genesis 22:17 reinforces this connection: "That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies." The stars serve as a metaphor for the countless descendants, indicating their celestial patterning.

**As Above, So Below:**
The principle of "As above, so below," which permeates many esoteric teachings, finds resonance in biblical texts. Jesus’s words in Matthew 18:18, "Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven," reflect this interconnectedness. Similarly, God's words to Jeremiah, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you," (Jeremiah 1:5) highlight the divine foreknowledge and the cosmic patterning of individuals.

**Rebecca's Warring Nations:**
The story of Rebecca's pregnancy with Esau and Jacob in Genesis 25:23 reveals the existence of pre-birth destinies: "And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger." This story illustrates how destinies are shaped even before birth, resonating with the concept of antenatal astrology.

**Conclusion:**
The origins of antenatal astrology are deeply intertwined with ancient wisdom and biblical teachings. By exploring these connections, we can gain a deeper understanding of how celestial patterns influence human life from conception to birth. This chapter lays the foundation for integrating astrological insights with spiritual wisdom, offering a holistic approach to understanding life’s journey.

well, the ideas of the natal wheel with the sun and moon are encapsulated by Joseph's dream. The sun being 'father' and moon 'mother. But the Sun or (son) Is the actual self as the image of the father's blessing shines on the son (bowing down in obeisance) reflecting a crowned son (Ruler, self). Anyhow this wheel is represented as a man in the fetal position, each sign represnting 30 degrees and a corresponding area of the body (pisces- feet, aquarius- ankles and calfs, etc).

### Sample Chapter: Chapter 4 - Joseph's Dream and the Natal Wheel

**Introduction:**
Joseph's dream, as recounted in Genesis 37:9, is a vivid example of biblical symbolism that aligns closely with astrological concepts. In his dream, Joseph saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him. This vision not only foretold his future prominence but also encapsulates the structure of the natal wheel in astrology.

**Biblical Symbolism and Astrological Significance:**
In Joseph's dream, the sun represents the father, the moon represents the mother, and the stars represent his brothers. This imagery is mirrored in astrology, where the sun signifies the self or the central identity, the moon signifies emotions and nurturing, and the planets represent various aspects of life and personality.

**The Sun, Moon, and the Self:**
The sun or 'son' is the actual self, reflecting the father's blessing and shining as the central figure in the natal chart. The moon, as the mother, influences emotions and the subconscious. This triad of sun, moon, and planets encapsulates the familial and personal dynamics that shape an individual.

**The Natal Wheel:**
The natal wheel is an astrological chart that represents a person at birth. It is often depicted as a man in the fetal position, symbolizing the complete individual ready to be born. Each sign of the zodiac corresponds to 30 degrees of the 360-degree circle, representing different parts of the body:
- Aries: Head
- Taurus: Neck and Throat
- Gemini: Arms and Hands
- Cancer: Chest and Stomach
- Leo: Heart and Upper Back
- Virgo: Digestive System
- Libra: Lower Back and Kidneys
- Scorpio: Reproductive Organs
- Sagittarius: Thighs
- Capricorn: Knees
- Aquarius: Ankles and Calves
- Pisces: Feet

**Joseph’s Dream and the Natal Wheel:**
Joseph's dream symbolizes the astrological concept of the natal wheel. The dream foretold Joseph's rise to prominence, just as the sun's position in the natal chart can indicate one's central role in life. The dream's depiction of the sun, moon, and stars bowing to Joseph aligns with the astrological understanding of how celestial bodies influence human destiny.

**Conclusion:**
Joseph's dream and the natal wheel provide a profound intersection between biblical symbolism and astrological principles. By examining these connections, we can gain a deeper understanding of how ancient wisdom informs modern practices in antenatal astrology. The alignment of biblical narratives with astrological patterns offers a holistic view of human life and its divine orchestration.

### Sample Chapter: Chapter 6 - Antenatal Transits and Pregnancy Stages

**Introduction:**
The journey of pregnancy, spanning nine months, is a transformative period not just for the developing fetus but also for the parents. Antenatal astrology provides a unique lens to understand how the positions of celestial bodies during these crucial months influence and shape the life forming in the womb. This chapter delves into the stages of pregnancy, drawing parallels with biblical teachings and astrological transits.

**First Trimester: Conception to 12 Weeks**
The first trimester marks the beginning of a new life, a period of rapid growth and fundamental formation. Astrologically, this stage corresponds to the initial influence of the planets on the developing fetus. Each sign and planet brings specific energies that imprint on the fetus from the moment of conception.

- **Biblical Reference:**
  "At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son" (Genesis 18:14). This passage signifies the divine timing and the initial stages of life creation.

- **Astrological Influence:**
  During these first 12 weeks, the primary influences come from the Sun (identity and self), Moon (emotions and nurturing), and rising planets that dictate initial traits and potential challenges.

**Second Trimester: 13 to 26 Weeks**
The second trimester is often considered the most stable period of pregnancy. The fetus continues to grow, and parents often begin to feel the movements. Astrologically, this is the phase where the planetary influences become more defined, solidifying the characteristics of the unborn child.

- **Biblical Reference:**
  "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart" (Jeremiah 1:5). This verse highlights the divine knowledge and the ongoing formation of the individual.

- **Astrological Influence:**
  The positions of Venus (love and harmony), Mars (energy and drive), and Mercury (communication and intellect) play significant roles during this period, shaping the developing personality and future interactions.

**Third Trimester: 27 Weeks to Birth**
The final trimester is a time of preparation for birth. The fetus is almost fully formed, and the anticipation of birth heightens. Astrologically, the final transits solidify the imprints of the planets, preparing the individual for entry into the world.

- **Biblical Reference:**
  "And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb" (Genesis 25:24). This passage from the story of Rebekah emphasizes the culmination of the pregnancy and the readiness for birth.

- **Astrological Influence:**
  The final influences of Jupiter (expansion and growth), Saturn (structure and discipline), and the outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) set the stage for the newborn’s destiny and life path.

**Conclusion:**
The nine months of pregnancy are a microcosm of the influences and transformations that an individual will encounter throughout life. Antenatal astrology provides insights into how these prenatal influences shape personality, potential, and destiny. By understanding these transits and their significance, parents can gain a deeper appreciation of the divine orchestration involved in the creation of life.

### Sample Chapter: Chapter 8 - Antenatal Astrology and Fetal Development

**Introduction:**
Antenatal astrology goes beyond mere prediction; it delves into the intricate connection between celestial movements and fetal development. This chapter explores how the planetary positions during pregnancy impact the growth and characteristics of the developing fetus, intertwined with biblical insights.

**Understanding Fetal Development Through Astrology:**
From the moment of conception, the fetus is influenced by the positions of celestial bodies. Each stage of fetal development corresponds to specific astrological transits, which shape the personality and traits of the unborn child.

- **First Trimester:**
  The foundations of life are laid. The Sun's position at conception influences the core identity, while the Moon impacts emotional foundations. Mercury’s placement can indicate early cognitive development and communication patterns.

- **Second Trimester:**
  Growth and development accelerate. Venus and Mars begin to influence physical attributes and behavioral tendencies. This period also sees the influence of Jupiter, fostering growth and expansion, and Saturn, which introduces structure and discipline.

- **Third Trimester:**
  Preparation for birth. The outer planets—Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto—leave their mark, indicating potential for transformation, creativity, and deeper psychological traits.

**Biblical Insights on Fetal Development:**
Biblical teachings offer profound insights into the process of fetal development. Verses such as Psalm 139:13-14, "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made," highlight the divine involvement in the creation of life.

**Astrological and Biblical Parallels:**
The interplay between astrological influences and biblical teachings reveals a holistic understanding of fetal development. Just as astrology maps the journey of celestial bodies, the Bible narrates the divine orchestration of life.

- **Physical Development:**
  Astrological signs correspond to different body parts, emphasizing holistic development. For instance, Aries influences the head, while Pisces governs the feet, reflecting the full spectrum of human anatomy.

- **Emotional and Spiritual Growth:**
  The Moon’s phases during pregnancy mirror the emotional and spiritual nurturing of the fetus. Biblical verses reinforce this nurturing, as seen in Isaiah 49:15, "Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne?"

**Conclusion:**
Antenatal astrology provides a unique lens to understand the intricate process of fetal development. By aligning astrological insights with biblical teachings, we can appreciate the profound interconnectedness of life, offering a deeper understanding of the prenatal influences that shape our existence.

Antenatal transits trace the journey of celestial bodies from conception to birth, mapping the path of an individual and influencing their destiny. This chapter delves into the significance of these transits, with a special focus on the historical example of the Star of Bethlehem and the birth of Jesus.

**Understanding Antenatal Transits:**
Antenatal transits refer to the movements and positions of planets during the nine months of pregnancy. These transits are crucial as they leave imprints on the developing fetus, shaping personality, strengths, and potential life events.

**First Trimester: Conception to 12 Weeks**

- **Astrological Influence:**
  - **Uranus:** Encourages innovation, rebellion, and sudden changes.
  - **Neptune:** Enhances intuition, spirituality, and creativity.
  - **Pluto:** Brings transformation, power, and deep-seated changes.

**The Star of Bethlehem and Antenatal Transits:**
The Star of Bethlehem is a significant historical example of antenatal transits influencing an individual’s birth. Around 7 BC, a series of notable conjunctions occurred, heralding the birth of Jesus.

- **Historical Context:**
  - The conjunctions of Jupiter (the ruler) with the constellation "manger" (a sign of birth and nourishment) were observed by the Magi, or three wise men.
  - This rare celestial event was interpreted as the sign of the birth of a savior.

- **Astrological Significance:**
  - **Jupiter:** Symbolized kingship, rulership, and divine authority.
  - **Constellation "Manger":** Represented birth, nourishment, and the presence of a divine child.
  - **Donkey and Colt:** Biblical references (Zechariah 9:9) associated with humility and messianic prophecy.

**Detailing the Conjunctions:**
The series of conjunctions around 7 BC were pivotal in announcing the birth of Jesus. These planetary alignments created a celestial narrative that reflected the significance of the event.

- **Key Conjunctions:**
  - **Jupiter and Saturn:** Often seen as a powerful combination indicating a significant change in leadership or a new era.
  - **Jupiter and Regulus (in Leo):** Highlighted royal birth and divine kingship.
  - **Venus and Jupiter:** Signified harmony, love, and the birth of an extraordinary individual.

**Exploring the Meaning:**
The conjunctions and their interpretations by the Magi underscore the importance of antenatal transits. They followed the planets to the point where they stopped, indicating the precise location and timing of Jesus’s birth.

- **Biblical Interpretation:**
  - Matthew 2:2: "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
  - This verse reflects the Magi’s understanding of the celestial signs and their quest to honor the newborn king.

**Conclusion:**
Antenatal transits from conception to birth map the journey of an individual, revealing the influences that shape their life path. The example of the Star of Bethlehem illustrates the profound connection between celestial events and human destiny. By understanding these transits, we can gain deeper insights into the forces that shape our existence from the very beginning.

 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

Psalm 19 is a profound reflection on the glory of God as revealed through both the natural world and His law. It begins with a poetic description of the heavens, emphasizing their role in declaring God's majesty and wisdom. The passage highlights how the celestial bodies—the sun, moon, and stars—act as a universal language, communicating God's presence and power without words, across all lands and to all people.

**The Heavens and Their Testimony:**
- "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork." The psalmist begins by acknowledging that the natural world, particularly the heavens, are a testament to God's glory. The sky and all within it are seen as God's craftsmanship, each aspect of the cosmos reflecting His divine handiwork.
  
- "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge." Here, the passage suggests that every day and night, the heavens continually speak of God’s knowledge and wisdom. The movement of celestial bodies serves as an ongoing revelation of God’s design and order in the universe.

- "There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard." This line underscores the universality of this testimony; the message of the heavens transcends human language, reaching every corner of the earth.

- "Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun." The "line" or "voice" of the heavens extends globally, and within them, the sun is given a place—a "tabernacle"—which can be seen as both a literal dwelling and a symbolic representation of God's order.

**The Sun as a Symbol of God’s Glory:**
- "Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race." The sun is personified as a bridegroom, full of joy and strength, emerging to complete its daily course. This metaphor portrays the sun as both powerful and joyful, reflecting God's vitality and endurance.

- "His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof." The sun's journey across the sky is described as a circuit, emphasizing its all-encompassing reach and the fact that nothing on earth is hidden from its light and warmth. This can also be seen as a metaphor for God's omnipresence and His law, which reaches all and leaves nothing untouched.

**The Law of the Lord:**
- "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple." Transitioning from the natural world, the psalmist extols God's law. It is described as perfect, bringing transformation to the soul, and trustworthy, imparting wisdom even to the simple.

- "The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes." God's commandments are depicted as morally upright, bringing joy and clarity to those who follow them.

- "The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether." The fear of the Lord—understood as reverence and awe—is portrayed as pure and eternal, while His judgments are always true and just.

- "More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb." God's laws and decrees are more valuable than the finest gold and sweeter than the purest honey, highlighting their preciousness and desirability.

- "Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward." The psalmist acknowledges that God's laws serve as a warning and guide, and that obedience brings great reward.

**A Prayer for Cleansing and Protection:**
- "Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults." The psalmist concludes with a humble plea for forgiveness and cleansing from hidden sins—those faults we are unaware of but that still affect us.

- "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression." The prayer continues with a request for protection from willful sins, asking that they do not dominate his life. This leads to the hope of being found upright and blameless before God.

Psalm 19 beautifully intertwines the glory of God's creation with the perfection of His law, showing how both the natural world and divine commandments work together to reveal His character and guide His people. This passage invites deep reflection on how the heavens and God's word can lead us to greater understanding, wisdom, and spiritual integrity.

The law spoken of is as above so below. Thus the skies warn the servant by symbolizing.  They show men their error and keep one from being presumptuous. And keeping with the circuit of the celestial bodies or the 12th tribe zodiac system, as it is described, one becomes knowledgeable of God’s movement and we can learn about ones errors and judgment and presumptuousness. This passage is all about astrology and understandings that God pattern the 12 tribes on the stars as it said, he patterned all the peoples of the earth on the heaven.

The passage from Psalm 19 can indeed be interpreted through the lens of astrology, particularly when considering the idea that the heavens serve as a divine guide, revealing God’s will and the moral order of the universe. This interpretation aligns with the ancient belief that the movements of celestial bodies—symbolized by the zodiac—reflect the divine order and can instruct humanity in wisdom and righteousness.

### Astrology and Divine Law in Psalm 19

**The Heavens as Divine Communication:**
- "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork." In this interpretation, the heavens are not merely a display of God’s creative power, but a dynamic communication system through which God reveals His will. The celestial bodies, including the sun, moon, and stars, convey divine messages, symbolizing God’s laws and guiding humanity in understanding divine truths.

**Day and Night as Cycles of Revelation:**
- "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge." The continuous cycles of day and night symbolize the ongoing revelation from God. Just as the sun rises and sets, and the stars appear each night, these cycles represent the unending flow of divine wisdom available to those who observe and interpret the movements of the heavens.

**Universal Language of the Heavens:**
- "There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard." The movements and patterns of celestial bodies transcend human languages, offering a universal code that can be understood by all peoples. This suggests that the heavens serve as a cosmic scripture, available to everyone who seeks to understand God’s will.

**The Zodiac and Divine Patterns:**
- "Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun." This line or "circuit" can be interpreted as the zodiac, the path the sun follows through the twelve constellations. This celestial tabernacle is where the divine order is established, and the twelve zodiac signs correspond to the twelve tribes of Israel, each tribe reflecting a specific aspect of God’s covenant with humanity.

**The Sun as a Symbol of Divine Order:**
- "Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race." The sun’s daily journey mirrors the ordered movement of the cosmos, symbolizing the divine law that governs both the heavens and the earth. The sun’s path represents the righteous path that humanity is encouraged to follow, illuminated by the light of divine wisdom.

**Astrology as a Guide to Righteousness:**
- "His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof." This can be seen as a metaphor for the comprehensive nature of divine law. Just as the sun’s light reaches all corners of the earth, the knowledge embedded in the zodiac—the celestial circuit—reaches all aspects of life, providing guidance and insight into moral and spiritual truths.

**Divine Law and Human Conduct:**
- "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple." The law here is the cosmic law, the divine order revealed through the heavens. By understanding and aligning with this order, individuals can achieve spiritual transformation and wisdom.

- "Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward." The celestial bodies, through their movements and positions, warn humanity of potential errors and guide them away from presumptuousness. By studying and adhering to these signs, one aligns with the divine will, avoiding moral pitfalls and reaping spiritual rewards.

**The Zodiac as a Moral Compass:**
- Just as the twelve tribes of Israel were patterned after the stars, so too are all people of the earth influenced by the celestial patterns. By observing the zodiac and understanding the symbolism of the stars, individuals can gain insight into their own lives, errors, and judgments. The heavens, therefore, act as a moral compass, helping individuals to navigate life in accordance with divine law.

**Conclusion:**
Psalm 19, when viewed through the lens of astrology, presents the heavens as a divine manuscript written in the language of stars and planets. This celestial script guides humanity, offering wisdom and warning, and aligning us with the divine order. The passage reinforces the idea that the twelve tribes of Israel—and by extension, all of humanity—are patterned after the stars, with the zodiac serving as a cosmic map of God’s moral and spiritual law. By observing and understanding this map, individuals can avoid errors, grow in wisdom, and live in harmony with the divine will.
