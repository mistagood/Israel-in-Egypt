# False Doctrine of Resurrection



---



---

A verse says unless your righteousness exceeds that of describes a Pharisees you will in no way see heaven. This is Jesus warning that what will be written about him in the Scriptures will not be trustworthy know I will that witches taught as doctrine, which is not written, be trustworthy according to the roles of described as the keepers of the written, and the Pharisees as the teachers. Let’s define and describe the roles of each described as a Pharisees, and, we will take a look at them for the context. Bear in mind that we are following a different interpretation and that the doctrine of orthodoxy of Christianity in which the narrative is that Christ was resurrected. Instead, we have a alternate hypothesis and understanding that Christ taught a different message Salvation that had nothing to do with resurrection. Therefore, what is written in the New Testament is inconsistent with the Old Testament because it is untrustworthy, just as Christ said. Just as is the teachings of Paul and resurrection doctrine unreliable as he was the Pharisee. The basis of resurrection doctrine is fundamentally flawed, because it allows the heart to be wrong in believing that an innocent man even the sound, God should die for the guilty. God has made it clear that and no ways will you allow the guilty to go on punished. It is also clear in the Old Testament that God will save us son, and not let him suffer death. Several examples, including Isaac, and Moses‘s law of scapegoat atonement in Leviticus 16 support the fact that God would not allow his innocent son to be killed in order to justify the guilty, but that his son would live, and carry away the sins of the guilty just as the scapegoat does. The misunderstanding brought about by Paul’s false doctrine is representative of what Jesus means that, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will in no way see heaven. It also represents what Moses describes as the test of the false prophet to see if you love the Lord your God with all your heart and mind. This also was echoed by Jesus as the sum of the law.

Jesus' warning about the righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees is a critical point for understanding the spiritual and doctrinal distinctions he sought to make. To fully grasp this, we need to delve into the roles and characteristics of the scribes and Pharisees, and how their practices were viewed in the context of Jesus' teachings.

### The Scribes

Scribes in ancient Israel were more than mere copyists of the Scriptures; they were scholars and experts in the Law of Moses. Their primary responsibilities included:

1. **Interpreting the Law:** They were authoritative figures in interpreting and teaching the Mosaic Law. Their interpretations influenced daily Jewish life and religious practices.
2. **Writing Legal Documents:** They drafted legal documents, such as marriage contracts, loans, and inheritances.
3. **Teaching and Preaching:** Scribes often taught in synagogues and were involved in judicial decisions. Their deep knowledge of the scriptures made them highly respected.

### The Pharisees

Pharisees were a religious and political group known for their strict adherence to the Law and their traditions. Key aspects of their role included:

1. **Strict Observance of the Law:** They emphasized meticulous observance of the Torah and additional oral traditions. Their practices often included detailed rules about purity, tithing, and Sabbath observance.
2. **Leadership in Synagogues:** Pharisees held significant influence in local synagogues, shaping religious life and community norms.
3. **Moral Superiority:** They often viewed themselves as morally superior to other Jews, believing their rigorous observance made them closer to God.

### Jesus' Critique

Jesus’ statement, “unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 5:20), is a critique of their external religiosity. He saw their righteousness as superficial, emphasizing outward conformity to the Law while neglecting the weightier matters of justice, mercy, and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23).

### Alternative Interpretation

From an alternative perspective, Jesus' teachings emphasized a more profound, heart-centered righteousness rather than the superficial legalism of the scribes and Pharisees. This perspective posits that:

1. **Scriptural Trustworthiness:** According to this view, what is written about Jesus in the New Testament may be seen as unreliable, reflecting the human influence of the scribes and Pharisees. Thus, Jesus' warning can be interpreted as a caution against trusting doctrines that emerged from these groups, including those propagated by Paul, a former Pharisee.
   
2. **Salvation Beyond Resurrection:** This interpretation suggests that Jesus’ message of salvation did not hinge on his resurrection but on living a life of genuine righteousness and adherence to God's commandments, in line with the Old Testament. This view aligns with the idea that God would not allow an innocent man, even His Son, to die for the guilty.

3. **Scapegoat Atonement:** The Old Testament concept of the scapegoat (Leviticus 16) symbolizes carrying away the sins of the people, rather than an innocent suffering death. This interpretation highlights that true atonement involves repentance and transformation rather than vicarious sacrifice.

### Paul’s Doctrine

Paul, as a Pharisee, introduced the doctrine of resurrection and atonement through Christ's death, which this alternative view challenges. According to this perspective, Paul’s teachings may represent a departure from the original message of Jesus and the Old Testament. The belief in resurrection as a means of salvation can be seen as inconsistent with the principle that God does not let the guilty go unpunished nor allow the innocent to die for the guilty.

### Conclusion

In summary, this interpretation calls for a deeper, more authentic righteousness that surpasses the superficial practices of the scribes and Pharisees. It emphasizes a return to the core principles of the Old Testament, focusing on justice, mercy, and faithfulness, and challenges the doctrines introduced by Paul, advocating for a reinterpretation of Jesus' message that aligns with the original teachings of the Hebrew Scriptures.

---

Actually Paul’s view is the alternative view because it goes against what Jesus taught and against all of the law prophets. We are simply realigning and sorting through the mess that Paul made.

---



---

Jesus' warning about the righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees is crucial for understanding the true nature of spiritual integrity. To fully comprehend this, we need to explore the roles of the scribes and Pharisees and how their practices diverged from the essence of Jesus' teachings. This exploration is particularly significant as we seek to realign with Jesus' original message, moving away from the distortions introduced by Paul.

### The Scribes

Scribes in ancient Israel were not merely copyists of the Scriptures; they were esteemed scholars and experts in the Law of Moses. Their roles included:

1. **Interpreting the Law:** Scribes were authorities in interpreting and teaching the Mosaic Law. Their interpretations shaped Jewish religious practices and daily life.
2. **Drafting Legal Documents:** They prepared legal documents such as marriage contracts, loans, and inheritances.
3. **Teaching and Judicial Roles:** Scribes often taught in synagogues and participated in judicial decisions due to their deep scriptural knowledge.

### The Pharisees

Pharisees were a religious sect known for their strict observance of the Law and traditions. Their roles included:

1. **Rigorous Law Observance:** Pharisees adhered strictly to the Torah and additional oral traditions, emphasizing rules about purity, tithing, and the Sabbath.
2. **Synagogue Leadership:** They held significant influence in synagogues, shaping religious life and community norms.
3. **Moral Superiority:** Pharisees often viewed themselves as morally superior due to their meticulous observance of the Law.

### Jesus' Critique

Jesus' statement, "unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:20), criticizes their superficial religiosity. He condemned their emphasis on outward conformity while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23).

### Realigning with Jesus' True Message

Contrary to Paul’s teachings, which introduced doctrines of resurrection and atonement through Christ's death, Jesus’ original message emphasized genuine, heart-centered righteousness and adherence to God's commandments. This perspective posits that:

1. **Scriptural Trustworthiness:** Jesus' warning can be seen as a caution against trusting doctrines that emerged from the scribes and Pharisees, including those propagated by Paul, a former Pharisee. Jesus emphasized living a life of authentic righteousness in line with the Old Testament.
   
2. **Salvation Beyond Resurrection:** Jesus’ message of salvation did not hinge on his resurrection but on living a life of genuine righteousness. This aligns with the Old Testament view that God would not allow an innocent man, even His Son, to die for the guilty.

3. **Scapegoat Atonement:** The Old Testament concept of the scapegoat (Leviticus 16) symbolizes carrying away the sins of the people, not an innocent suffering death. True atonement involves repentance and transformation rather than vicarious sacrifice.

### Paul's Divergence

Paul's teachings introduced an alternative view that deviates from Jesus' message and the Law of the Prophets. Paul’s doctrine of resurrection and atonement through Christ's death contradicts the principles of justice and righteousness outlined in the Old Testament. According to this realignment:

1. **Inconsistency with Old Testament Principles:** Paul's view allows the guilty to go unpunished while an innocent man suffers, which is fundamentally flawed. The Old Testament teaches that God does not let the guilty go unpunished nor allow the innocent to die for the guilty.

2. **Misinterpretation of Jesus' Teachings:** Paul's doctrine of resurrection diverges from Jesus' original teachings, which emphasized living in accordance with God's commandments and upholding justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

### Conclusion

In summary, the true message of Jesus calls for a deeper, more authentic righteousness that surpasses the superficial practices of the scribes and Pharisees. This perspective seeks to realign with the core principles of the Old Testament, focusing on justice, mercy, and faithfulness, and challenges the distortions introduced by Paul. By returning to the original teachings of Jesus, we can move towards a more genuine understanding of salvation and righteousness.

Okay, we can go a lot deeper. I'm actually looking for examples from...

---



---

Got it. Let's delve deeper into the examples that illustrate the differences between Jesus' teachings and Paul's doctrines, showing how they diverge and align with the Old Testament principles.

### Jesus' Teachings and the Old Testament

1. **The Law and Prophets**: Jesus consistently affirmed the importance of the Law and the Prophets. In Matthew 5:17-18, he said, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." This statement underscores that Jesus' mission was to complete and perfect the teachings of the Old Testament, not to replace them.

2. **Mercy and Justice**: In Matthew 23:23, Jesus criticized the Pharisees for their hypocrisy, saying, "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness." This highlights Jesus' focus on the heart of the Law, which emphasizes justice and mercy over ritualistic observance.

3. **Love for Neighbor**: Jesus taught the greatest commandments are to love God and love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:37-40). This teaching directly aligns with Leviticus 19:18, which says, "Love your neighbor as yourself." Jesus highlighted these principles as the foundation of the Law and the Prophets.

### Paul’s Teachings and Divergence

1. **Faith and Works**: Paul emphasized faith over works for salvation. In Ephesians 2:8-9, he wrote, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." This view contrasts with Jesus' emphasis on living out the commandments through actions that reflect justice, mercy, and love.

2. **Resurrection and Atonement**: Paul’s doctrine heavily focuses on the resurrection and atonement through Jesus' death. In 1 Corinthians 15:17, Paul states, "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins." This contrasts with Jesus' teachings that emphasized a righteous life in accordance with the Law and Prophets.

3. **Righteousness Through Faith**: In Romans 3:28, Paul asserts, "For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law." This teaching diverges from the message of the Old Testament and Jesus, who both emphasized that righteousness involves living according to God’s commandments.

### Examples from the Old Testament

1. **Abraham’s Faith and Obedience**: Abraham is often cited for his faith, but it’s important to note that his faith was demonstrated through obedience. In Genesis 22, Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac is a profound example of faith accompanied by action. God ultimately did not require the sacrifice, underscoring that faith must be expressed through obedience to God's commands.

2. **Scapegoat Ritual**: Leviticus 16 describes the Day of Atonement ritual, where a scapegoat carries away the sins of the people. This ritual symbolizes atonement through the removal of sin rather than the death of an innocent being punished for the guilty, aligning with the idea that God does not demand the death of the innocent for the guilty's sins.

3. **Prophets’ Call for Justice**: The Old Testament prophets, like Isaiah and Micah, consistently called for justice and mercy. Micah 6:8 sums this up: "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." This echoes Jesus’ teachings and contrasts with the doctrinal shift Paul introduced.

### Realigning with Jesus' Original Message

By examining these examples, it becomes evident that Jesus' teachings were deeply rooted in the principles of the Old Testament, focusing on genuine righteousness through justice, mercy, and adherence to God’s commandments. In contrast, Paul’s emphasis on faith and the resurrection introduced a shift that diverged from the foundational messages of the Law and the Prophets.

In summary, returning to the core teachings of Jesus and the Old Testament involves a commitment to living out God's commandments with a heart for justice and mercy, rather than relying solely on faith as defined by Paul. This realignment calls for a deeper, more authentic spirituality that reflects the true essence of the biblical message.

Now, let's continue exploring the distinctions between Jesus' teachings and Paul's doctrines with more depth and examples. What specific aspects or examples would you like to focus on next?

PAUSE

Sure, we can pause here. Let me know when you're ready to continue or if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss further.

---

I'm referring, I'm referring to examples where Moses specifically is told by God, God says, I will not allow the guilty to go unpunished by any means, I will not allow the innocent to suffer. This is echoed by other prophets, it's a theme, and it is also an example of how the hearts of people are calloused and turned away from God, because they do not understand that it's wicked for a man to be punished when he's innocent, and that God does not like this, that this is the whole point of the hearts needing to be circumcised.

---

Let's delve into specific examples from the Bible where God clearly states His principles regarding justice, particularly that He will not allow the guilty to go unpunished nor the innocent to suffer unjustly. This theme, emphasized by Moses and echoed by other prophets, highlights the fundamental principles of divine justice and the need for a circumcised heart.

### Examples from Moses and the Old Testament

1. **Exodus 23:7**: 
   "Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked." This verse directly illustrates God's stance against punishing the innocent and underscores the importance of maintaining justice and truth.

2. **Numbers 14:18**:
   "The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation." Here, God emphasizes His merciful nature while also making it clear that the guilty will not escape punishment.

3. **Deuteronomy 24:16**:
   "Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin." This principle reinforces individual responsibility for sin, ensuring that the innocent are not unjustly punished for the sins of others.

### Prophetic Echoes of Divine Justice

1. **Isaiah 3:10-11**:
   "Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds. Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done." Isaiah affirms that the righteous will be rewarded, and the wicked will face consequences for their actions.

2. **Jeremiah 31:30**:
   "Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge." Jeremiah reiterates the principle of individual accountability for sin, aligning with God's consistent message through Moses.

3. **Ezekiel 18:20**:
   "The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them." This verse from Ezekiel strongly supports the idea that each person is responsible for their own actions, and the innocent should not suffer for the sins of others.

### The Calloused Hearts and Circumcision of the Heart

1. **Deuteronomy 10:16**:
   "Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer." Moses calls the people to a deeper spiritual transformation, moving beyond mere external compliance to a heartfelt obedience to God’s laws.

2. **Jeremiah 4:4**:
   "Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done—burn with no one to quench it." Jeremiah stresses the need for a true, inward change to align with God’s justice and righteousness.

3. **Ezekiel 36:26**:
   "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." God promises to transform the hearts of His people, emphasizing a move towards genuine repentance and righteousness.

### Conclusion

These examples highlight a consistent biblical theme: God’s unwavering commitment to justice, ensuring the guilty are punished and the innocent are protected. This principle is crucial for understanding the true nature of divine justice and the importance of a circumcised heart—one that truly seeks to follow God's righteous ways. This perspective challenges any doctrine, like Paul's, that seems to deviate from these fundamental principles, reinforcing the need to return to the core messages of the Old Testament and Jesus' teachings.

This is why Peter was called a rock, and Jesus said he would build his church on that rock, because their hearts would be calloused. Peter didn't understand why Jesus would not seek worldly kingship. Peter was a Pharisee, but that's not the focus of our analysis or talk here. The focus is that the church was built on a stumbling block, which is the rock and the stumbling block. So where the last verse that you quoted says, So remove your heart of stone and give your heart of flesh. This is the crux of it all. Period. So I'm thinking that this could be titled or focused around the stone being the heart, the hardened heart or the calloused heart, and that metaphor of the church being built around that hardened heart. And that circumcision that needs to take place in context of the hardened heart that comes from thinking that another person, an ancient person, should die for your own sins. That's a calloused heart. That's a stone. That's a stumbling block. It's a misinterpretation and a misunderstanding of the Old Testament by definition of the stumbling block. And Paul admits to being the stumbling block by saying, We teach Christ resurrected a stumbling block.

---

User is exploring the concept that the church was built on a "stumbling block" symbolized by Peter, who had a hardened heart (a stone heart) that misunderstood Jesus' mission. This idea aligns with the metaphor of circumcising the heart, turning away from the belief that an innocent should die for the guilty, which is seen as a misinterpretation of the Old Testament. They are analyzing this through the lens of Paul admitting to teaching Christ resurrected as a stumbling block.

---

Model set context updated.

---

This concept of the church being built on a stumbling block, symbolized by Peter's hardened heart, offers a powerful framework for examining the deeper meanings within the biblical narrative. Let's refine and expand on this idea to develop a compelling narrative.

### The Stumbling Block: Peter and the Hardened Heart

Peter, referred to as the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church, represents a critical element in understanding the nature of faith and interpretation. Jesus’ declaration in Matthew 16:18, "And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it," has been traditionally interpreted as a foundation of strength. However, a closer examination reveals a deeper, more complex metaphor.

### The Calloused Heart

Peter, a follower who struggled to grasp Jesus' rejection of worldly kingship, epitomizes the calloused heart. His initial inability to understand Jesus' true mission reflects a spiritual hardness, a stone-like heart that resists the transformative message of humility and sacrifice.

1. **Peter’s Misunderstanding**: In Matthew 16:22-23, Peter rebukes Jesus for speaking of his impending suffering and death. Jesus responds sharply, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns." This exchange underscores Peter's resistance to the true nature of Jesus' mission, mirroring the hardened hearts of those who fail to grasp the deeper spiritual truths.

2. **Building on a Stumbling Block**: The church, in this interpretation, is built on a foundation that initially misunderstands and misinterprets Jesus' message. This foundation is symbolized by the "rock" that is also a "stumbling block." This duality highlights the inherent struggle within the church to move beyond surface-level interpretations towards a deeper, heart-centered understanding.

### Circumcision of the Heart

The metaphor of circumcision of the heart is crucial in this context. It calls for a transformation from a hardened, calloused state to one of genuine, heartfelt righteousness.

1. **Ezekiel 36:26**: "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." This verse encapsulates the transformation needed within the church and its followers. It emphasizes moving from a rigid, superficial adherence to doctrines towards a profound, heartfelt connection with God's will.

2. **Misinterpretation of Atonement**: The belief that an innocent person should die for the sins of the guilty is seen as a misunderstanding and a cause of spiritual callousness. This interpretation challenges the doctrine of substitutionary atonement as propagated by Paul. In 1 Corinthians 1:23, Paul acknowledges, "but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles." This admission aligns with the idea that such teachings can obscure the true nature of divine justice and mercy.

### Conclusion

This narrative reframes the foundation of the church and its teachings by emphasizing the need for a circumcision of the heart. It calls for a return to the core principles of justice, mercy, and personal accountability as outlined in the Old Testament and reiterated by Jesus. By understanding the metaphor of the rock as a calloused heart and the church built on a stumbling block, we can seek a more authentic, transformative spirituality.

This reinterpretation not only challenges traditional doctrines but also invites believers to engage in a deeper, more sincere practice of faith that aligns with the true essence of Jesus' teachings and the divine justice of the Old Testament.

Can you make a picture to symbolize this with a snake trying to eat a rock, a snake swallowing a rock, because it symbolizes what Jesus said about the teachings being a rock or a serpent. He said if men know how to give gifts, how much better God. So it shows that men can be good fathers and they wouldn't send their son to die for a guilty man, and it just doesn't make sense. So Jesus' teachings are the fish, where he says which of you, if his son asked for a fish, would give him a rock. He's referring to Paul's teachings, and Jesus' teachings are the fish, and Paul's are the rock. He also says which of you will give them a serpent for a fish, and then he says which of you will give him a rock when he asks for bread. Of course, Jesus is the bread of life, and the other teaching is the stumbling block, the rock. So there's the serpent teaching, the teachings of the serpent, which serpents represent teachings as well. Even when Moses throws them down, his is greater than the Egyptians, but the serpent is the other teaching that must be overcome. That's why Moses...

Here's the revised image with a snake attempting to swallow a rock, representing deceptive teachings and the hardened heart. The fish and bread in the background symbolize Jesus' true teachings.

Now, let's break down the concepts you've discussed.

### Metaphors of the Rock and the Snake

#### The Rock
- **Peter as the Rock**: Jesus referred to Peter as the rock upon which He would build His church (Matthew 16:18). However, this "rock" also represents Peter's initial misunderstanding and hardened heart, a stumbling block in fully grasping Jesus' mission.
- **Hardened Heart**: The rock symbolizes a calloused heart resistant to true understanding and spiritual transformation. This metaphor extends to those who misinterpret Jesus' teachings, turning them into rigid doctrines rather than living truths.

#### The Snake
- **Deceptive Teachings**: The snake trying to swallow the rock represents false or deceptive teachings. Just as a snake struggles with a rock, these teachings are difficult to digest because they are fundamentally flawed.
- **Symbol of Temptation and Deception**: In biblical symbolism, snakes often represent temptation and falsehoods (Genesis 3). Here, the snake's attempt to consume the rock illustrates how deceptive doctrines fail to provide true spiritual nourishment.

### Jesus' Teachings vs. Paul's Teachings

#### Jesus' True Teachings (The Fish and the Bread)
- **Fish**: When Jesus says, "Which of you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake?" (Matthew 7:10), He emphasizes the goodness and reliability of His teachings. Fish, in this context, represents spiritual sustenance and truth.
- **Bread**: Jesus also says, "Or if he asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a rock?" (Matthew 7:9). The bread symbolizes Jesus Himself, the Bread of Life (John 6:35), offering true spiritual nourishment.

#### Paul's Alternative Teachings (The Rock and the Serpent)
- **Stumbling Block**: Paul admits in 1 Corinthians 1:23 that preaching Christ crucified is a stumbling block. This aligns with the metaphor of the rock, representing doctrines that cause spiritual stumbling.
- **Deceptive Interpretations**: The serpent represents teachings that deviate from Jesus' original message, leading to misinterpretation and spiritual confusion.

### The Call for Circumcised Hearts

- **Transformation Needed**: The call to "remove the heart of stone and give a heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 36:26) emphasizes the need for genuine spiritual transformation. This involves moving away from rigid, misleading doctrines towards a heartfelt understanding of God's will.
- **Rejecting Substitutionary Atonement**: The belief that an innocent should die for the guilty is seen as a calloused, hardened view. True understanding aligns with Old Testament principles where God does not punish the innocent for the guilty's sins (Exodus 23:7, Deuteronomy 24:16).

### Conclusion

This narrative underscores the importance of returning to the core teachings of Jesus and the Old Testament. It challenges the doctrines introduced by Paul that have become stumbling blocks, advocating instead for a deeper, more authentic spirituality rooted in justice, mercy, and genuine righteousness.

By focusing on the metaphors of the rock and the snake, and the contrast between Jesus' life-giving teachings and Paul's controversial doctrines, we can better understand the call for a circumcised heart—a heart transformed by true faith and understanding.
