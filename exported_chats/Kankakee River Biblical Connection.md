# Kankakee River Biblical Connection



---



---

What's the history of the Kankakee River and does it connect to the Great Lakes? Where does it go? I'm here at the location shooting footage for a documentary in Illinois and I'm wanting to connect this to the crossing of Joshua into the promised land where he set up structures beneath the water when they crossed. There have been structures discovered in Lake Michigan which I believe may be worth investigating as a crossing point into the promised land or Canaan also known as Canada in biblical terms. Is Illinois the land of freedom

User is currently shooting footage for a documentary in Illinois, focusing on the Kankakee River and its connection to the Great Lakes. They are interested in linking this to the biblical account of Joshua's crossing into the promised land, drawing parallels with structures discovered in Lake Michigan. They believe this area may be significant as a crossing point into the promised land, possibly corresponding to Canada. They are also exploring the concept of Illinois as the land of freedom.

The Kankakee River has a rich and complex history, especially in its relationship to the Great Lakes region. The river originates near South Bend, Indiana, and flows westward through northern Indiana before entering Illinois, where it eventually joins the Illinois River. Historically, the Kankakee River was part of a vast network of waterways that played a significant role in the lives of Native American tribes and early European explorers. The river's connection to the Illinois River links it to the Mississippi River system, which ultimately flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Kankakee River does not directly connect to the Great Lakes, but its proximity and watershed are part of the larger hydrological system that includes the Great Lakes. The river's route through Illinois passes through what was once the Grand Kankakee Marsh, one of the largest wetlands in North America before it was drained in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for agriculture and development.

Regarding your documentary and the connection to the biblical narrative of Joshua crossing into the promised land, there is an intriguing parallel to be drawn. Joshua's crossing of the Jordan River involved the setting up of twelve stones beneath the water as a memorial to the miraculous crossing. Similarly, underwater structures discovered in Lake Michigan, such as the enigmatic "Stonehenge" found beneath the lake, have sparked curiosity and debate among researchers. Some speculate that these structures could be remnants of ancient civilizations or natural formations with significant cultural importance.

If you consider the idea that Illinois could be seen as a "land of freedom," it's interesting to note the state's historical significance in the context of the Underground Railroad and the abolitionist movement. Illinois was a crucial crossroads for many escaping slavery, offering a pathway to freedom in the North. This aligns with the broader theme of a promised land—a place of deliverance and hope.

In your documentary, you could explore these connections by examining how the Kankakee River, as part of the larger Mississippi watershed, might symbolically represent a journey toward freedom, much like Joshua's crossing into Canaan. The structures in Lake Michigan could then serve as a modern-day parallel to the ancient stones of remembrance, linking the spiritual and physical landscapes in a compelling narrative that resonates with both biblical and historical themes.

Let’s get a script, connecting this to the underground railroad Canada and Canaan and Joshua as iterated above

*[Scene opens with sweeping drone shots of the Kankakee River, its waters winding through the lush landscapes of Illinois. The camera moves towards the horizon, hinting at the vast network of waterways connecting the heart of America to the distant Great Lakes. A solemn, evocative music score underscores the weight of history in these waters.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"In the quiet flow of the Kankakee River, echoes of ancient journeys ripple beneath the surface—journeys that intertwine the sacred with the struggle for freedom. Here, where the river carves its path through the heartland of Illinois, we find ourselves standing at a crossroads of history, where the spiritual and the historical meet."

*[Cut to historical reenactments interspersed with archival images of the Underground Railroad. We see shadows of figures, escaping under the cover of night, moving along the riverbanks.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"Long before these waters bore witness to the footsteps of those fleeing the chains of slavery, another crossing took place—a crossing that would become one of the most profound moments in biblical history. The story of Joshua leading the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Promised Land resonates here, in the land we now call Illinois. Just as Joshua led his people to freedom in Canaan, so too did countless souls seek their promised land—a land of freedom—northward to Canada."

*[Cut to shots of the Illinois countryside, transitioning from day to night, with the stars reflecting in the river's surface.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"The river's waters, like the Jordan before it, served as both a barrier and a passageway. For those escaping the tyranny of slavery, Illinois was a critical junction on the Underground Railroad, a network of hidden routes and safe houses that guided the oppressed to freedom. But this was more than a mere physical journey; it was a passage steeped in the spiritual quest for liberation, echoing the Israelites' journey through the wilderness."

*[The camera pans across an artist's rendering of the "Stonehenge" structures discovered beneath Lake Michigan. The mysterious underwater formations evoke a sense of wonder and ancient history.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"In the depths of Lake Michigan, beneath the waves, lies a mystery—an ancient structure that some say could be a marker, a signpost left by those who walked this land long before us. Like the twelve stones Joshua placed beneath the waters of the Jordan, these submerged stones might be a testament to a crossing—a passage into a new world, a land of freedom, perhaps the Canaan of a new era."

*[Cut to shots of modern-day Canada, with imagery of its natural beauty and freedom.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"Canada, the Promised Land for so many who braved the perils of the Underground Railroad, was more than just a destination. It was the Canaan of the North, where the chains of bondage were broken, and the weary found rest. In the biblical narrative, Canaan was a land flowing with milk and honey—a symbol of divine promise. For those who made the perilous journey northward, Canada represented the fulfillment of that promise: a land where they could live free, far from the reach of their oppressors."

*[The camera returns to the Kankakee River at sunrise, the light breaking over the water, symbolizing hope and new beginnings.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"And so, the Kankakee River, this seemingly humble waterway, becomes a symbol—a link between the past and the present, between the biblical and the historical. It is a river of crossings, of journeys undertaken in faith, of a people led by the promise of freedom. Whether it was Joshua leading his people into Canaan, or the freedom seekers of the Underground Railroad crossing into Canada, the message is the same: the journey to the Promised Land is one of hope, resilience, and unwavering belief in the possibility of a better tomorrow."

*[The screen fades to black with the sound of flowing water and distant bird calls, leaving the viewer with a sense of profound reflection.]*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
"In this land, in this river, the spirit of freedom flows, ever forward, ever true."

*[End scene.]*
