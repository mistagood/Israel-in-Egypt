# Ravenous Wolf Bible Mentions



---



---

I need all mentions of ravenous wolf or raven as a wolf or ravening wolves in the Bible.

---



---

Here is a complete list of all scriptural mentions of **“ravenous wolf,” “raven as a wolf,”** or **“ravening wolves”** (or their close variants) in the Bible. These phrases are rare and highly symbolic, tied to prophetic warnings and tribal identities.

## 🐺 ALL MENTIONS: “RAVENOUS WOLF” / “RAVENING WOLVES” / “RAVEN AS A WOLF”

---

### 1. **Genesis 49:27** – _“Benjamin shall raven as a wolf”_

> **“Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.”**  
> — *Genesis 49:27 (KJV)*

- This is Jacob’s prophetic “blessing” (more accurately a foretelling) over his sons.
- The Hebrew word translated “**raven**” is **"יִטְרָף" (yitraf)** from the root **ṭāraph**, meaning “to tear apart,” “to seize,” or “to devour violently.”
- Benjamin is the only tribe described this way.
- This verse serves as the foundational proof text for linking the **tribe of Benjamin**—and, by extension, Paul the Benjamite (Philippians 3:5)—to **predatory, violent, or deceptive traits**, especially when juxtaposed with Messiah warnings.

---

### 2. **Ezekiel 22:27** – _“Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey”_

> **“Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.”**  
> — *Ezekiel 22:27 (KJV)*

- Description of corrupt leadership in Jerusalem.
- The term “**ravening**” again comes from **ṭāraph**.
- These wolves destroy **souls** and shed **blood**—connecting to the **shedding of innocent blood** theme and the corruption of the priesthood (see also Ezekiel 22:25–28).

---

### 3. **Zephaniah 3:3** – _“Her judges are evening wolves”_

> **“Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.”**  
> — *Zephaniah 3:3 (KJV)*

- The “**evening wolves**” are greedy and insatiable.
- Connected again with leadership corruption and oppression.
- Though it doesn't say “ravenous,” the metaphor is identical in function—predators who leave nothing behind.

---

### 4. **Matthew 7:15** – _“Beware of false prophets…inwardly they are ravening wolves”_

> **“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.”**  
> — *Matthew 7:15 (KJV)*

- Spoken by Jesus.
- Direct echo of Genesis 49:27 in imagery: **ravening wolf in disguise**.
- Jesus warns that **false prophets wear sheep’s clothing**, disguising themselves as part of the flock, but are internally devourers.
- Critical for linking Paul's disguise (2 Corinthians 11:13–15) to this warning.

---

### 5. **Acts 20:29** – _“Grievous wolves shall enter in among you”_

> **“For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.”**  
> — *Acts 20:29 (KJV)*

- Spoken by Paul.
- Though Paul is warning others, it’s ironic that many read this as **a confession** or **projection** of his own role.
- The Greek for “**grievous wolves**” is **λύκοι βαρεῖς** (*lykoi bareis*), meaning **heavy or oppressive wolves**.
- They “will not spare the flock”—same language as **devouring** or **ravaging**.
