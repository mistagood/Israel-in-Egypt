# Zondervan Ham and Race

What does Zondervan say about Ham and the Negro people?

Zondervan, a prominent evangelical Christian publishing house, produced a Bible dictionary in the mid-20th century that has been widely cited and, at times, criticized for racially charged language—particularly in its entry on **Ham**. In older editions of the *Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary* (notably from the 1950s and 1960s), the entry for Ham stated something like the following:

> “The descendants of Ham are generally associated with the dark races, **not** the Negroes, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites.”

This statement is significant for two reasons:

1. **It distinguishes Negroes from Hamites**, despite the common historical association (especially during the 18th–20th centuries) of Black Africans with Ham in the so-called "Curse of Ham" theory—a misinterpretation of Genesis 9 used to justify slavery.

2. **It contradicts racist theological traditions** that used the curse on Canaan (not Ham himself) to justify enslavement of African people, particularly those of West African descent brought to the Americas.

### Interpretive Significance

Zondervan’s statement appears to *reject* the idea that “Negroes” (a term now outdated and offensive, but then in common usage) were Hamites. This could reflect:

- An attempt to correct the historical misuse of biblical genealogy to justify racism and slavery.
- Or, alternatively, a reflection of the racial theories of the time, which often separated North Africans (like Egyptians and Cushites) from Sub-Saharan Africans in pseudo-anthropological categories.

### Contemporary Editions

Modern Zondervan publications no longer include this statement. Current Bible dictionaries and study Bibles have largely removed racially coded interpretations of Genesis 9–10, focusing instead on geographical, linguistic, and historical descriptions of the so-called Table of Nations.

### Historical Context

The older Zondervan quote fits within a broader history of Bible scholarship being used to classify and racialize human groups. However, the quote also subtly challenges the idea that African Americans (then labeled as “Negroes”) were the cursed descendants of Ham—a belief foundational to the theology of slavery and segregation.

Would you like me to provide citations from different editions of Zondervan’s dictionary or compare it to other Bible dictionaries like *Smith’s*, *Unger’s*, or *Holman’s*?
