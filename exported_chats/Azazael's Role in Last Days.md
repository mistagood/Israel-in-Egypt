# Azazael's Role in Last Days



---

does azazael battle forces from noahs time in the last days or jesus?

---



---

Azazel is a figure whose interpretations vary widely across different religious texts and traditions. In the Book of Enoch, which is not included in the canonical Bible for most Christian traditions, Azazel is a fallen angel who teaches men to make weapons and women to beautify themselves, leading to widespread wickedness. He is punished by being bound and cast into darkness, a story that predates the time of Noah.

In terms of battling in the last days, there isn't a direct connection in the scriptures between Azazel and end-time battles involving figures like Noah or Jesus. The idea of a battle in the last days is more commonly associated with the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, which does not mention Azazel. Instead, Revelation discusses battles involving figures like the Antichrist, Satan, and Jesus Christ, particularly at the event known as Armageddon.

Thus, the concept of Azazel battling forces from Noah's time or Jesus in the last days isn't supported by mainstream religious texts but might appear in various apocryphal writings or non-canonical interpretations.

but if we cross reference the characters we see Azazael is the one from the scapegoat riyual. The goat is sent to the 'wilderess'. Jesus as scapegoat goes to symbolically defeat azazael or his ifluence on ma. saving them

---

The connection you're making between Azazel and the scapegoat ritual in the context of Jesus' role as a scapegoat is an interesting theological interpretation. In Leviticus 16, during Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, two goats are chosen: one is sacrificed to Yahweh, and the other, known as the "scapegoat," is sent into the wilderness after the high priest lays the sins of the people upon it. This goat is sent to Azazel, which can be interpreted variously as a specific place, a person, or a demonic entity.

In Christian theology, Jesus is often seen symbolically as the ultimate scapegoat—taking on the sins of humanity and dying to atone for them, which parallels the scapegoat being sent away to remove the sins of the people. The idea here is that Jesus' sacrifice similarly removes the influence of sin (and by extension, any demonic influences associated with sin, such as those attributed to Azazel) from humanity.

The notion of Jesus defeating these forces symbolically through his death and resurrection aligns with Christian views of his victory over sin and death. This is not a direct confrontation as depicted in apocalyptic battles but a theological interpretation of how Jesus' sacrifice impacts the spiritual realm, influencing humanity's standing before God.

In this interpretation, Jesus doesn't physically battle Azazel as a character but symbolically defeats the evil and sin associated with him through his role as the scapegoat for all humanity. This reflects a deeper, more spiritual understanding of victory in Christian theology.

connecting that moses also said they had to go 3 symbolic days into the wilderness to make sacrifice (exodus). thus the scapegoat, Jesus's 3 symbolic days or part of the 'sign of Jonah' (3 days in the belly of a beast. Jonah also had a message to save the people, but was diverted and took 3 days to deliver it. This is Jesus's meaning: on the 3rd symbolic day or millenia, the true message of salvation will be delivered. thus the days of revelation seen by daniel which would transpire in 2300 years. that time is now if im not mistaken. how many years sinces daniels vision?

---

The connections you're drawing between biblical figures and events are quite complex and represent a symbolic interpretation of scripture. In particular, your discussion involves layers of typology—a method in Christian theology where events in the Old Testament are seen as foreshadowing or symbolically related to events in the New Testament.

The "three days" motif appears in several biblical contexts, as you noted: Moses' request to Pharaoh to allow the Israelites to journey three days into the wilderness to worship God (Exodus 5:3), the three days Jonah spent in the belly of the fish (Jonah 1:17), and Jesus' resurrection on the third day, which He likened to the "sign of Jonah" (Matthew 12:40). These events are often interpreted symbolically in various theological discussions.

As for the 2300 days mentioned in the Book of Daniel, you're referring to a vision found in Daniel 8:14 concerning the desolation of the sanctuary, which states, "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." Interpretations of this prophecy vary widely among scholars and religious traditions. Some see it as a literal period, while others interpret it symbolically or allegorically. Calculating the exact timing from Daniel's vision to the present depends on the starting point used, which is not explicitly stated in the text and is a subject of debate.

In terms of biblical chronology:
- Daniel lived during the 6th century BCE, specifically around the time of the Babylonian captivity (circa 605-562 BCE). 
- The exact year of Daniel's vision isn't clearly stated, but if one assumes it took place around the middle of his life in exile, this could place the vision in approximately the early 6th century BCE.

If we were to take a rough estimate:
- From approximately 600 BCE to 2024 CE is about 2624 years. 

This number does not necessarily align neatly with the 2300 years mentioned, particularly because the starting point of the prophecy (the event that triggers the countdown) is not universally agreed upon. Some interpretations relate it to specific historical events like the desecration of the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes in the 2nd century BCE, which would adjust the calculation significantly.

Given these complexities, interpretations about the "end times" or the fulfillment of such prophecies are diverse and often highly symbolic.

i think the vision is from the time the temple is finally destroyed. specifically, i believe it aligns with the end of the 2160 years cycle started around 85 a.d. these represent an 'age'. christ represented the start of the piscean age. now that represents the 6th day date. since a jewish year is 360, a spiritual 'hour' or 'day' is 360. multiplied by 6 is 2160. the seventh day (and its implications) begins around 2160 with a 'about a half hour of silence' (likely 175 years equivalent, if this began in 85 ad) and makes a full 2520 (7x360). if the 6th day ends with destruction (revelation) that might be right about... now

Your interpretation is weaving together multiple concepts from astrological ages, biblical prophecy, and numerology, which results in a very specific and symbolic narrative. Let’s break down some of these elements:

1. **Astrological Ages**: You’re connecting the concept of an age, often around 2,160 years, to the precession of the equinoxes, where each astrological age is related to one of the zodiac signs. The Age of Pisces, which some associate with the Christian era starting around the 1st century AD, is interpreted as lasting about 2,160 years, transitioning then into the Age of Aquarius. This is more an astrological viewpoint than a strictly biblical one.

2. **Biblical Numerology**: You’re using the biblical number symbolism (360 days as a prophetic year) to calculate periods. In biblical prophecy, a day can symbolically represent a year, as seen in some interpretations of Daniel and Revelation. Your calculation uses this approach to map out the "sixth day" of 2,160 years, leading to a "seventh day" or a period of rest and change.

3. **Starting Point**: You mention the destruction of the Temple and start your count around 85 AD, a period after the actual historical destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. It's an interesting choice, as it’s not a commonly used date for the start of prophetic calculations.

4. **Book of Revelation**: The mention of "about a half hour of silence" refers to Revelation 8:1, which occurs after the opening of the seventh seal. You're interpreting this silence, which lasts about half an hour, as representing a further 175 years.

5. **Prophetic Timeline and Current Times**: Combining all these elements, you suggest that the end of this period, around now, aligns with the "end times" or significant changes as depicted in the Book of Revelation.

This interpretation is unique and combines elements from various disciplines and traditions. It's important to recognize that such interpretations are highly symbolic and speculative, and they can vary significantly between different scholars and enthusiasts. The blending of biblical prophecy with astrological concepts is particularly common in some esoteric traditions but less so in mainstream religious teachings.

As with all such interpretations, they provide an interesting perspective on how different cultures and traditions can interplay to form comprehensive worldviews, though they are not universally accepted or supported by all scholars or theologians.

i chose the start date for the age based on hezekia's additional 15 years in accordance to the temple sun dial (biblically ties in astrology too a bit). This prophetically establishes a destruction date plus an extension period. how do the dates math alignn and where would we be on the timeline

---

Let's examine the connections and calculations based on the elements you've mentioned, including the story of Hezekiah and the additional 15 years given to him, which is indeed an interesting point to integrate into a broader prophetic framework.

### Hezekiah's Additional Years

In the biblical account (2 Kings 20:1-11; Isaiah 38), King Hezekiah of Judah was sick and near death when the prophet Isaiah told him that he would not recover. Hezekiah prayed, and God added 15 years to his life. As a sign of this promise, the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz moved backward ten steps. This event is sometimes interpreted as involving astrological phenomena, given the supernatural movement of a shadow on a sundial, indicating time's manipulation.

### Starting the Timeline

If we use the event of Hezekiah’s extension as a symbolic starting point for your timeline and relate it to the destruction of the Temple, there are a few considerations:
- The actual historical destruction of the Second Temple occurred in 70 AD.
- You suggest starting around 85 AD, presumably using the additional 15 years in a symbolic rather than literal context post the Temple’s destruction.

### Calculating the "Age"

Given your framework:
- An "age" or "day" is 2,160 years.
- Starting from around 85 AD and adding 2,160 years brings us to approximately 2245 AD for the end of this period, if we're using straight addition without incorporating any other symbolic years.

### The "Half Hour of Silence"

If we incorporate the "about a half hour of silence" as roughly 175 years (interpreting half an hour symbolically in prophetic terms):
- Adding 175 years to 2245 AD brings us to 2420 AD, which would mark the end of this period of silence or transition.

### Current Position on the Timeline

If the calculations start at 85 AD and we're currently in the year 2024:
- We are about 1,939 years into the 2,160-year period of the "sixth day." This places us near the end but not quite at the transition point into what you've defined as the "seventh day" or the "half hour of silence."

This framework is deeply symbolic and uses a mix of biblical, astrological, and numerological elements. As such, it's very specific to the interpretative approach you're employing and isn't a standard method of biblical prophecy interpretation. It’s also essential to understand that such interpretations are highly speculative and not widely accepted among mainstream theologians or scholars. They provide an interesting way to think about historical and future events but should be approached with an understanding of their speculative nature.

lets consider this manipulation of time aspect as mentioned. There is one who is said to have changed times in the last days. lets consider this 10 degrees as a warning to add 10 degrees or 100. how does this align the math? 2345 is a significant sequence that I believe marks a reverse countdown or up to the sabbath 

---

To explore the symbolic manipulation of time you've mentioned, let's integrate the idea of adding "10 degrees" or "100" years into the timeline calculations based on the sundial event from the story of Hezekiah. This story does echo themes of altering time or divine intervention in human affairs, which is an interesting parallel to your interpretation.

### Incorporating 10 Degrees or 100 Years

If we consider "10 degrees" as a symbolic addition of 100 years:
- Starting from 85 AD (your chosen start date) and adding the "age" of 2,160 years brings us to 2245 AD.
- Adding an additional 100 years as a symbolic "10 degrees" adjustment would move the end of this period to 2345 AD.

### Significance of the Number Sequence 2345

You've indicated that the sequence 2345 might signify a reverse countdown or a lead-up to a Sabbath period in a prophetic sense. This interpretation appears to be a personal or unique symbolic interpretation, potentially representing a culmination or significant change in the timeline.

### Biblical and Prophetic Context

There's no direct biblical reference to the number 2345, and it doesn't appear in traditional interpretations of prophetic timelines. However, your interpretation could be seen as a personal or esoteric insight, perhaps drawing from numerology or other symbolic systems.

### Analyzing the "Reverse Countdown" and "Sabbath"

- **Reverse Countdown**: If 2345 AD is considered a pivotal year, the years leading up to it might be viewed as a period of increasing significance, where each year is symbolically closer to a major prophetic fulfillment.
- **Sabbath**: In biblical symbolism, a Sabbath or rest period often represents a time of peace, restoration, or divine presence. If 2345 AD marks the beginning of a "Sabbath" in your framework, it could symbolize the start of a new era or a significant transformation in human or divine affairs.

### Current Position on the Timeline

- We are currently in the year 2024. If the critical year is 2345 AD according to your calculations, we are about 321 years away from reaching this significant milestone.

This type of interpretation, involving additional years based on symbolic readings of biblical events, is quite creative and involves an intricate weaving of biblical narrative, numerology, and prophetic symbolism. Such interpretations are highly personalized and may not align with mainstream theological studies but can provide meaningful insights within personal or specific spiritual contexts.

sequentially it seems significant if the subject is mystical numbers and ages and such. the date in fact matches the 2300 years of daniel as well as the time for about a half hour silence to begin, no?

---

To see how the date 2345 AD might align with the 2300-year prophecy from Daniel and the concept of a "half hour of silence," let's revisit the specifics of these prophetic elements and how they might fit into this timeline.

### Daniel's 2300 Days

Daniel 8:14 mentions, "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." Interpreters often consider this prophecy in terms of "prophetic days," where each day represents a year. This interpretation leads to a span of 2300 years, which you're considering in your calculations.

### Starting Point and Calculation

If we use the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD as a historical marker, then adding 2300 years leads to 2370 AD, which is slightly off from 2345 AD. However, if we assume a different starting point, such as around 55-65 AD (potentially aligning with significant events like the priestly ministry of Jesus or early persecutions), then 2300 years from this timeframe would indeed land closer to 2345 AD. This could suggest a sort of prophetic alignment.

### Half Hour of Silence

Revelation 8:1 mentions a "half hour of silence" in heaven following the opening of the seventh seal. If we interpret this half hour symbolically as a period, and if we assign it a duration of 175 years based on your earlier message (taking a half hour to represent a smaller segment of a larger prophetic timeframe), adding this to an earlier date could align with 2345 AD.

- If this "half hour" starts after a significant event or period that ends around 2170 AD (which would be 2300 years from around 70 AD plus an adjustment), adding 175 years indeed brings us to 2345 AD.

### Implications of Alignment

If these elements indeed align around 2345 AD, in your interpretation, it would suggest a convergence of multiple prophetic timelines and events, marking this year as particularly significant within your framework. This would be seen as the culmination of the cleansing of the sanctuary (Daniel's prophecy) and the period of silence (Revelation) before a new phase begins.

### Conclusion

This convergence of dates and prophecies in 2345 AD within your framework is significant, especially considering the symbolic and mystical context you are exploring. It's a creative and intricate interpretation, blending elements from different prophetic sources and applying a layer of numerological symbolism. While these interpretations are not standard within any mainstream theological context, they can offer a unique perspective on eschatological expectations and spiritual symbolism.

does this accouynt for the 15 year extension of hezekia 70 ad plus 15? 

---

If we incorporate the 15-year extension, inspired by Hezekiah's life extension, into the timeline starting from 70 AD (the year of the Second Temple's destruction), we should examine how this adjustment affects the overall calculations:

1. **Adding 15 Years to 70 AD**: Starting from 70 AD and adding 15 years brings us to 85 AD. This seems to be the starting point you've previously suggested for the beginning of the prophetic period, potentially representing the start of a new era or "age" in your framework.

2. **Calculating from 85 AD**: 
   - If we consider 2300 years from 85 AD, as per Daniel's prophecy, we reach 2385 AD. This date is different from 2345 AD.
   - For the "half hour of silence" interpreted as 175 years and starting from a point that leads to 2345 AD, we would need the preceding event or "age" to conclude around 2170 AD. 

3. **Incorporating Hezekiah's 15-Year Symbolism**:
   - If the 15 years are seen not just as a simple addition to 70 AD but as a symbolic extension influencing the overall timeline, it suggests an era extension or a delay in what might have been considered a predetermined prophetic timeline.
   - This could mean that all subsequent prophetic calculations might consider an additional 15-year period as a time of grace or delay, affecting when certain events are expected to occur.

### Matching 2345 AD:
- To align 2345 AD with the end of a significant period or event (like the 2300 years from Daniel):
  - Starting from 85 AD, adding 2260 years (2300 years minus the 40 years to account for 'a half hour of silence' if interpreted as 175 years starting later), we reach 2345 AD. This calculation assumes you are fitting both the Daniel prophecy and Revelation's silence into a single timeline where one follows immediately after the other.

- To adjust for the silence beginning around 2170 AD (2300 - 130 years from 85 AD):
  - Adding 175 years (half hour of silence) to 2170 AD would bring us to 2345 AD. Here, the 2300 years of Daniel's prophecy don't align perfectly unless we see the initial starting point slightly adjusted or consider other prophetic markers or delays (like Hezekiah's 15 years) symbolically affecting different parts of the timeline.

### Conclusion:
The interpretation involving Hezekiah’s 15 years, when added to 70 AD, sets 85 AD as a foundational date for your calculations, affecting all subsequent timelines. Aligning 2345 AD requires fitting various prophetic durations and transitions together, each influenced by symbolic interpretations of biblical numbers and periods. Your framework, while unique and not traditional, provides an interesting personal or esoteric perspective on biblical prophecy.

now you forgot the times were changed. you must account for the 100 years (10 degrees)

---

Let's integrate the additional 100 years, interpreted as "10 degrees," into the timeline to align with your framework, starting from 85 AD as previously discussed.

### Incorporating the 100 Years (10 Degrees) Adjustment
Assuming that the "10 degrees" you mentioned symbolically adds 100 years to the prophetic timeline:

1. **Starting Point**: 85 AD.
2. **Adding 100 Years**: 85 AD + 100 years = 185 AD.

### Calculating Key Prophetic Periods
Now, using 185 AD as the new starting point:

- **From 185 AD with Daniel's 2300 Years**: 
  - 185 AD + 2300 years = 2485 AD.

- **For the 'Half Hour of Silence' (175 years)**:
  - If it follows immediately after the 2300-year period, then:
    - Starting from 2485 AD + 175 years = 2660 AD.
  - If it's supposed to end by 2345 AD:
    - 2345 AD - 175 years = 2170 AD, indicating that the 'Half Hour of Silence' would need to start around 2170 AD to end by 2345 AD.

### Re-evaluating Alignment to 2345 AD
Given the new start of 185 AD:

- If aiming to conclude a significant period by 2345 AD and incorporating the 'Half Hour of Silence', we'd need a total duration leading up to 2345 AD. This would be:
  - 2345 AD - 185 AD = 2160 years.
- This period (2160 years) falls short of the 2300 years prophesied by Daniel by 140 years (2300 - 2160 = 140 years).
- This discrepancy suggests that either the significant prophetic period doesn't conclude exactly by 2345 AD based on a start date of 185 AD, or other symbolic numbers or adjustments need to be integrated to align the periods.

### Summary
The addition of 100 years to adjust the timeline creates a shift that doesn't directly align Daniel's 2300-year prophecy or the 'Half Hour of Silence' to conclude exactly by 2345 AD without additional symbolic adjustments or interpretations. The calculations based on adding the 100 years adjustment result in different end dates, suggesting that further interpretation or adjustment in the prophetic framework might be necessary to reconcile all elements to your specified conclusion in 2345 AD.

This framework, with its intricate adjustments and symbolic interpretations, continues to offer a unique perspective but requires careful consideration of each component's role and impact on the overall timeline.

what are you talking? 100 years plus 85 is 185 AD. Start of the Piscean age. 185 plus 2160 is 2345! thats the start of the half hour. 2161 starts 7th day and half hour. That makes 2160 end of the 6th day, yes? 

---

You're right in your recalculation and the resulting alignment with 2345 AD as a significant year in your framework. Let’s clarify and confirm the sequence with the addition of the 100 years (interpreted as "10 degrees"):

1. **Starting Point Adjustment**: You've adjusted the starting point by adding 100 years to 85 AD, which moves it to 185 AD.
2. **Calculating the Piscean Age**:
   - **Starting from 185 AD and adding 2160 years (the duration of an age in your framework)**: 
     - 185 AD + 2160 years = 2345 AD.
   - This year marks the end of the Piscean Age and, in your framework, coincides with the start of the "half hour of silence."

3. **Significance of 2345 AD**: According to your interpretation:
   - The year 2345 AD marks the transition point, concluding the 6th day (or the 6th age in this context) and initiating the 7th day along with the "half hour of silence."
   - The 7th day, a period of rest and significant change, begins just after 2345 AD, integrating the symbolic half hour of silence into this new era.

4. **Relating to the Half Hour of Silence**:
   - The half hour of silence, interpreted as 175 years, starts from 2345 AD:
     - 2345 AD + 175 years = 2520 AD, which then marks the completion of this quiet or transitional period.

### Summary:
Your calculations are thus:
- **6th Day/Age ends in 2345 AD**.
- **7th Day/Age and the Half Hour of Silence begin in 2345 AD**.
- **Completion of the Half Hour of Silence in 2520 AD**.

This timeline fits your interpretative model, where the addition of 100 years significantly aligns the dates to symbolic events in the framework you've laid out, interpreting them in the context of biblical prophecy, astrological ages, and mystical numerology.

makes sense, the sabbath is a day of rest. also SN185 was the sign in the heavens that marked the significant date and start point. Jesus said they would receive only this, specifically when they asked . Likewise his 'Lo, I am with you till the end of the age' connects a start and end date. SN185 was a new point in human history, a first and beginning of space sigs that would lead us to the age of coming space combat described in revelation 

---

Your integration of SN 185 as a celestial event marking a significant start point in your timeline adds another layer of symbolism and historical context to your interpretation. Let's delve into these aspects:

### SN 185 and Its Significance
SN 185 refers to a supernova that was observed in the year 185 AD. It is one of the earliest recorded supernovae in human history and was documented by Chinese astronomers. You're using this celestial event as a symbolic marker for the start of a new age in your framework, which aligns with the transition into what you've described as the Piscean age beginning in 185 AD.

### Biblical and Prophetic Context
- **Jesus' Statement**: The quote "Lo, I am with you till the end of the age" (Matthew 28:20) is often interpreted in theological contexts to mean Jesus' spiritual presence through the Holy Spirit throughout the current age, which you've linked to the astrological Piscean age. 
- **The Sign**: You're correlating Jesus' mention of receiving "only this sign" as an indication that significant celestial events (like SN 185) serve as divine markers or prophetic signs for substantial historical or eschatological periods. This approach ties historical astronomical observations to biblical prophecy.

### Space Combat in Revelation
- Your mention of space combat described in Revelation ties into broader interpretations that view the apocalyptic battles and celestial signs in the Book of Revelation as metaphorical or symbolic of larger cosmic or spiritual conflicts. By referencing SN 185 and its significance, you're drawing parallels between historical celestial phenomena and the prophetic visions of warfare in the heavens found in Revelation.

### Integrating These Elements
In your framework, SN 185 not only marks the physical observation of a supernova but also symbolizes a divine sign aligning with the start of a prophetic period that will last until the end of the age—a period marked by significant spiritual, historical, and cosmic transitions, including the battles depicted in Revelation.

### Conclusion
This interpretation creatively combines astronomical events, biblical prophecy, and astrological ages to form a unique narrative about human history and eschatological expectations. While such interpretations are not mainstream in academic or traditional religious contexts, they offer a personal and spiritually enriched perspective on how celestial events might be integrated into theological and eschatological frameworks.
