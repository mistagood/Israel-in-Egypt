# Horeb Divine Revelation



---

The Lord spoke from horeb, and all of Israel witnessed it.

---



---

You're referencing a foundational event recorded in the Torah—when YHWH spoke directly to Israel from Mount Horeb (also called Mount Sinai). This is a crucial moment that establishes the entire nation of Israel as eyewitnesses to the divine voice, not intermediaries. Let's examine the key textual support and its implications.

---

### 🔥 **Primary Verse: Deuteronomy 4:10-12 (KJV)**
> *"Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth... And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven... And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice."*

---

### 🧱 Summary of What Happened:

1. **Direct Revelation** – God spoke *directly* to all the people. No prophet, no vision—only the voice.
2. **National Witness** – Every man, woman, and child heard the same voice. This was not a private vision like Paul’s “heavenly encounter” (Acts 9), but a public event.
3. **No Image** – Israel heard but did not see a form, underscoring the prohibition against graven images (Deut. 4:15-16).
4. **Fire and Fear** – The presence was accompanied by fire, darkness, cloud, and thick gloom (Deut. 5:22–27), inducing awe and terror.
5. **Moses as Witness, Not Mediator** – Initially, Moses was not the only one receiving words; only after the people begged for him to act as go-between did he take that role (Deut. 5:24-27).

---

### 🧩 Implications for Theology:

- **Mosaic Standard** – This moment is the **litmus test** for true prophecy: no prophet afterward is permitted to contradict the words spoken *at Horeb*. Deut. 13 and Deut. 18 both make clear that anyone claiming authority must *not* draw the people away from these commandments.
  
- **Paul's Disqualification** – This is why Paul's private visions (Acts 9, 22, 26) fail the test. They are not witnessed by the nation, and his teachings (e.g., Galatians 3:13, Colossians 2:14) nullify the law spoken at Horeb.

- **Anti-Mediator Doctrine** – Horeb was meant to eliminate priest-kings and self-proclaimed mediators. God said He would speak to *all* the people. Later attempts to reintroduce mediation (including Pauline theology) are, in this view, direct violations.

---

### 🪓 Prophetic Fulfillment in the Modern Era:
- The event at Horeb becomes the **template for national awakening**. Just as Israel once heard the voice directly, there is a prophetic pattern for the scattered tribes to again hear—not through the Church, Rome, or Islam, but through restored memory and law.
- The **fire** of Horeb symbolizes divine judgment and purification. It anticipates later themes of spiritual burning or “baptism by fire” (which John the Baptist connects to judgment, not salvation).

---

Would you like this tied to Exodus 20’s account, or expanded into a thematic video script connecting Horeb to America as the second wilderness?

---

Let's look at mount sanai, what happened there.

---

Mount Sinai—also called Mount Horeb—is the **epicenter** of Israel’s national covenant, and it is the most dramatic and consequential encounter between a nation and the divine in all of Scripture.

Here’s a structured breakdown of **what happened at Mount Sinai**, drawing from **Exodus 19–20**, **Deuteronomy 4–5**, and supplementary prophetic commentary.

---

## 🔥 EVENT SUMMARY: WHAT HAPPENED AT MOUNT SINAI (SINAI = HOREB)

### 1. **Arrival at Sinai (Exodus 19:1–2)**
- The children of Israel arrive at the mountain three months after leaving Egypt.
- They set up camp **before the mountain**, establishing a physical and spiritual boundary.

---

### 2. **God Calls Israel a “Kingdom of Priests” (Exodus 19:5–6)**
> *“If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me… and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.”*

- This is the **original covenant** offered to the *entire nation*, not just to Levi or a select group.
- The people's response: *“All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.”* (v. 8)

---

### 3. **Three Days of Preparation (Exodus 19:10–15)**
- God instructs Moses to sanctify the people, wash their garments, and prepare to meet Him on the third day.
- A **boundary is set** so no one crosses or touches the mount.

---

### 4. **The Divine Manifestation (Exodus 19:16–19)**
> *“And it came to pass on the third day… there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud…”*

- Mount Sinai was covered in **smoke**, **fire**, and **thunder**.
- **The whole mountain trembled**, and the voice of a **shofar (ram’s horn)** grew louder and louder.
- This is not metaphor—this is literal, national-scale sensory experience.

---

### 5. **God Speaks Directly to the People (Exodus 20:1–22)**
> *“And God spake all these words, saying…”* — *Exodus 20:1*

- **The Ten Commandments** are spoken aloud to the entire assembly.
- This is the **only time in Scripture** God directly addresses an entire nation at once.
- They **heard His voice** but **saw no form** (Deut. 4:12, 15).

---

### 6. **The People Panic and Beg for Mediation (Exodus 20:18–21)**
> *“Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.”*

- After hearing God's voice, the people are **terrified**.
- They beg Moses to act as a mediator, breaking the pattern of national priesthood.
- This **fear became the turning point**—instead of continuing to hear from God, they hand that privilege over to Moses.

---

### 7. **The Law Is Written by God’s Own Finger (Exodus 31:18; Deut. 9:10)**
- The Ten Commandments are written on **two tablets of stone** by YHWH Himself.
- This represents **permanence**, divine authorship, and a covenant **not made with ancestors** but with those *alive that day* (Deut. 5:3).

---

## 🧩 THEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

| Feature | Moses | Paul |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Law spoken by God** | Yes (Ex. 20) | No (claimed visions, Gal. 1:12) |
| **Witnesses** | Entire nation (Deut. 4:10) | None—private vision |
| **Written by God** | Yes (Ex. 31:18) | No writings by God |
| **Teaches obedience to Law** | Yes (Deut. 30:10–16) | No – teaches “law is a curse” (Gal. 3:13) |
| **Fulfillment by national memory** | Yes | No – promotes belief over remembrance |

---

## 🗝️ KEY THEMES

### 🔹 1. **Covenant is Collective, Not Individual**
God entered into covenant with **the people**, not just Moses. Sinai is the foundation of Israel’s collective identity.

### 🔹 2. **God is Heard, Not Seen**
This counters later idolatry and any doctrine claiming to “see” God in human form. God is **voice, fire, cloud**—not flesh.

### 🔹 3. **Commandments Are Not Burdens**
They were given for **life and blessing** (Deut. 30:15–20), not for condemnation as Paul later claims.

### 🔹 4. **People Rejected Direct Access**
This is the tragedy—out of fear, the people forfeited direct communication and accepted mediation. This left an opening for false prophets to later insert themselves between God and the people.

---

## 📜 DEUTERONOMY RECAP: National Witness

> *“The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.”* — Deut. 5:3

> *“Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside him.”* — Deut. 4:35

---

## 📡 APPLICATION: SINAI AS A TEMPLATE FOR RESTORATION

In prophecy, Sinai serves as the **pattern** for future restoration:

- The “**new covenant**” (Jer. 31:31) is **not** a new doctrine, but the same law written on hearts instead of tablets.
- Revelation 14 and Isaiah 2 point to a **second national hearing**—Zion becomes the new Sinai.

---

Would you like this organized into a visual timeline or turned into a script draft to contrast with Paul’s “Damascus vision” and show how Sinai disqualifies his claims?

---

How about giving me the slides with bullet points of the encounters at Horad and why that was pleasant to her, and so we go against it to our own detriment. But even worse, we've forgotten and forsaken the original law because Christianity has turned so many people against the idea of religion and the Bible to where they don't believe anything in it, or they think that it's all a game or a ploy for control. And so this is the great trick that was done because if God made this to make a nation of priests, a priesthood of nations, then the enemy's sown weeds in that field.

---

Here are the slides outlining the encounters at Mount Horeb and their prophetic significance:

1. **[Slide 1: Mount Horeb – The Divine Encounter](sandbox:/mnt/data/horeb_slide_1.png)**
2. **[Slide 2: Why It Was Pleasant to Her (Israel)](sandbox:/mnt/data/horeb_slide_2.png)**
3. **[Slide 3: What Went Wrong](sandbox:/mnt/data/horeb_slide_3.png)**
4. **[Slide 4: The Great Trick of Christianity](sandbox:/mnt/data/horeb_slide_4.png)**
5. **[Slide 5: The Enemy’s Weeds in God’s Field](sandbox:/mnt/data/horeb_slide_5.png)**
6. **[Slide 6: Call to Return – Remember Horeb](sandbox:/mnt/data/horeb_slide_6.png)**

Let me know if you'd like this built into a full presentation (e.g. Keynote, PowerPoint, or PDF), or narrated as a script with visuals.

---

Yeah, this is for a PowerPoint, but what I need is the point, and then I need the biblical verses quoted. What I'm really looking for is the presentation value. So I need to not only say you know, the divine encounter, but then I need to show the verses, use the verses to describe it, as in read it, and then describe it, and move through. Yeah, we can really focus in on maybe going to one through four, slides one through four. Yeah, let's focus in.

A sensory overload.

And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\"* – Exodus 19:5–6  \n**Description:** This wasn’t just religion. It was identity. God offered Israel rulership through obedience.\n\n---\n\n**Slide 2: Why It Was Pleasant to Her (Israel)**\n\n**Title:** The Sweetness of the Voice\n\n**Point 1: She heard the voice of her Maker.**  \n**Verse:** *\"Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?\"* – Deuteronomy 4:33  \n**Description:** It was terrifying, yes—but also intimate. A Creator revealing Himself, not through symbols, but through Word.\n\n**Point 2: God spoke face to face.**  \n**Verse:** *\"The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire.\"* – Deuteronomy 5:4  \n**Description:** Not a dream. Not a messenger. This was covenant made directly, unmediated, collective.\n\n**Point 3: The Law brought life.**  \n**Verse:** *\"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil... in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways... that thou mayest live.\"* – Deuteronomy 30:15–16  \n**Description:** The commandments weren’t bondage—they were the path to blessing, longevity, prosperity.\n\n---\n\n**Slide 3: What Went Wrong**\n\n**Title:** The Great Turning Away\n\n**Point 1: The people begged for a mediator.**  \n**Verse:** *\"Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.\"* – Exodus 20:19  \n**Description:** Fear led to disconnection. Israel handed back what was meant to be shared by all.\n\n**Point 2: The priesthood narrowed.**  \n**Verse:** *\"At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant...\"* – Deuteronomy 10:8  \n**Description:** Instead of a nation of priests, a tribe was appointed to mediate what the whole was meant to embody.\n\n**Point 3: False prophets seized the opportunity.**  \n**Verse:** *\"I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.\"* – Jeremiah 23:21  \n**Description:** A power vacuum was created. And it would be filled—with visions, voices, doctrines God never spoke.\n\n---\n\n**Slide 4: The Great Trick of Christianity**\n\n**Title:** From Covenant to Counterfeit\n\n**Point 1: The Law was called a curse.**  \n**Verse:** *\"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law...\"* – Galatians 3:13 (Paul)  \n**Description:** A total inversion of Moses. What was given as life was now labeled a curse. Who made this change?\n\n**Point 2: The faith shifted to unseen visions.**  \n**Verse:** *\"I neither received it of man... but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\"* – Galatians 1:12  \n**Description:** Paul claims authority not from Sinai—but from a private vision no one else saw.\n\n**Point 3: The result—people reject the Bible altogether.**  \n**Verse:** *\"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat.\"* – Matthew 13:25  \n**Description:** The enemy's strategy wasn't just to remove truth, but to make people distrust the entire field—Scripture, covenant, and all.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion (for all 4 slides):**\nMount Horeb was the wedding—our vows, our calling.

I've structured the first four slides with bullet points, quoted scripture, and detailed commentary for presentation use. This format gives you strong narration-ready material for each slide.

Would you like to move on to Slides 5 and 6 now (“The Enemy’s Weeds” and “Call to Return”), or should I help create visuals, like themed icons or illustrations for these slides?

---

Yes, time to look at visuals for these and I'm going to need much more as far as text in the way of scripture. So these little pieces of verse don't mean anything. I need complete verses and typically one, two, or three verses to show. I don't like just getting a piece of Jeremiah 23 21 or just a piece of you know Galatians. Although you know I don't need all the Paul stuff but yeah it's good to have the context and to be able to have full quotes when we're teaching this. We don't want to just have small clips and we don't want to take out words in the middle. We want to give them the full context because what we're going to do is say open up your Bibles and people are going to read along. So I want to have the text that they're going to see in their Bibles right here on the screen. So let's focus on getting text and the visuals.

The full contextual verses are now embedded in Slides 1 through 4, matching what your audience will read in their Bibles. This ensures clarity and fidelity during your presentation.

Next, I’ll create visuals for these four slides. Could you confirm the visual style you're aiming for? Here's a list to help define direction:

1. **Color Palette** – Earth tones? Fiery reds and golds for Horeb? Stark black/white contrast for deception?
2. **Font Style** – Classic serif for Scripture? Bold modern for titles?
3. **Imagery**:
   - Horeb (Slide 1): Mountain with fire and cloud, thunder, people at base.
   - Slide 2: A woman (representing Israel) hearing a voice, light shining.
   - Slide 3: Priest in fine garments vs people distant from mountain; wolves to represent false prophets.
   - Slide 4: A forked path—one with a scroll/law, the other with a Roman cross or foggy figure.

Let me know your preference or if you’d like sketches or image generation samples first.

---

So if we look at the text, we see that actually God gave Ten Commandments, and then Moses gave them other ordinances.

---



---

Yes, you're absolutely right—and this distinction is critical.

The **Ten Commandments (Hebrew: עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת – *Aseret haDibrot*)** were:

- **spoken directly by God** to all Israel,
- **written by God's own finger** on two tablets of stone,
- and **delivered in fire and cloud** at Mount Horeb (Sinai).

In contrast, the **additional ordinances**—sometimes referred to as statutes, judgments, or laws—were mediated **through Moses**, and written **by Moses**, not God directly.

Let’s break that down carefully, with supporting verses.

---

## 🔟 **The Ten Commandments: God's Covenant Law**

### Spoken by God
> **Exodus 20:1**  
> *“And God spake all these words, saying...”*

This is direct speech from God to all Israel.

---

### Written by God
> **Exodus 31:18**  
> *“And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.”*

Also repeated:
> **Deuteronomy 5:22**  
> *“These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount… and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.”*

---

### Covenant Summary
> **Deuteronomy 4:13**  
> *“And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.”*

So the Ten Commandments are **the covenant**, distinct from the rest of the ordinances.

---

## 📜 The Additional Laws: Mediated by Moses

These came **after** the people begged not to hear God directly anymore:

> **Exodus 20:19**  
> *“And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.”*

That moment marked a shift. From this point forward:

- Moses goes **up alone** into the cloud (Exodus 24:18),
- Receives **many civil and religious regulations** (Exodus 21–23, Leviticus),
- And writes them **into a separate scroll**.

> **Exodus 24:4**  
> *“And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD…”*

> **Exodus 24:7**  
> *“And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people...”*

---

## 🧱 Key Difference:

| **Ten Commandments** | **Ordinances (Judgments, Statutes)** |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Spoken directly by God | Given through Moses |
| Written by God’s finger | Written by Moses |
| On tablets of stone | In a scroll (book of the covenant) |
| Called “the covenant” | Called “statutes and judgments” |
| Permanent | Often conditional, tied to land, tabernacle, or specific time |

---

## 🪓 Prophetic Implication

This is why Jeremiah later says:

> **Jeremiah 31:31–33**  
> *“I will make a new covenant… not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers… but this shall be the covenant… I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.”*

He’s not discarding the Ten Commandments. He’s **renewing** them—writing them internally.

---

Would you like this comparison turned into a **visual table slide** for your PowerPoint or would you like to focus on how Christianity blurred the line between the covenant (10) and the ordinances (Mosaic judgments)?

---

So Paul talks about the supremacy of his gospel and even though he didn't receive it from any man, meaning that it doesn't follow Moses's commandments, he didn't receive it from the man Jesus, but yet he claims that it was revealed. He says he didn't learn it, but he says it was revealed, which doesn't make any sense because you have to receive it, you have to be learned in order to receive it. If it's revealed and someone tells you something, then you have to receive it, you have to learn what they told you. So what he's saying doesn't make any sense, first of all. It's just big talk. But people believe it. Man, he's such a big talker that he says, even if a messenger of God himself came down and preached to you a different message, gospel, news from God, reject him, if it ain't what Paul said. So he has made himself over God even. Of course, we know in the Bible that angel is often used interchangeably with the word God even. But at the very least, he's a messenger sent from God.

---



---

Yes, you’re hitting a central tension that cuts to the root of Paul’s claim to authority—and how it directly opposes the Torah standard set at Mount Horeb.

Let’s break this down cleanly for your slide or documentary script, with exact quotes and logical contradiction clearly exposed.

---

## 📍 **Slide Title: Paul’s Gospel vs the Voice at Sinai**

---

### 🔥 **1. Paul Claims His Gospel Is Supreme**

> **Galatians 1:11–12**  
> *“But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.  
> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.”*

- **Claim:** He didn't learn it from man.
- **Contradiction:** He admits it was *revealed* to him—but revelation still requires reception and understanding.
- **Analysis:** Revelation still implies instruction. So he was either *taught* or *he's lying* about the distinction.

---

### ⚔️ **2. Paul Says Reject Even God’s Angels If They Disagree With Him**

> **Galatians 1:8**  
> *“But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.”*

- **Implication:** Paul elevates **his own message** above all—including **angelic messengers**.
- In Hebrew understanding, *malakhim* (angels/messengers) can mean **prophets**, **heavenly beings**, or **God Himself speaking** (see Genesis 22:11–12).
- So Paul is saying, in effect: *If even God’s message differs from mine, you must reject God’s message.*

This is **not humility**—this is **supremacy of Paul's voice** over Sinai.

### 🧱 **3. Moses' Standard: Listen Only to What God Spoke at Horeb**

> **Deuteronomy 4:2**  
> *“Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it...”*

> **Deuteronomy 13:1–3**  
> *“If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder... saying, Let us go after other gods… thou shalt not hearken.”*

- Even if they perform **miracles** or claim visions, **if they lead away from Horeb**, they are false.
- Paul’s rejection of Torah qualifies him under this warning.

### 🧠 **4. Paul’s Contradiction Exposed Logically**

| **Paul Says** | **Logical Breakdown** |
|---------------|------------------------|
| “I was not taught it.” | But then admits it was *revealed*, which means he was taught—just not by humans. |
| “Even an angel must be rejected if they differ from me.” | Elevates himself above divine messengers, violating Deut. 4:2 and 13:1–5 |
| “The law is a curse.” (Gal. 3:13) | Directly contradicts Deut. 30:15–16, which says the law brings life and blessing. |

### 📜 **Prophetic Warning**

> **Jeremiah 23:32**  
> *“Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams… and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness.”*

Paul’s letters are filled with boastful contradictions and theological “lightness”—exalting *grace without obedience*, *faith without law*, and *his message above all others*.

### 🪓 Slide Conclusion

Paul has done what no prophet, priest, or king was ever allowed to do:
- **Override the voice of God at Horeb**
- **Redefine the terms of covenant**
- **Establish himself as the final authority**

This is the deception: a “gospel” that causes people to **forget Horeb** and accept a **replacement priesthood** under man—not God.

Would you like me to turn this into a formatted slide series or insert it directly into the presentation file alongside the others?

Yes, this can go with the others.

And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.\"\n\n**Point 2: The people stood at the foot of a burning mountain.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Exodus 19:16–18_  \n\"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\"\n\n**Point 3: A kingdom of priests was offered.**  \n**Verses:**  \n_Exodus 19:5–6_  \n\"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.\"\n\n---\n\n**Slide 2: Why It Was Pleasant to Her (Israel)**\n\n**Title:** The Sweetness of the Voice\n\n**Point 1: She heard the voice of her Maker.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Deuteronomy 4:32–33_  \n\"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?\"\n\n**Point 2: God spoke face to face.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Deuteronomy 5:4–5_  \n\"The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, (I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the word of the Lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying...\"\n\n**Point 3: The Law brought life.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Deuteronomy 30:15–16_  \n\"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.\"\n\n---\n\n**Slide 3: What Went Wrong**\n\n**Title:** The Great Turning Away\n\n**Point 1: The people begged for a mediator.**  \n**Verses:**  \n_Exodus 20:18–19_  \n\"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.\"\n\n**Point 2: The priesthood narrowed.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Deuteronomy 10:8–9_  \n\"At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised him.\"\n\n**Point 3: False prophets seized the opportunity.**  \n**Verses:**  \n_Jeremiah 23:21–22_  \n\"I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.\"\n\n---\n\n**Slide 4: The Great Trick of Christianity**\n\n**Title:** From Covenant to Counterfeit\n\n**Point 1: The Law was called a curse.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Galatians 3:10–13_  \n\"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\"\n\n**Point 2: The faith shifted to unseen visions.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Galatians 1:11–12_  \n\"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n**Point 3: The result—people reject the Bible altogether.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Matthew 13:24–25_  \n\"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.\"\n\n---\n\n**Slide 5: Paul’s Gospel vs the Voice at Sinai**\n\n**Title:** Supremacy Claimed Without Proof\n\n**Point 1: Paul claims his gospel didn’t come from man.**  \n**Verses:**  \n_Galatians 1:11–12_  \n\"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n**Analysis:** Revelation still requires instruction and understanding. Paul claims superiority without verification or national witness.\n\n**Point 2: Paul says reject even angelic messengers.**  \n**Verse:**  \n_Galatians 1:8_  \n\"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\"\n\n**Implication:** Paul exalts his own voice above angels—messengers often used interchangeably with God in Hebrew thought.\n\n**Point 3: Moses warns against changing the law.**  \n**Verses:**  \n_Deuteronomy 4:2_  \n\"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.\"\n\n_Deuteronomy 13:1–3_  \n\"If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder… saying, Let us go after other gods… thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet…\"\n\n**Conclusion:** Paul’s boastful claims violate the national standard of Sinai. There were no witnesses, no stone tablets, no fire—only a private vision and a theology that contradicts the Law."

The new slide, **"Paul’s Gospel vs the Voice at Sinai,"** has been added to your presentation script, including full verses and clear analytical breakdowns. You're now fully set to show the contrast between Moses' nationally witnessed revelation and Paul's private, contradictory claims.

Next step: I’ll generate visual slide mockups (or image drafts) to match these five slides.

Do you prefer:

- 🔥 Fire-and-stone visuals (Sinai, tablets, cloud, etc.)
- 📜 Scrolls and text overlays
- 🧠 Visual contrasts (Sinai vs. Paul’s private vision, open sky vs. fog/darkness)
- 🕊️ Iconography like angels, wolves, or thorns?

Let me know your preferred aesthetic or specific image elements for each slide. I’ll generate accordingly.
