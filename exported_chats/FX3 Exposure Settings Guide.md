# FX3 Exposure Settings Guide



---

Give me the basic breakdowns on the functions of my fx3 and photography basically because I need to know what the ISO and which functions I need to really pay attention to so there's I know ISO but I think that's like the shutter so you got it only I need a quick tutorial in what the exposure ISO f2 I'm pretty sure I think that's the you know the blur but I want to know what that's called and what controls it and then basically the different options for yeah what the different things are zebra shutter and the things that I need to make this a successful kind of shoot as far as making adjustments

You're shooting with the **Sony FX3**, which is a hybrid cinema camera that can also handle photography. Let’s break down the basics of what you see on your camera’s display and give you a fast but thorough crash course in photography exposure settings:

---

## 🎥 **EXPOSURE TRIANGLE – The Big 3**

These 3 control how bright or dark your image is:

### 1. **Shutter Speed** (`1/6` shown in your image)
- Controls: **Motion blur / light amount**
- Slower = brighter, more blur (good for low light)
- Faster = darker, freezes motion (sports, fast movement)
- Rule of thumb: For handheld photo, use at least `1/60`. For cinema (24fps), use 1/50 or 1/48.

**Your current: `1/6` = very slow** – probably too blurry unless on a tripod (which you are).

---

### 2. **Aperture / F-stop** (`F2.8`)
- Controls: **Depth of field (blur) + light**
- Lower f-number = more background blur (**shallow focus**), more light (good for dark scenes)
- Higher f-number = everything sharper, less light

**Your current: `F2.8` = wide open**, giving you a creamy background blur (great for interviews, portraits)

---

### 3. **ISO** (`ISO 200`)
- Controls: **Sensor sensitivity**
- Low ISO = clean image, less noise
- High ISO = brighter but more grainy

**ISO 200 is great if your lighting is sufficient.** Stay below 3200 for cleaner images unless absolutely needed.

---

## 🔎 OTHER SETTINGS & TERMS

### ✅ **Zebra**
- Shows you what’s **overexposed** (too bright) using striped overlays
- Use it to prevent blown-out highlights on faces
- Set Zebra Level to 70-75 for skin tones

### ✅ **Focus Mode: AF-C**
- AF-C = **Autofocus Continuous** – camera keeps tracking focus on a moving subject (great for video)
- For interviews: switch to **AF-S (Single)** if subject is stationary
- You can use **Focus Mag** button for manual assist (zoom-in to check focus)

### ✅ **Exposure Compensation (`-2.0`)**
- You're currently underexposing by 2 stops
- Adjust toward `0.0` unless you want a stylized dark image

### ✅ **White Balance (AWB A1)**
- AWB = Auto White Balance
- For studio setups, it’s better to **set white balance manually** based on your lighting (use a white card or kelvin temp)

---

## 🎬 VIDEO-SPECIFIC SETTINGS

### ✅ **PP2** (Picture Profile)
- This is a Sony Picture Profile – for better control over grading
- If shooting for editing/post-production, **use S-Log3 (PP8)** with proper exposure (requires experience)
- For easy, straight-out-of-camera footage, **stay with PP1 or PP2**

## 🔧 Settings To Focus On for Clean Interviews

| Setting              | Recommended Value             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Shutter Speed        | `1/50` (if shooting 24fps)     |
| Aperture             | `F2.8`–`F4` for background blur|
| ISO                  | `100–800` (as low as possible) |
| Picture Profile      | PP2 or PP8 (S-Log3)            |
| Zebra                | ON, set to 70–75               |
| Focus Mode           | AF-S for stationary; AF-C for movement |
| White Balance        | Set manually (Kelvin)          |
| Exposure Compensation| `0` unless intentionally styled|

---

## 🎯 Final Tips

- Use a **gray card or white card** to set proper white balance.
- Always **check your histogram** or use Zebra to prevent overexposure.
- Manually set exposure in **Manual (M)** mode for consistency during shoots.
- Use a **ND filter** if your image is too bright at wide apertures in daylight.

Let me know if you want a **video-ready preset** or custom FX3 picture profile tuning suggestions (like Cine EI or S-Cinetone). I can also walk you through color grading or LUT workflows if you're doing post-production.

I'm doing photography right now, so I'm asking specifically about that. Where do I get an ND filter? And what's this gray card or white card? How do I do that? Where is that? And you're talking about this Kelvin, so I don't have that. I also don't have PP8Slog3 on here, so what am I doing about that?

---

Great! Since you're focused on **photography** right now, let’s shift gears and cover exactly what you need to shoot clean, professional-looking **photos** on your **Sony FX3** — and how to get and use the tools you're asking about: ND filters, gray cards, white balance, and Kelvin control.

---

## ✅ PART 1: ND FILTER (Neutral Density Filter)

### 🔍 What It Is:
- Sunglasses for your lens.
- Reduces light **without changing color**, allowing you to shoot at **wide apertures (like f/2.8)** even in **bright daylight** without blowing out the photo.

### 📦 Where to Get It:
- Buy from **B&H, Adorama, Amazon**, or your local camera store.
- You need the **correct diameter** (measured in mm) for your **lens front thread** (it’s marked on the front of your lens, like ⌀67mm or similar).
- Recommended:
  - **Variable ND filter** (adjustable darkness)
  - Brands: Tiffen, PolarPro, Moment, Freewell, or Peter McKinnon/PolarPro VND

### 🛠 How to Use:
- Screw it onto the front of your lens
- Rotate to darken until your exposure is balanced
- Keeps your **f/2.8 look** without overexposure

---

## ✅ PART 2: GRAY CARD / WHITE CARD

### 🔍 What It Is:
- Physical card that helps your camera set **accurate white balance**
- **Gray card (18%)** is standard for exposure + white balance.
- **White card** is used solely for white balance.

### 📦 Where to Get It:
- Amazon: Search for “18% gray card”
- Some options come in **wallet-size**, **foldable**, or **lanyard** versions
- Common brands: WhiBal, DGK, Datacolor SpyderCube, etc.

### 📸 How to Use It:
1. Place the card **in the lighting you’ll be shooting in** (not in the shadows or odd angles).
2. On your FX3:
   - Switch **White Balance** from AWB to **Custom (C1 or C2)**.
   - Select **“Set Custom White Balance”**
   - Fill the frame with the gray card and press the shutter
   - It locks the color temperature for that light.

🎯 Result: Your skin tones and whites look *accurate and natural* with no yellow or blue casts.

## ✅ PART 3: KELVIN TEMPERATURE (White Balance)

### 🔍 What It Is:
- Kelvin (K) = color temperature of the light
- Lower K = warmer (orange), Higher K = cooler (blue)

| Light Source        | Suggested Kelvin |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Candlelight         | ~1800K           |
| Tungsten bulb       | 2800–3200K       |
| Sunrise/sunset      | 3500K            |
| Daylight (shade)    | 5500–6500K       |
| Cloudy/overcast     | 6500–7500K       |
| Studio LED panels   | usually settable |

### 📸 How To Set Kelvin on Sony FX3 (in photo mode):
1. Go to **White Balance settings**
2. Choose **K (Kelvin)** instead of AWB
3. Use the dial to manually pick a temperature (e.g., 5500K for daylight)

**Note:** You may need to **activate advanced WB options in the menu**. If you don’t see Kelvin mode, it's possibly due to your shooting mode. Make sure you're in **Manual (M)** or **Aperture Priority (A)**, not full Auto.

---

## ✅ PART 4: Picture Profiles for PHOTOS

- **Picture Profiles like PP8 and S-Log3 are for video only**, so they don’t matter for stills.
- For photography, what matters is:
  - Your **image profile** (JPG or RAW)
  - Your **Creative Style** setting

### 📷 Recommended:
- **Shoot RAW** for full editing control
- Use “Neutral” or “Portrait” under **Creative Style** if shooting JPGs

To enable RAW:
- Go to Menu > Image Quality > Select “RAW + JPEG” or just “RAW”
