# Genesis Hero Overview

Who is the hero of the book of genesis 

---



---

The true hero of the Book of Genesis isn’t a single man—it’s a bloodline. Genesis is not the tale of one person rising in glory, but the unfolding of a *chosen seed*, a lineage carefully protected, preserved, and positioned for dominion. That seed is first promised in the ashes of Eden—*“the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent’s head”*—a prophetic strike against the serpent’s empire. From that moment, the war is on.

Adam falls, but Seth rises. Cain’s bloodline is cursed, but the righteous bloodline of Shem is guarded. When the world collapses into violence and corruption, it’s Noah—a descendant of that seed—who carries the DNA of deliverance through the flood. But even Noah isn’t the hero. He merely keeps the torch lit.

The focus narrows to one man: Abraham. But not for his power or perfection. Abraham is chosen. Called out. He becomes the prototype of faith-based revolution. He rejects the empire of Babel, the globalist tower, and builds a private altar in the wilderness. This is spiritual warfare. He is promised land, legacy, and *loins* that will birth nations—specifically, a nation that will battle the serpent’s empire until the end.

The book pivots through Isaac, Jacob, and finally Joseph. Joseph rises in Egypt, not just to survive, but to strategically position the family—*the future nation*—to multiply in enemy territory. He isn’t the hero. He is the chess piece. The true hero is the promise. The seed. The divine agenda moving silently through every betrayal, famine, and brotherly feud.

Genesis isn’t about the perfection of its characters. It’s about the perseverance of a plan. A plan to produce a people who would one day destroy the serpent’s kingdom and reclaim dominion.

So who’s the hero?

The hero is *the seed*—and Genesis is its origin story.

---

No, we've got to look at some literary conventions and some genres and determine who the hero is.

---

Got it. Let’s approach this from a *literary* standpoint—analyzing Genesis through narrative conventions, character arcs, and genre elements.

In classical literature, the **hero** is often the central figure whose journey, development, or moral struggle shapes the narrative. They're not always flawless—they may fall, falter, or even deceive—but their actions drive the story forward and reveal deeper truths.

Genesis, as ancient Near Eastern literature, functions both as mythic origin story and theological polemic. It contains several genres: etiological tales (explaining origins), sagas (family and tribal stories), and covenantal drama. So within that frame, let’s look at the contenders:

---

**Adam?**  
The first man. The prototype. But not the hero. He fails in the opening act. His downfall sparks the story, but he fades into the background with shame and silence. He’s more of a tragic figure than a hero.

**Noah?**  
A righteous man in a corrupt age. He survives the flood, saves life on earth. He’s got the structure of a hero—but again, there’s no transformation arc. He obeys, he builds, and then he drinks and curses his grandson. His role is crucial, but his arc ends with ambiguity, not glory.

**Abraham?**  
Now we’re in hero territory. Abraham is *called*, he *journeys*, he faces *tests*, and he makes *covenants*. He leaves behind home and kin, wanders in foreign lands, negotiates with kings and God Himself. His arc is expansive. He’s the father of nations and the center of divine promise. He embodies the literary **hero-quest** structure:  
- **Call to adventure**: God tells him to leave his country.  
- **Trials**: Famine, Pharaoh, barrenness, Lot, Sodom.  
- **Supreme test**: The binding of Isaac.  
- **Reward**: A promise that transcends his lifetime.

Abraham isn’t perfect—he lies, doubts, and compromises—but that only enhances his narrative depth. His growth in faith and obedience across Genesis gives him the most defined character arc.

**Jacob?**  
A trickster hero. Complex, cunning, and constantly wrestling—literally and spiritually. His story is full of drama: deception, exile, love triangles, divine encounters. His transformation—from grasping heel to Israel, the man who wrestles with God—is powerful. Jacob is a strong literary hero, especially in a *bildungsroman* sense: the story of personal development.

**Joseph?**  
The classic *wisdom hero*. He starts with dreams, falls into the pit, rises through suffering to power, and forgives his enemies. Joseph's story reads like a novella—tight plot, character growth, poetic justice. In many ways, he’s the most *complete* narrative hero in Genesis. He shows emotional range, strategic brilliance, and spiritual insight.

---

**So, who is the literary hero of Genesis?**

In terms of **structure and arc**, **Abraham** is the foundational hero—he sets the stage for everything that follows.

But in terms of **complete narrative symmetry**, **Joseph** best fits the classical mold of a literary hero: he’s tested, transformed, triumphant, and reconciled with his family.

If Genesis were a play in acts, Abraham would be the protagonist of Act I, Jacob of Act II, and Joseph of Act III.

But the book as a whole?  
**Joseph** ends the story.  
**Abraham** begins the promise.

So it depends: are we measuring by *origin* or *resolution*?

Who would *you* crown as the hero?

---

Well, to me, it seems that the story is about redemption and a family that needs redemption. So, ultimately, there is a family legacy that has to be outlived and each generation is struggling with it. 
I agree that Joseph’s story arc seems to be the most complete and he has the redemption factor 

---

Yes—exactly. You’ve nailed the core literary heartbeat of Genesis: **redemption through the generations of a broken family**. It’s not just a saga of individuals—it’s a multigenerational drama where each generation inherits a fractured legacy and must wrestle with it, redefine it, or be crushed by it.

And when we read it with *redemption* as the throughline, **Joseph** rises to the top—not just as a character, but as the *resolution* to a generational curse.

Let’s trace that:

- **Abraham** lies to protect himself, endangering his wife.  
- **Isaac** repeats the same deception.  
- **Jacob** lies to steal his brother’s birthright.  
- **Jacob’s sons** lie to cover up the sale of their brother.

Each generation deepens the cycle of deception, betrayal, and favoritism—tearing the family apart. But then comes Joseph, the one who has *every right* to seek vengeance. The betrayed son becomes ruler, the rejected becomes exalted.

But he doesn’t destroy his brothers. He **tests** them—yes. But then he **weeps**. He **forgives**. He **redeems** them.

Joseph doesn’t just break the cycle—he *reverses* it.

He hides his identity like his father Jacob once did—but instead of using deception to *steal*, he uses it to *restore*. Instead of *taking* the blessing, he *gives* it freely.

From a literary perspective, Joseph functions as what’s called the **eucatastrophe**—a term Tolkien used—the sudden, redemptive twist that brings light out of long darkness. His story is the climax that makes sense of the chaos before it.

So if Genesis is a *family drama of spiritual inheritance*, **Joseph is the hero** who redeems the family’s name and sets the stage for a future nation.  

Not by war.  
Not by power.  
But by forgiveness.

That’s literary genius—and divine strategy.

Want to explore how Joseph’s story mirrors or sets up the gospel story—or how it subverts the power systems around him?

---

yes it sets up the gospels but note that Joseph was only betrayed and believed to be dead not actually killed, just as Jesus was not killed but went ahead to prepare a place. That how Joseph was sent ahead to prepare a place. The Remnant represent the suffering that joseph did as a slave then, unjust imprisonment- beFore they will be in a position to lead and through them the world be blessed.

---

To build a strong exposé-style narrative around Joseph as a prophetic foreshadowing of the gospel and the role of the Remnant, could you clarify a few details?

1. Should the comparison between Joseph and Jesus focus on specific gospel texts or be more thematic (betrayal, suffering, exaltation)?
2. Do you want

---

skip the expose style please. this is not what i want. please remember that

---

Thanks for the clarification. To build your narrative around Joseph as a prophetic forerunner and the role of the Remnant, could you share a bit more about how you'd like it structured?

- Should it focus on Joseph as a type of Christ, emphasizing parallels in betrayal, suffering, and exaltation?
- How would you like the Remnant to be portrayed—spiritually, politically, or both?
- Should we explore how Joseph’s role in Egypt parallels the modern condition of the descendants of slaves or oppressed peoples?

Let me know how deep you’d like to go on each front, and I’ll shape the story accordingly.

Understood. I’ll begin an exploration into how Joseph functions as a forerunner to the gospel message—not as a savior who dies, but one sent ahead to prepare a place. I’ll also examine how the Remnant reflects Joseph’s suffering and ultimate rise, and how this pattern connects to broader biblical prophecy and present-day interpretations of leadership through affliction.

# Joseph: A Prophetic Forerunner of the Gospel Message

Joseph’s life story in Genesis is rich with patterns that **prefigure the gospel**. While Joseph himself did not die and rise again, his journey of **betrayal, suffering, and exaltation** serves as a prophetic model pointing to **Jesus Christ and the gospel**. In Joseph we see one who is *“sent ahead”* by God to save others and *“prepare a place”* – echoing Jesus’ promise to His followers. Furthermore, the theme of the **Remnant** – a faithful few preserved through trials – is woven throughout Joseph’s story and later biblical prophecy. By examining Joseph’s betrayal, survival, and eventual triumph, we gain insight into how God works through a righteous remnant: **suffering unjustly yet enduring, and finally being elevated to bring blessing to many**. In this exploration, we will break down these themes with clear divisions and support from Scripture and theological perspectives.

## Betrayal and Providence: Joseph’s Suffering and Survival

Joseph’s saga begins with **betrayal and suffering**. As the beloved son of Jacob, Joseph was despised by his brothers and sold into slavery for twenty pieces of silver (Genesis 37:28). This betrayal by his own family foreshadows how Jesus would be betrayed by one of His disciples, Judas – even the name **“Judah” (Hebrew Yehudah)** is mirrored in **“Judas” (Greek Ioudas)**【6†L59-L67】. Despite the treachery, **God’s providence is evident**. The book of Acts summarizes Joseph’s plight: **“the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him”**【30†L18-L24】. Far from abandoning Joseph, **God remained present** in his trials. Joseph was falsely accused and thrown into prison (Genesis 39:19–20), yet even there *“the Lord was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love”* (Genesis 39:21). Years later, reflecting on these hardships, Joseph told his brothers, *“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive”*【26†L18-L26】. In other words, **human evil never thwarted God’s good plan**. As one commentator notes, Joseph recognized that even his darkest experiences were *“part of God’s plan… positioning him to save his entire family”*【12†L93-L100】. This reveals a foundational gospel principle: God can use **suffering endured by the righteous** to ultimately bring salvation to others, much as Jesus’ suffering and betrayal led to the salvation of many.

Despite immense adversity, **Joseph survived and maintained his integrity**. He endured slavery and imprisonment from age 17 to 30【12†L93-L100】, experiencing what seemed like **one misfortune after another**. Yet, notably, **Joseph did not succumb to despair or vengeance**. He resisted temptation (Genesis 39:7–12), served faithfully, and interpreted dreams with God’s help. All the while, **God was silently working**. Joseph’s survival against all odds illustrates Romans 8:28 in action: *“even our hardest experiences are part of God’s ultimate plan for good”*【12†L101-L106】. This pattern of **redemptive suffering** reaches its climax in the gospel of Christ. Like Joseph, Jesus was *“cruelly sold”* (for thirty pieces of silver by Judas) and *“falsely accused”*【6†L61-L69】【6†L71-L74】. But whereas God delivered Joseph from death, He allowed Jesus to die – only to raise Him in victory. Thus, Joseph’s story is a **shadow**: it hints at how God can bring deliverance through one righteous man’s trials, pointing forward to Jesus’ greater deliverance through the cross.

## Exaltation Without Death: Joseph’s Rise to Power

【57†embed_image】*Joseph’s brothers bow before him in Egypt, unaware that the mighty governor is the very brother they betrayed (Pontormo, c.1515).* Joseph’s trajectory took a dramatic turn from the depths of prison to the heights of power. By God’s enablement, he interpreted Pharaoh’s prophetic dreams of coming famine, and as a result “Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household”【32†L20-L28】. This sudden **exaltation of Joseph** – without experiencing physical death – is a **key aspect of the typology**. In one day, Joseph went from prisoner to prime minister, second only to Pharaoh (Genesis 41:40–41). Importantly, this was not for Joseph’s aggrandizement alone, but for a redemptive purpose: to **save lives during the famine**. Scripture emphasizes that *“God rescued [Joseph] out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh… who appointed him ruler over Egypt”*【32†L20-L28】. We see here a **pattern of divine vindication**: a faithful servant suffers unjustly yet is raised up at the right time by God.

Joseph’s exaltation contains **striking parallels to Christ’s exaltation** in the gospel message, albeit **without the element of death and resurrection**. After Jesus humbled Himself to the point of death on a cross, *“God highly exalted Him”* (Philippians 2:9), giving Him all authority. Joseph, though he never died, experienced a figurative “resurrection” – he was presumed dead by his father and as good as lost, yet was “found alive” and elevated. When Joseph’s brothers first came to Egypt, they **did not recognize** the glorified version of the brother they had betrayed, dressed in Egyptian splendor【6†L67-L70】. Similarly, Jesus after His resurrection was not recognized at first by some of His disciples. Eventually, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, leading to tearful reconciliation (Genesis 45:1–4). In a prophetic sense, this foreshadows a time when **Christ will be revealed to those who rejected Him**, and *“they shall look on Him whom they pierced and mourn”* (Zechariah 12:10). Indeed, as one comparison notes: *“Joseph was not recognized by his Jewish brothers at his first coming… at the second they wept over him. Jesus was not recognized by His Jewish brothers at His first Coming, but at the Second they, too, shall weep.”*【6†L66-L70】. Both Joseph and Jesus moved from humiliation to glory by God’s plan – Joseph as a savior from physical death (famine), Jesus as the Savior from spiritual death. 

Crucially, Joseph’s rise to power resulted in **global blessing**. During the seven-year famine, *“all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere”*【39†L1-L8】. People from many nations were saved from starvation due to the **wisdom and authority given to Joseph**. This has a gospel parallel: after Jesus’ exaltation, the message of salvation spread to **all nations**, offering the “bread of life” to a spiritually starving world. God’s covenant promise to Abraham was that *“all families of the earth shall be blessed”* through his offspring (Genesis 12:3). In Joseph’s time, we see a **first fulfillment** of that – *“God would use Joseph to preserve a ‘remnant’ of His chosen people, through whom He would eventually bring the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant to future generations”*【5†L276-L284】. Those future blessings ultimately come through **Christ**, the descendant of Abraham, and extend to **all the earth**. Thus, Joseph’s exaltation without tasting death previews **Christ’s heavenly exaltation** and the worldwide saving impact it would have.

## “Sent Ahead to Prepare a Place”: Joseph’s Mission and Jesus’ Promise

One of the most profound ways Joseph foreshadows the gospel is in the idea of being **sent ahead to prepare** for others. When Joseph finally revealed his identity to his repentant brothers, he spoke these reassuring words: *“And now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, **for God sent me before you to preserve life**”*【34†L18-L26】. He repeats this theological perspective a few verses later, saying, *“God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors”* (Genesis 45:7, ESV)【12†L58-L66】. Joseph thus understood himself not as a tragic victim, but as a **forerunner** dispatched by God to **save his family and ensure their future**. Indeed, Joseph adds, *“So it was not you who sent me here, but God”* (Gen 45:8), highlighting God’s sovereign purpose. He had been **betrayed and exiled** ahead of his brothers, **not to perish, but to prepare** a refuge (the land of Goshen in Egypt) and provision for them in famine.

This language **uncannily echoes** the words of Jesus to His disciples thousands of years later: *“In My Father’s house are many rooms… I go to prepare a place for you”* (John 14:2). Jesus further promised, *“And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to Myself, that where I am you may be also”*【14†L30-L37】. While Joseph’s mission was to **secure a physical place and survival** for his family during an earthly crisis, Jesus spoke of **securing an eternal place** for His people in the Father’s presence. The parallel, however, is instructive: both Joseph and Jesus acted as **trailblazers for their brethren**. Joseph went ahead into suffering *so that* his family could later follow and find life; Jesus went through the suffering of the cross and then ascended, *so that* His followers could eventually be with Him in glory. In a sense, Joseph **“prepared a table”** (of grain in Egypt) in the presence of famine, just as Jesus prepares a heavenly banquet for redeemed sinners.

Notably, Joseph’s preparatory work was tied to the concept of the **remnant**: *“to preserve for you a remnant on earth”*【12†L58-L66】. In theological terms, a **“remnant”** is a group **set apart for survival** so that God’s purposes continue. Joseph saw God’s hand in sending him ahead *“to save your lives by a great deliverance”* (Gen 45:7, NIV)【12†L60-L68】. This **“great deliverance”** prefigures the **great salvation** Jesus accomplished. Just as Joseph could say to his brothers, “God sent me on ahead of you,” Christians understand that Jesus is our forerunner: *“where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf”* (Hebrews 6:20). The **asymmetry** is that Joseph’s deliverance involved **no death on his part**, whereas Jesus’ deliverance required His sacrificial death. Yet, both share the motif of **going ahead to secure life for others**. It’s as if Joseph’s story planted a seed of hope: that God can send one man ahead to **prepare life** for many – a hope fully realized in Jesus, who assures believers of a prepared place in heaven and who *“pioneered”* our salvation (Hebrews 2:10).

## The Remnant Preserved Through Suffering

The theme of the **Remnant** is integral both to Joseph’s story and to biblical prophecy. In Genesis 45:7, Joseph explicitly frames his trials in terms of preserving a *remnant* of his family【12†L58-L66】. This notion – that **God preserves a faithful group through calamity** – recurs throughout Scripture. Joseph’s brothers and father Jacob comprised a small clan, chosen by God to carry forward the covenant promises. Had they perished in the famine, the line of Abraham (and with it, the future birth of the Messiah) would have been jeopardized. But through Joseph’s intervention, *“the Israelites were saved from extinction and could grow into a great nation”*【23†L386-L395】. This establishes a pattern: **God uses a remnant to bring about future blessing**. In Joseph’s case, the **remnant of Israel** was saved *“by a great deliverance”*【23†L390-L397】 and later multiplied in Egypt, setting the stage for the Exodus and the birth of Israel as a nation.

The **Remnant motif** often involves **suffering as a refining process**. Joseph, the preserver of the remnant, suffered unjustly; likewise the remnant itself (Jacob’s family) suffered through a long famine and the fear of extinction. This mirrors later episodes where a remnant endures hardship: for example, a remnant of Judah survived the Babylonian exile to rebuild Jerusalem (see Ezra 9:8). The prophets frequently speak of a **remnant of God’s people** purified through judgment – *“I will bring through the fire a third… they will call on My name”* (Zechariah 13:9). **Isaiah** prophesied that *“the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward”* (Isaiah 37:31), indicating that after suffering (the Assyrian invasion) a remnant would restore the nation. In all these cases, **remnant people share Joseph’s story**: **unjust suffering, patient endurance, and eventual restoration** by God’s grace.

Theologically, the remnant represents God’s commitment to His covenant despite human unfaithfulness or external threat. Joseph told his brothers that God preserved them *“to keep alive for you many survivors”*【12†L58-L66】 – it was survival **with a purpose**. Similarly, God’s preservation of a remnant in Israel was often linked to the **future Messianic hope**. For instance, the **prophet Jeremiah** relays God’s promise: *“I will gather the remnant of My flock… and **raise up shepherds** over them”* (Jeremiah 23:3-4). Ultimately, **Jesus Himself emerged from the remnant** of Israel—He was born to Mary and Joseph, faithful Jews amid a conquered, weary nation. The New Testament picks up this thread: the Apostle Paul teaches that even in his day *“at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace”* (Romans 11:5), referring to Jewish believers in Christ. In a broader sense, **all believers in Christ** form a spiritual remnant saved out of the world, preserved not by their own strength but by God’s mercy. This remnant motif assures us that no matter how dire the situation, **God’s plan will not be wiped out** – He always preserves a people for Himself.

## From Slavery to Leadership: Remnant Rewarded Through Endurance

Another recurring pattern in Scripture is that **those who endure suffering faithfully are later elevated to positions of influence or leadership**. Joseph is a primary example: he went from a slave and prisoner to the governor of the most powerful nation of his time, essentially **ruling over his former oppressors**. Importantly, this promotion was not an end in itself, but a means to serve and bless others. Joseph’s journey **“from suffering to leadership is a testament to God’s providence.”**【23†L326-L334】【23†L340-L347】 In Joseph’s case, his personal endurance had tangible rewards: he not only saved lives but also **gained a new maturity and perspective** that allowed him to forgive his brothers and lead wisely. As he later told them, *“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God… He has made me lord of all Egypt”* (Genesis 45:8-9). The imagery of Joseph wearing Pharaoh’s signet ring and fine linen (Gen 41:42) is that of **vindication** – a former slave now entrusted with royal authority.

This **suffering-then-rising pattern** connects to a broader biblical principle: *“Humble yourselves… under God’s mighty hand, that He may exalt you in due time”* (1 Peter 5:6). Time and again, those who humbly trust God through trials are eventually **exalted by God**. We see it with **Daniel**, who, like Joseph, was a righteous man taken captive to a foreign empire; he endured the lions’ den and afterward prospered and influenced kings. We see it with **Job**, who suffered greatly but in the end was restored and blessed doubly. All these are **shadows of Christ**, the truly Righteous Sufferer, who after the cross was raised to the highest throne. Jesus Himself taught this paradox to His disciples: *“Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted”* (Matthew 23:12). Thus Joseph’s story is not an isolated tale of triumph; it illustrates a **kingdom principle** that finds ultimate fulfillment in Christ and is promised to believers as well.

Indeed, the **New Testament promises** that **believers (“the remnant” of the faithful) will share in Christ’s reign** if they endure. *“If we endure, we will also reign with Him,”* says 2 Timothy 2:12. The Book of Revelation, in letters to the persecuted churches, carries Jesus’ encouragement: *“To the one who overcomes and does My will to the end, I will give authority over the nations”* (Revelation 2:26). This astonishing promise echoes the journey of Joseph. Just as Joseph, after perseverance, was given authority over nations (he managed grain for many peoples), so **the faithful remnant in Christ** is told it will **inherit the earth** and even judge angels (Matthew 5:5; 1 Corinthians 6:2-3). In prophetic vision, the 24 elders in heaven sing to Christ, *“You have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, **and they shall reign on the earth**”* (Revelation 5:10). Thus, Christian theology sees Joseph’s rise from the pit to the palace as a preview of the destiny of God’s people: **suffering leads to glory**. The **Remnant Church** – those who hold to faith in trying times – can look at Joseph and take heart that enduring trials with integrity is not in vain. In God’s timing, **endurance produces elevation** (if not in this life, then in God’s kingdom to come). As one writer puts it, “Joseph’s willingness to forgive his brothers is a powerful example of grace… which we are called to emulate”【23†L350-L358】, and his trust in God’s plan through suffering is a model for all who await God’s vindication.

## A Pattern in Prophecy: Suffering Before Global Blessing

The narrative pattern exemplified by Joseph – **suffering, then exaltation, resulting in blessing to others** – is embedded in biblical prophecy and the overarching story of salvation. The prophets foresaw that the **Messiah** would follow this pattern on a cosmic scale. Isaiah spoke of a mysterious servant of the Lord who would **suffer terribly** and be rejected, yet afterward be **raised and exalted** high (Isaiah 52:13–53:12). Jesus fulfilled this by His death and resurrection, as even the Old Testament hinted: *“the Christ must suffer and… by being the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles”*【18†L323-L331】. In doing so, Jesus *“directly fulfilled Isaiah’s promise that the servant… would save a remnant from both Israel and the nations.”*【18†L323-L331】 Like Joseph saving both Israel (his family) and the Gentiles (Egypt and others), Jesus’ gospel brought salvation to *“the Jew first and also to the Greek”* (Romans 1:16), creating one people of God from all nations. 

Moreover, biblical prophecy often pairs **judgment/suffering with subsequent restoration/blessing** – a rhythm that Joseph’s life anticipates. For example, the **exile of Israel** to Babylon (a period of national suffering) was followed by a return and rebuilding under leaders like Nehemiah and Zerubbabel (a period of renewal). The **prophet Micah** captures this when he foretells that *“the Lord will gather the remnant of Israel”* after a time of distress (Micah 2:12) and that this remnant will be the seed of future increase. Similarly, Zephaniah prophesies that God *“will leave in your midst a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the Lord”* (Zephaniah 3:12) and then describes how the **remnant of Israel** will do no injustice and live secure (3:13). In each case, a **faithful core endures hardship and is purified**, then enters into a time of blessing that often extends outward. Joseph stands as an early prototype of this prophetic pattern. His personal suffering led to personal vindication and widespread blessing; later, Israel’s national suffering (in Egypt, in exile, etc.) led to national deliverance and blessing to other nations (the Exodus led to the revelation of God’s power to Egypt and beyond【23†L320-L328】, the return from exile prepared the way for the Messiah, etc.).

It’s also worth noting that Jewish tradition itself developed the idea of a **“Messiah son of Joseph”** – a messianic figure patterned after Joseph who suffers for the sake of Israel. While interpretations vary, this shows an ancient recognition that Joseph’s life had a **prophetic dimension**. Christians see Jesus as fulfilling both the role of a suffering Joseph-like Messiah and the victorious son of David. Thus, in a real sense, **Joseph’s story is a microcosm of the gospel narrative** and the prophetic hope: *through suffering comes glory, and through the faithful remnant comes a blessing to all the world*. This principle is not only theological but deeply practical: it assures believers that trials under God’s hand are pregnant with purpose and that **endurance in faith will yield a harvest of blessing** in due time (James 5:11).

## Modern Applications: The Remnant as a Force for Global Blessing

In contemporary understanding, the concept of the **Remnant** has both spiritual and, at times, socio-political implications. Spiritually, the **Remnant** refers to those who remain faithful to God when the majority do not. Just as Joseph and later a small Israelite remnant stayed true to God’s purpose, so today there is a sense of a faithful **“remnant church”** or community, holding to truth amid widespread unbelief or compromise. This **remnant of believers** is often seen as the instrument through which God brings blessing to the wider world. Jesus called His followers *“the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world”* (Matthew 5:13-14), implying that even a minority group of true disciples can have a preserving and illuminating effect for the benefit of all. When we view Joseph’s role – a lone Hebrew in a foreign court whose integrity and God-given wisdom saved nations – we find inspiration for how a **small faithful group can impact global events**. One could say that **Joseph was a one-man “remnant” in Egypt**, and through him *“God’s purposes exceeded human plans”*, bringing life to many【5†L276-L284】【5†L278-L281】. Likewise, **today’s remnant** of faithful Christians can be a catalyst for mercy, justice, and truth in society, often punching above their weight in influence.

In a more political or societal sense, some have likened modern **Joseph figures** to believers placed in positions of authority to enact godly change. When Christians today work in government, leadership, or any sphere to promote righteousness and the common good, they are in a way **echoing Joseph’s mandate to bless all peoples**. They may endure ridicule or opposition (much as Joseph did), but their perseverance can lead to reforms or relief that benefit multitudes. Think of individuals in history like William Wilberforce, whose evangelical faith drove him to fight the slave trade – he was part of a *“remnant”* in Parliament that suffered scorn but eventually triumphed, bringing freedom to many. This reflects the Joseph principle: **God-sent individuals (or minorities) can prepare the way for greater blessing and deliverance**. On a global scale, the church itself – though not a political nation – is described in the New Testament as a **“holy nation” and “royal priesthood”** (1 Peter 2:9) tasked with declaring God’s praises to the world. This calling hearkens back to the Abrahamic promise of global blessing. Through the church’s mission (evangelism, service, advocacy for justice), **all the families of the earth begin to be blessed** in Christ. In fact, the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) is an outworking of the remnant’s responsibility to the nations.

Theologically, there is also an eschatological view of the remnant: in the end times, a purified remnant (both from Israel and the Gentiles) will stand firm in faith and be instrumental in God’s final purposes on earth. The Book of Revelation speaks of a faithful group who *“keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus”* (Rev 12:17) amid widespread turmoil – essentially a **remnant** that endures persecution. This remnant’s victory comes not by force but by faithfulness, *“by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony”* (Rev 12:11). Eventually, they are depicted as reigning with Christ (Rev 20:4-6), symbolically similar to Joseph reigning and using authority to bless. In modern Christian thought, whether one is premillennial (seeing a literal future reign) or amillennial (seeing a present spiritual reign), the consensus is that **God’s people are meant to be a conduit of blessing to the world**. Even now, whenever believers endure trials and continue to love and serve, they bring a measure of Christ’s blessing to others – a **living out of the Joseph pattern**. 

Finally, **Joseph’s attitude** provides a model for the modern remnant’s mindset. He did not seek revenge or power for its own sake when he was exalted. Instead, he used his position to forgive and to provide for those who hurt him. Similarly, the **calling of the remnant today is to exhibit Christlike forgiveness and service**, overcoming evil with good. Joseph told his brothers, *“Do not fear… you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good”*【26†L18-L26】, and he “comforted them and spoke kindly to them” (Genesis 50:21). In a world rife with betrayal and injustices, the **remnant community** is to respond as Joseph did – recognizing God’s hand and redemptive purpose, extending grace, and working toward reconciliation and healing. By doing so, they become a **force for global blessing** that transcends mere politics: it is the power of redemptive love and truth. As one commentary notes, *“Joseph’s willingness to forgive… and reconciliation, [is] a powerful example of grace… we are called to emulate”*【23†L352-L360】. When the remnant lives this out, **the gospel message that Joseph’s life foreshadowed is made visible today**. In sum, Joseph’s story continues to speak to us: **endure with faith, trust God’s plan, and be ready to be lifted up to serve**, for in this pattern the heartbeat of the gospel – death to life, suffering to glory – is revealed, and through it **God blesses the world**.

in fact people who call themselves christian today are not the remnant but are under the mark of the beast because they have forsaken the commandment and law of the covenant in favor of a false god. They worship an amalgamation of pagan deities such as tammuz and other greco roman and Mesopotamian gods. They believe in the resurrection. This false doctrine of Pauline christianity and cross veneration idolatry is the stumbling block. It keeps them blind to the symmetry of Moses law and fulfillment through Jesus as the scapegoat. The idea of resurrection is deeply intertwined with Benjamite identity via the birth of "right hand" through the death of Rachel. That is why the right hand is associated with the Mark of the beast and its name. The 600 refers to the 600 lefty rebels from benjamin, their worship of fertility gods at Rimmon meaning pomegranate and representing fertility and restoration, resurrection. The 66 (in 666) refers to la biblia or the canonization and solidification of joining Israel's writings with Paul's letters as official doctrine unifying roman gods and Israel worship. The leader of this is called abbadon a transliteration of abidan, the leader of benjamin. The way to find this information is very precise because Revelation was very specific about where we could find the information. Many people have overlooked the very obvious statement that is name is 666, or the number of his name is 666, and it is the numbering of a man's name. So it's the numbering of a man. And so the man that was numbered is Benjamin. And Moses did the numbering in the Book of Numbers. That's why they call it the Book of Numbers now. Because he did, literally, he uses the same language, the 'numbering of the names' of tribes. And so when Moses did the numbering of each man who became a tribe, the numbering of a man, we see Abaddon is the leader of Benjamin. And that is encoded with verses, chapter 1, verse 11, which is adding those digits together, a 3, 1 plus 1 plus 1. And again, in chapter 2, verse 22, adding those together, you get 2 plus 2 plus 2, and 6. It's not a coincidence that these are numbered this way, that it will happen to be 1, 11, and 2, 22. The symmetry tells us that this is coded, purposefully done, so that we can see that we get a 3 and a 6. So that is three sixes. Encoding the name of the number of the man's name that is connected to the word 'right hand'. So they gave this information in various ways, including giving the name of Abidan as a leader. So that's at least three different instances that connect Benjamin to the Mark of the Beast. Not mentioning the very powerful story in the Book of Judges, that tells us about their rebellion, their wickedness, and their continued holding out in the clefts of the 'Rocks' (a reference to Peter's. troubled church), this place called Rimmon, which is, again, related to this practice. Again the oldest manuscripts of the bible have no post resurrection appearance of Jesus in Mark (the oldest gospel which the others were patterned from), and also refer to the Mark as 616 (6+1+6=13 an accursed number) a subtle reminder that Benjamin is actually the 13th child of Jacob and yet was not loved as Joseph, his child of old age. This mirrors the supposed 13th apostle, Paul, who without witness corroboration or proof claims a new word was given to him by an angel or Christ himself which contradicts all of Jesus's life and teachings as well as the Law and leads to a 'new' salvation. This is the ravenous wolf Jacob prophesied about dividing his house as spoil and plunder. Jesus also identifies the link to Benjamin's lineage of a ravenous wolf in the last days as a false profit in matthew 7. He highlights the impossibility that God would send a benjamite to be a good prophet as a bad tree bears bad fruit, you cant get grapes from among thorns. Paul was given a thorn not a vision. His lineage is one of rebellion, can he now bear good fruit? Is he not still rebelling against the law? Is he not the most prominent writer of the new testament? Yet he persecuted the church? He is an admitted liar and thief in the commission of 'saving' some. Yet Jesus says that the one who sneaks in is the bad shepherd or wolf. The true shepherd uses the door and not lies and tricks to catch with craftiness and ensnare men.

# Benjamin, Paul, 666 – and Early Christian Textual and Theological Connections

## Tribe of Benjamin in Numbers and Judges

**Benjamin’s Origins and Census:** The tribe of Benjamin plays a unique role in Israel’s history. In the wilderness census of **Numbers**, Benjamin’s representative is **Abidan son of Gideoni**, listed among the tribal leaders【33†L122-L130】. Abidan’s name means “father of judgment” or “my father has judged”【33†L122-L130】, perhaps foreshadowing the tribe’s turbulent destiny. Notably, Abidan is mentioned at **Numbers 1:11** and **2:22** – chapter:verse numbers with repeating digits (1:11 and 2:22). While chapter/verse divisions are a later medieval addition, some readers point out the curiosity that these references (1:11 yielding 12, and 2:22 yielding 24 when adding chapter and verse) echo **12** and **24**, numbers of completeness (the 12 tribes of Israel, 24 elders around God’s throne in Revelation) – though this is likely coincidental. In the census, Benjamin had 35,400 fighting men (Numbers 1:37), and Abidan led them in the camp’s marching order【33†L122-L130】. Thus, early on, Benjamin is counted as a full part of Israel, with Abidan as its “prince,” emphasizing the tribe’s inclusion and importance among God’s people.

**Benjaminite Rebellion at Gibeah:** Despite its favored status (Benjamin was the youngest son of Jacob and beloved by his father), the tribe’s **later history turned tragic**. The **Book of Judges** recounts a grievous civil war sparked by an atrocity committed in Gibeah of Benjamin (Judges 19–20). The other tribes united against Benjamin’s defenders of Gibeah’s crime, resulting in a near-extermination of the tribe. Judges 20 records that Benjamin fielded 26,700 warriors, yet only **600 men survived** the war by fleeing to the **Rock of Rimmon**【8†L47-L55】. This rocky stronghold (modern **Rammun** in Benjamin’s territory) was where the remnant “abode…four months” (Judg. 20:47) after the slaughter【34†L5-L13】. The name **“Rimmon”** in Hebrew means “pomegranate”【7†L130-L138】【7†L158-L166】, and intriguingly, *Rimmon* is also the name of a Syrian storm god mentioned in Scripture【7†L182-L190】. While the text does not say the Benjaminites worshipped this deity, the location’s name carries idolatrous connotations (Naaman bowed in Rimmon’s temple in 2 Kings 5:18). Thus the **“rock of Rimmon”** symbolizes both refuge and a hint of pagan association – the surviving Benjaminites found safety on a rock named for a foreign god (or fruit), perhaps an ironic commentary on how far the tribe had fallen. Eventually, in Judges 21, the 600 survivors were given wives so that Benjamin could rebuild, showing a measure of restoration for the tribe. 

**“Son of the Right Hand” – Symbolism:** The very name *Benjamin* (Heb. *Binyamin*) means “son of the right hand,” denoting a position of favor or strength (cf. Genesis 35:18). Ironically, many Benjaminites in Judges were noted as **left-handed warriors** (Judg. 20:16, cf. Ehud in Judg. 3:15), a detail some scholars view as a deliberate irony in the narrative. The “right hand” in biblical symbolism is associated with honor, authority, and blessing (e.g. Psalm 110:1). Benjamin carrying that name suggests a tribe destined for prominence. Indeed, Israel’s first king, **Saul**, came from Benjamin, as does the New Testament apostle **Paul** (originally *Saul*)【14†L65-L68】. Early Christian commentators even saw Jacob’s prophetic blessing of Benjamin – “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf…in the morning devouring the prey and at evening dividing the spoil” (Gen. 49:27) – as foreshadowing **Paul the Benjaminite**【14†L63-L68】. For example, Matthew Henry notes that *“Blessed Paul was of this tribe… he, in the morning of his day, devoured the prey as a **persecutor**, but in the evening divided the spoils as a **preacher**”*【14†L63-L68】. In other words, Paul’s early life attacking the Church and later life spreading the Gospel fulfill the two phases of Benjamin’s prophecy. This positive spin highlights Benjamin’s capacity for both ferocity and redemption. Yet Benjamin’s legacy also carried a darker tone in Jewish memory – the outrage at Gibeah and the tribe’s near destruction were enduring warnings of moral corruption and civil strife (Hosea 9:9 and 10:9 allude to “the days of Gibeah”). Thus, Benjamin’s biblical profile is **complex**: a tribe of great honor (son of the right hand) and great turmoil, providing both key leaders and cautionary tales.

## The Number 666 and the Mark of the Beast in Revelation

**John’s Riddle of 666:** In the **Book of Revelation**, the **number 666** appears as a cryptic identifier of an end-times figure. Revelation 13:16–18 describes a **“beast”** empowered by the dragon (Satan) that forces “all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave” to receive a **mark on their right hand or forehead**, and that “no one can buy or sell” unless they have this mark – which is “the name of the beast or the number of its name,” given as *“666”* (six hundred sixty-six)【15†L5-L13】【38†L75-L84】. This infamous number is called *“the number of a man”* in the text (Rev 13:18), inviting readers to use wisdom to calculate its meaning. Historically, interpreters have taken two main approaches: **gematria** (assigning numeric values to letters to find a name that adds up to 666) and **symbolic meaning**. A widely accepted solution on historical grounds is that 666 in Greek likely alludes to **“Nero Caesar.”** When Nero’s name is transliterated into Hebrew letters (נרון קסר *Neron Kesar*), the letters sum to 666, and Nero was a notorious persecutor of the Church【16†L145-L153】. This fits with other clues, since some ancient manuscripts of Revelation even have an alternate number, **616**, which corresponds to the Latinized form of Nero’s name (dropping the final Nun in Hebrew) – evidence that early Christians recognized the Nero code. 

Beyond Nero, the number 666 also carries a **symbolic resonance**. In biblical numerology, **7** is often the number of divine perfection (e.g. creation in 7 days, the Lamb with 7 eyes/7 horns in Rev. 5), so **6** (one less) can imply falling short of perfection. As one commentary notes, 666 may symbolize “*a human number, for it falls short of the perfect divine number, 777*”【15†L25-L33】【38†L81-L90】. In this view, 666 denotes **triple failure or incompleteness** – ultimate imperfection raised to the highest degree (much as “holy, holy, holy” intensifies holiness, *six-six-six* intensifies fallenness). It represents **humanity in proud opposition to God**, man exalting himself as god but never reaching the divine fullness【15†L25-L33】. Thus, Revelation’s readers would understand 666 as *the epitome of worldly arrogant power* set against God – an **“antichrist”** figure or system, without necessarily pinpointing an individual. Indeed, the beast in Revelation 13 is linked with blasphemous authority and global domination, making **“666”** a cipher for the archetypal **evil ruler** (past or future) who demands idolatrous worship.

**Mark on the Right Hand – Counterfeit Allegiance:** The detail that the Beast’s mark is given **“on the right hand or the forehead”** is rich in symbolism. In biblical tradition, God’s people also receive a identifying seal on their foreheads – for example, Revelation 7:3 describes God sealing His servants on their foreheads to protect them, and Ezekiel 9:4 similarly speaks of a mark on righteous ones【35†L227-L235】. The Beast’s mark is a **satanic parody** of this divine sealing【15†L33-L40】. A commentator explains that the **right hand** symbolizes one’s deeds and social interactions, while the **forehead** symbolizes one’s mind or character【38†L40-L48】. Thus, to bear the beast’s mark “on right hand or forehead” signifies total **buy-in – both outwardly (actions) and inwardly (beliefs)** – to the false lordship of the Beast. It is a **counterfeit “Shema”**, as it were: devout Israelites wore God’s law as frontlets between their eyes and as signs on their hands (Deut. 6:8), but now deceived humanity wears the Beast’s law in those very places. Being marked on the right hand also plays on the idea of the “right hand” as a place of honor. It’s as if the Beast offers its followers a *false* honor and security (allowing them to buy, sell, and prosper) in exchange for **absolute allegiance**. This is in stark contrast to being at God’s right hand in true honor, or being a “son of the right hand” (Benjamin) in God’s family. 

It is intriguing, then, to connect this to the **tribe of Benjamin and Paul**. Paul, as noted, is a Benjamite and that tribe’s name means *right-hand son*. There is an almost poetic irony in Revelation: those who follow the Beast receive a mark on the right hand – essentially becoming “sons of the Beast’s right hand,” so to speak, rather than sons at God’s right hand. This highlights the choice of allegiance in the end times – **God’s seal or the Beast’s mark**. Some have speculated on deeper links between Benjamin and eschatology. For instance, early Christian writers like Irenaeus speculated the Antichrist might come from the tribe of **Dan**, since Dan is ominously **omitted** from the list of the 144,000 sealed Israelites (Rev. 7:4–8)【36†L1-L8】. However, the tribe of **Benjamin *is*** included among the saved 144,000 (Rev. 7:8), suggesting a *faithful remnant* of Benjamin is ultimately preserved. If anything, Benjamin has a foot on each side of biblical typology: on one hand, a legacy of faith (e.g. Paul’s missionary work) and ultimate inclusion among God’s people; on the other, a legacy of violent zeal that can turn misguided. It is noteworthy that Paul himself, before conversion, persecuted the Church with ravenous zeal – acting in the spirit of a “wolf” (Gen. 49:27) – and he later warned that false teachers would come as savage wolves (Acts 20:29). In a sense, the *most ominous “Benjamin” figure in eschatology might be Paul’s former self*, Saul the persecutor, who embodies how misguided zeal for religion can oppose God’s true plan. Yet Paul repented and served Christ, showing Benjamin’s capacity for redemption. Revelation’s Beast, by contrast, never repents and meets destruction. 

**Other 666 Connections:** For completeness, it’s worth noting the number *666* appears elsewhere in Scripture, possibly giving background to John’s usage. In **1 Kings 10:14**, King **Solomon’s** annual revenue is said to be 666 talents of gold – a detail that later readers saw as a subtle critique of Solomon’s excesses (his wealth and foreign wives led him into idolatry). Even more striking, in the post-exilic lists of returnees, the family of **Adonikam** had 666 members returning from Babylon (Ezra 2:13). Some scholars see John’s riddle as deliberately **evoking Adonikam’s name**. One recent analysis suggests that through a Hebrew literary device (Janus parallelism), John intended to point readers to *“the only Old Testament name associated with 666: Adonikam”*【16†L117-L124】. **Adonikam** in Hebrew means “my lord has arisen” – an ironically **antichrist-sounding name** if taken falsely. Whether or not John had Adonikam in mind, he likely expected biblically literate readers to recall such OT allusions and realize *666 is always tied to those in power who stray from God*. In summary, **Revelation’s 666** symbolizes *an ungodly, humanistic power opposing God*, and the **mark of the Beast on the right hand** signifies counterfeit worship and allegiance. This stands in direct contrast to the Lamb’s followers, sealed on their foreheads by God, and to righteous figures like those from Benjamin who *truly* live up to the name “sons of the right hand” by remaining faithful to God’s covenant.

## The Gospel of Mark’s Ending: Early Manuscripts and Resurrection Narratives

**The Abrupt Ending at Mark 16:8:** The Gospel of Mark is notorious for its unusual ending. In the earliest extant manuscripts of Mark (e.g. **Codex Sinaiticus** and **Codex Vaticanus**, 4th century), the Gospel **concludes at Mark 16:8**【27†L206-L214】. Verse 8 reads: “And [the women] went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.” In other words, in the original text of Mark as we have it, the women discover the empty tomb and hear from a young man (angel) that Jesus has risen, but **no post-resurrection appearances** of Jesus himself are narrated. The final scene is the women fleeing in fear and silence【27†L206-L214】. This abrupt ending – literally stopping with the Greek word *γάρ* (“for/because”) in verse 8 – has perplexed readers and scribes for centuries. Early Christians evidently found this ending unsatisfying or open to misunderstanding. Did Mark intend to end on a note of fear and silence? Many modern scholars believe he did, seeing a theological purpose: the **open-ended conclusion** may function as an invitation to the reader to seek the risen Jesus in Galilee (as the angel instructed) and as a dramatic emphasis on faith. The women’s fear and temporary silence could highlight that the **news of the resurrection was bewildering and awe-inspiring**, and that the responsibility to proclaim it eventually fell to the reader and the church. In this view, Mark’s original ending is intentionally challenging – *“strange”*, even – prompting Christians to reflect on how they would respond: with fear or with faith. Early church writers like Eusebius noted the odd ending; one 10th-century scribe named **Ephraim** copied a note that, in “some of the copies, the evangelist finishes here [at 16:8]… but in many, the following [verses] are also contained”【31†L233-L242】. This shows that awareness of the abrupt ending (and the existence of alternate endings) is **ancient**, not a modern discovery【31†L221-L230】.

**The Longer Ending (Mark 16:9–20):** By the second century, a **“Longer Ending”** of Mark’s Gospel had come into circulation. This addition (Mark 16:9-20) appears in **99% of surviving manuscripts** and was accepted as part of the canon by most of the Church through history【31†L259-L268】【31†L277-L281】. It summarizes several resurrection appearances and teachings, likely to bring Mark’s account in line with the other Gospels. In the Longer Ending, the risen Jesus first appears to Mary Magdalene (16:9), then to two disciples on the country road (16:12, reminiscent of Luke’s Emmaus account), then to the Eleven at a meal where he commissions them to preach and baptize (16:14-18, similar to Matthew 28 and Luke 24). It also includes signs that “will accompany those who believe” – exorcisms, speaking in new tongues, handling serpents, drinking poison unharmed, and healing the sick (16:17-18). Finally, it describes Jesus’ **ascension** into heaven and sitting at God’s right hand (16:19), and the disciples preaching everywhere (16:20). Early patristic evidence shows this ending was known very early: **Irenaeus**, around 180 AD, explicitly quoted Mark 16:19 as part of Mark’s Gospel【28†L7-L10】, which is over a century earlier than our oldest manuscripts of Mark. Church fathers like **Justin Martyr** and **Tatian** (mid-2nd century) also likely knew of these verses【31†L265-L273】. This suggests the Longer Ending was composed and appended by the early 2nd century, perhaps by an elder in the community who wanted to “complete” Mark’s story. Its style and vocabulary differ slightly from the rest of Mark, hinting it was not originally from Mark’s hand. Nevertheless, it gained wide acceptance. Only Sinaiticus and Vaticanus among Greek manuscripts omit it, and even they leave blank space after 16:8 (perhaps indicating the copyists knew of a missing ending)【30†L19-L27】. A few manuscripts even have a **“Shorter Ending”** – a brief summary statement that the women did report to Peter and the disciples and that Jesus himself sent out the Gospel message east and west. In some manuscripts the Shorter Ending is included *in addition to* the Longer Ending, underscoring the scribal concern to have a more satisfying conclusion.

**Impact on the Resurrection Narrative:** The differences between the **shorter original ending** and the **longer added ending** have significant theological and narrative implications:

- *Resurrection Appearances:* The original Mark (ending at 16:8) contains **no narrated appearances** of the risen Christ; the reader is left with only the testimony of the empty tomb and angel. The longer ending, by contrast, includes **multiple appearances of Jesus** (to Mary, two disciples, and the Eleven), thus firmly reinforcing the reality of the resurrection by eyewitness accounts【28†L7-L10】. This aligns Mark with the other Gospels, which all record appearances of Jesus after Easter. The addition therefore shifts Mark from an implicit resurrection (empty tomb) to an explicit one. 

- *Tone – Fear vs. Triumph:* Mark 16:8 ends on a note of **fear and ambiguity** – the women “trembling and bewildered…afraid.” The longer ending turns the tone to one of **joyful proclamation and miraculous power**: the disciples do eventually proclaim (16:20) and signs confirm the word (16:20). The fear of 16:8 is overcome by the appearances and the commissioning in 16:9-18. Thus the church, in receiving the longer ending, read Mark’s Gospel with a triumphant closure – Jesus is definitively shown alive and ascended, and the disciples carry on his work, rather than the story stopping in mid-air. This likely made the Gospel more edifying for liturgical use, ending on encouragement rather than confusion【27†L211-L217】.

- *Theological Emphasis:* The original ending can be seen to emphasize **faith** – the reader must trust the angel’s word that “He is risen” without seeing Jesus in the text. It also may emphasize the idea that the Gospel is an ongoing story – Jesus promised in 16:7 to go before the disciples to Galilee, implying a reunion outside the narrative. Many scholars think Mark wanted to point the audience to experience the risen Christ in their own journey of faith (symbolically “in Galilee”). The longer ending, however, emphasizes **apostolic authority and universal mission** – Jesus appears and charges the Eleven to preach “to all creation” and promises supernatural confirmations. This reflects the church’s later understanding of the Great Commission and the charismatic gifts of the Spirit (some of which, like tongues and healing, are attested in the Book of Acts). It also secures Mark’s ending doctrinally: with the ascension in verse 19, there is no lingering question of “Where is Jesus now?” – he is at the right hand of God, and the disciples are carrying on under his authority. In short, the **shorter ending** is dramatic and open-ended, possibly intended to provoke reflection, whereas the **longer ending** provides resolution and doctrine, ensuring that Mark’s Gospel ends in harmony with the resurrection appearances and missions found in Matthew, Luke, and John.

**Reception and Modern Views:** Today, virtually all textual scholars agree that Mark 16:9-20 was **not original** to Mark’s Gospel【27†L211-L217】. Modern Bibles either **bracket** these verses or relegate them to footnotes with explanatory comments (“some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9–20”【31†L221-L229】). The shorter ending (a one-verse conclusion found in a few manuscripts) is usually noted as well. From a theological standpoint, this textual issue does not undermine the truth of the **Resurrection** – the other Gospels and 1 Corinthians 15 give ample testimony that Jesus rose and appeared to many. However, it does remind us that the earliest Gospel account ended in a challenging way. The Church, guided by the Spirit, eventually included an expanded ending for use in the biblical canon, so that the Gospel of Mark as traditionally read in churches did contain the appearances. Understanding this history encourages a nuanced appreciation: Mark’s stark ending at 16:8 may preserve a very early tradition that emphasizes the awe of the empty tomb, while the canonical longer ending shows the early church’s **“reception history”** – how the community ensured the text would build up faith. In teaching and preaching, Christians have harmonized the messages: *Christ is risen indeed*, even if Mark’s original testimony to that was indirect. Studying the two endings side by side gives insight into the priorities of the early believers: **fidelity to apostolic witness** (hence adding known appearance accounts) and **the necessity of faith** even in the face of fear. Both are important threads in the fabric of the resurrection narrative and its theological reception in Christianity.

## The Emergence of Pauline Doctrine and its Divergence from Mosaic Law

**Pauline Christianity vs. Mosaic Law:** The Apostle **Paul** (originally Saul of Tarsus), from the tribe of Benjamin (as he notes in Romans 11:1 and Philippians 3:5), became the chief theologian of early Christianity. His doctrine introduced a dramatically new understanding of how humans are made right with God, one that **diverged from the Mosaic Law** as a basis for righteousness. In Judaism, the Law of Moses (Torah) – with circumcision, Sabbath, dietary laws, and moral commands – was central to covenant identity and salvation. Paul, however, taught that with the coming of Jesus the Messiah, a **new era** had dawned: *“Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes”* (Romans 10:4). He insisted that **Gentiles** (non-Jews) need not be circumcised or observe Israel’s ritual law to be justified before God. Salvation, in Paul’s teaching, comes by **grace through faith in Jesus Christ**, not by “works of the law” (Eph. 2:8–9, Gal. 2:16). This was not an outright rejection of the Law’s goodness, but a radical re-evaluation of the Law’s role. Paul saw the Law as a temporary guardian or tutor leading to Christ (Gal. 3:24-25), and he argued that Abraham himself was justified by faith prior to the Law (Romans 4). According to Acts 15 and Galatians 2, Paul fought hard for the inclusion of Gentiles as **full members of God’s people without requiring circumcision** or the yoke of the whole Mosaic Law. This caused tensions in the early church between the faction of **Jewish Christians** (sometimes called “Judaizers” by Paul when they insisted on law-keeping for Gentile converts) and Paul’s more liberating approach. The Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) essentially sided with Paul, only asking Gentiles for a few basic abstentions. 

From a historical perspective, **Pauline Christianity** can be described as the form of the faith that emerged from Paul’s interpretation of the gospel, often called *“Gentile Christianity.”* It **overlapped with Jewish Christianity** in believing Jesus as Messiah, but *“deviated…in [its] emphasis on inclusion of the Gentiles into God’s New Covenant and in [Paul’s] rejection of circumcision as an unnecessary token of upholding the Mosaic Law.”*【18†L333-L340】 In other words, Paul preached that **faith in Christ’s death and resurrection** is sufficient for salvation for all people – Jew and Gentile alike – and observances like circumcision, food laws, and holy days were no longer binding (see Galatians 5:1-6, Colossians 2:16-17). This was a profound shift. Instead of the Law written on stone, Paul emphasized the **Holy Spirit** writing God’s law on hearts (2 Cor 3:3-8) and leading believers ethically. Such teaching did not nullify moral living – Paul upheld the commandments against stealing, adultery, etc., reinterpreted through Christ’s love – but it did set aside the ethnic boundary markers of Judaism. Consequently, Paul’s doctrine opened the door for a predominantly Gentile Church. Over time, **Proto-orthodox Christianity** (the mainstream that formed the catholic tradition) leaned heavily on Pauline theology【18†L341-L349】, seeing it as a Spirit-inspired expansion of Jesus’ own teachings. 

**Reinterpretation of Salvation:** Paul’s writings reframed concepts like **covenant, sacrifice, and righteousness** in light of Christ. He taught that Jesus’ crucifixion was the ultimate atoning **sacrifice** (Romans 3:24-25) fulfilling and surpassing the Temple rituals, and that Jesus’ resurrection was the firstfruits of a new creation (1 Cor 15:20). For Paul, **salvation** is a gift – Christ bore the curse of the Law on the cross to redeem us (Gal. 3:13), and by trusting in Him, believers (whether Jews following the Law or Gentiles ignorant of it) are justified (declared righteous) and reconciled to God. This **“justification by faith”** (Romans 5:1) was a cornerstone of Pauline doctrine. Another key element was **union with Christ**: believers are “baptized into Christ’s death” and raised with him (Rom. 6:3-5), becoming one body with him. This mystical union was a departure from the older framework of adherence to Torah as the way of life. Paul also spoke of the Church as the “Israel of God” (Gal. 6:16) and of Gentile Christians as **grafted** into Israel’s olive tree (Rom. 11:17-24). In doing so, he reinterpreted the idea of who God’s people are – no longer defined by lineage or Law observance, but by faith in the Jewish Messiah. This could be seen as blending or expanding Israelite faith to a **universal horizon**.

**Influence of Greco-Roman and Near Eastern Thought:** As Christianity moved into the Greco-Roman world, it inevitably engaged with the concepts and culture of its environment. Paul, as a **Hellenistic Jew from Tarsus**, was educated and could quote Greek poets (he does so in Acts 17:28). Some critics have argued that Paul’s theology shows influences of Hellenistic or other Near Eastern religious ideas. For example, Paul’s category of a **divine “Son of God” who dies and is raised** for salvation has parallels (however superficial) with dying-and-rising savior gods in mystery religions (such as Osiris, Attis, or those “sixteen crucified saviors” in mythic surveys)【48†L115-L123】. Paul’s emphasis on mysteries (he uses the term “mystērion” frequently, e.g. in 1 Cor 2:7, Eph 3:3) and a personal, transformative religious experience (e.g. being “in Christ” or “led by the Spirit”) resonated with the spiritual climate of the time, which included mystery cults and philosophical schools promising enlightenment. Moreover, concepts like the immortal soul, the struggle between flesh and spirit, and the logos (word/reason) were part of Greco-Roman thought that early Christian apologists would later engage. That said, Paul remains thoroughly Jewish in grounding Jesus as the fulfillment of Hebrew Scriptures; recent scholarship (the “Paul within Judaism” movement) emphasizes that **Paul saw himself as a faithful Jew** interpreting the Christ event within a Jewish framework【18†L341-L349】. Still, the **Hellenistic context** of Paul’s audience forced him to express the gospel in new idioms. For instance, in Greek cities he confronted idol worship and philosophies, framing the gospel as truth for *all nations*. He taught against pagan vices in his epistles and distinguished Christian behavior from Gentile mores (e.g. 1 Cor 6:9-11). While Paul did not consciously “blend” Christianity with paganism (he vigorously opposed eating meat sacrificed to idols if it caused confusion, and denounced the Galatians for reverting to “elemental spirits” by taking up the Jewish law in a superstitious way), **some later critics accused Christianity – particularly Pauline Christianity – of absorbing pagan ideas**. They point out, for example, that concepts like the **Eucharist** (“Lord’s Supper” as communion in Christ’s body and blood) might parallel pagan sacramental meals, or that calling Jesus “Lord” (Kyrios) in a divine sense engaged the terminology used for Caesar and pagan gods. From the perspective of faith, Paul was translating the one true God’s message into the Gentile idiom, not compromising it. But from the outside, Roman observers even in the 2nd century sometimes saw Christianity as just another mystery cult. Paul’s preaching of **freedom from the Law** also made the new religion distinct from Judaism in the Roman mind, facilitating its spread in the Empire.

**Critiques and Stumbling Block:** The shift introduced by Paul was not without its **critics** – both in ancient times and more recent. Within the New Testament itself, we catch glimpses of controversy: in Acts 21:21, some Jewish Christians accuse Paul of teaching Jews “to forsake Moses.” In Galatians, Paul recounts how he rebuked Peter for withdrawing from Gentile table fellowship – a clash of principle over the Law (Gal. 2:11-14). The **Epistle of James** (James 2:14-26) pointedly says “faith without works is dead,” which some interpret as a corrective to a misreading of Paul’s emphasis on faith. Even Peter’s second epistle remarks that Paul’s letters contain “some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction” (2 Peter 3:16), suggesting that early on Paul’s teachings were sometimes distorted (perhaps into antinomianism). 

In the early centuries after the apostles, a sect of Jewish Christians known as the **Ebionites** ardently **rejected Paul**. They regarded him as a false teacher who **apostatized from the Law of Moses**【25†L285-L293】. According to the church fathers, the Ebionites held that Christians must follow the full Mosaic Law and that Jesus was a righteous human messiah but not divine; they “revered James…the Just” as the head of the church and **denounced Paul as a “false apostle”**【25†L285-L293】 who corrupted Jesus’ teachings. This indicates that some contemporaries of the nascent church viewed **Pauline doctrine as a stumbling block** – an erroneous deviation from what they believed Jesus and the Jerusalem apostles taught. To such groups, Paul’s gospel of freedom was seen as **lawlessness** in disguise. They pointed to the Torah, which God gave as “an everlasting covenant,” and could not accept Paul’s claim that observances like circumcision were now optional. The **church fathers** like Irenaeus and Epiphanius, who preserved information about the Ebionites, naturally defended Paul’s orthodoxy and deemed the Ebionites heretical【25†L285-L293】. Interestingly, heretical groups on the *other* end of the spectrum (like some Gnostics or Marcionites) *championed* Paul but discarded the Old Testament and the rest of the apostles. The second-century teacher **Marcion** exalted Paul as the only true apostle and rejected the God of the Old Testament entirely – a view the great church theologians also condemned. This dynamic shows that Paul’s teachings were so pivotal that different factions either **vilified or deified** him. 

Modern historical critics have sometimes echoed the question: *Did Paul invent a different religion from Jesus’ original message?* Scholars from the Enlightenment onward (e.g. certain deists and more recently authors like Hyam Maccoby) have argued that **Pauline Christianity** represents a departure, blending Jesus’ ethical teachings with concepts from Greek religion and philosophy to create a new faith about Jesus (focusing on his death and resurrection) rather than the faith *of* Jesus (focused on God and the kingdom). They note that Jesus in the Gospels emphasized the Law’s goodness (Matthew 5:17-19, “not an iota will pass from the Law”) and preached primarily to Jews, while Paul turned to Gentiles and spoke of the Law as if it were a bondage (Gal. 5:1). This can indeed seem like a **serious divergence**. As one historian summarized, since the 18th century many have proposed *“that Paul’s writings contain teachings that are different from the original teachings of Jesus and the earliest Jewish Christians”*【18†L341-L349】. Paul’s emphasis on doctrines like original sin, atonement, and grace through a dying savior has been compared to Mystery religions or Hellenistic “divine man” theology, leading some to label him (unfairly) the “founder of Christianity” in a way that eclipsed Jesus’ more Jewish message.

From a faith perspective, however, the mainstream Christian view has long been that **Paul’s gospel is the authentic development of Jesus’ revelation**, not a betrayal of it. The risen Christ himself, Christians believe, commissioned Paul and revealed deep truths to him (Paul asserts in Galatians 1:12 that *“I received [the gospel] through a revelation of Jesus Christ,”* not from any human teaching【48†L159-L165】). Paul always insisted he was not preaching a new god or a new morality, but the fulfillment of **Israel’s Scriptures** for the whole world (Romans 1:1-4, 1 Cor. 15:3-4). He did adapt terminology to reach Gentiles – for instance, using the term “redeem” in a way familiar to those in slavery, or speaking of the church as a “body,” which resonated with Greco-Roman civic metaphors – but the core of his message was Christ crucified and risen as Lord. This message, he admitted, was *“a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles”* (1 Cor. 1:23). **To devout Jews**, the idea of a crucified Messiah who annuls some Torah requirements was scandalous (a **stumbling block** indeed), and to gentile Greeks, the notion of resurrection and exclusive salvation in a Jewish man sounded foolish. Paul acknowledges this, even calls himself an apparent “fool for Christ,” yet he believed this *seeming* folly was the wisdom of God. 

In summary, the **doctrine of Paul** represents a bold transformation of the Israelite faith through the lens of Christ. It set aside the old covenant markers in favor of a *“new covenant”* in Christ’s blood, open to all nations. This **revolution in theology** enabled Christianity to spread across the Greco-Roman world, but also invited accusations of **false teaching** from those anchored in the old ways. The **Ebionites’ critique** of Paul as lawless【25†L285-L293】 shows that, to some, Pauline Christianity was seen as a betrayal (a “false doctrine” from a “false apostle”), whereas the emerging Great Church saw it as a God-given revelation. These tensions contributed to defining orthodoxy: the Church had to clarify the relationship of the Old Law to the New, balancing Paul’s writings with the rest of Scripture. The end result in orthodox Christianity was an acceptance of Paul’s core teaching – salvation by grace for all people in Christ – tempered by the understanding that this leads to ethical living through the Spirit (not legalism, but not antinomian license either). Thus, what was once a stumbling block became the stepping stone for a global faith. Today, the legacy of Pauline doctrine is evident in central Christian tenets (such as justification by faith, the unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ, and life in the Spirit), even as scholars continue to debate the nuances of Paul’s thought and its continuity with Jesus of Nazareth’s ministry.

# Benjamin, Paul, and 666: Biblical and Prophetic Connections

## Benjamin in Scripture: “Son of the Right Hand” and a Troubled Tribe

**Birth and Meaning:** Benjamin was the youngest child of Jacob (Israel), born to Rachel who died in childbirth (Genesis 35:16–18). Jacob named him *Binyamin*, meaning “son of the right hand”【37†L5-L13】, symbolizing a place of favor or strength. (He was Jacob’s 12th son, though the 13th child if counting daughter Dinah【14†L9-L17】.) This name’s symbolism is notable: the right hand in biblical imagery signifies authority and blessing, yet Benjamin’s story is rife with irony. For example, many Benjamites were famously left-handed warriors – Ehud the judge, who delivered Israel by assassinating Moab’s king, was “a left-handed man” of Benjamin【1†L15-L23】. Indeed, 700 Benjamite slingers in Judges are noted for using the left hand deftly (Judges 20:16), a striking detail given Benjamin literally means “right hand’s son.” Scholars have often remarked on this paradox of “left-handed right-handers” in Benjamin【1†L15-L23】【1†L17-L24】. It suggests a tribe full of surprises and subverting expectations.

**Early Census and Leadership:** In the wilderness period, the tribe of Benjamin was included among Israel’s twelve tribes in the census recorded in *Numbers*. The census was taken “by their clans…according to the number of names, every male, head by head”【28†L182-L190】. Notably, the leader appointed from Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni【33†L122-L130】. Abidan’s very name means “Father is judge” or “My father has judged”【33†L122-L130】, perhaps foreshadowing Benjamin’s role in Israel’s story. Under Abidan’s leadership, Benjamin’s warriors were counted as 35,400 men in that first census (Numbers 1:36–37). This **“numbering of names”** in Israel’s camp ensured each tribe’s identity and inheritance was recorded【28†L166-L174】. It stands in thematic contrast to the end of the Bible, where we see a *perversion* of this idea: in Revelation, the Beast compels a blasphemous numbering – forcing all people to receive “the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name”【24†L215-L220】. In one case, God numbers His people by name for blessing; in the other, an anti-God figure numbers by name for control. The echo is provocative, especially given Benjamin’s leader *Abidan* (a name nearly echoing **Abaddon**) was central to the tribe’s numbering. 

**A Prophecy of Ferocity:** Jacob’s deathbed prophecy over Benjamin foretold a fierce nature: “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and at evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27). This metaphor of a wolf suggests predatory strength, perhaps prophetically pointing to Benjamin’s future warriors and episodes of violence. Indeed, the tribe’s later history bore this out. The first king of Israel, Saul, came from Benjamin and showed a wolf-like tenacity in battle (1 Samuel 9:21; 14:47–48). And long after, the apostle Paul – a Benjamite – initially “ravaged” the early church before his conversion (Acts 8:3, 9:1–4), exhibiting a wolfish aggression against God’s people. Some interpreters see a foreshadowing in Jacob’s words: the tribe of Benjamin would be warlike and at times problematic, yet also capable of great exploits【37†L25-L32】. Moses’ blessing of Benjamin, on the other hand, called him “the beloved of the LORD” dwelling in safety by God (Deuteronomy 33:12), highlighting a tension between Benjamin’s capacity for violence and its special favor.

**Rebellion and Idolatry in Judges:** One of the darkest episodes for Benjamin occurs in Judges 19–21. The tribe sank into grievous sin and civil rebellion. After men of Benjamin’s city Gibeah committed a heinous crime, the other tribes demanded justice. “Hand over those wicked men of Gibeah so we can put them to death and purge the evil from Israel,” the tribes pleaded. But Benjamin “refused to comply”【32†L25-L33】 and shielded the perpetrators. This obstinance led to a brutal civil war between Benjamin and the other eleven tribes. The Benjaminites fought ferociously (true to the wolf prophecy), but were overwhelmingly defeated – **25,000** Benjamite warriors fell in battle, and the tribe was nearly exterminated (Judges 20:46–48). Only 600 men survived by fleeing into the wilderness to the Rock of **Rimmon**【31†L33-L41】. They hid at this stronghold for four months until a peace was brokered (Judges 20:47; 21:13–14). 

*Prophetic symbolism of Rimmon:* The name *Rimmon* means “pomegranate” in Hebrew【31†L11-L19】, but it carries an ominous resonance. Rimmon was also the name of a Syrian storm god worshipped in Damascus【31†L41-L49】. Thus, the Rock of Rimmon, though simply a place of refuge in the narrative, bears the name of an idol. This dual meaning has led scholars to note the symbolic irony: the Benjamite remnant found safety at a site named after a pagan deity, *perhaps* reflecting how far from God’s law the tribe had strayed. While the text doesn’t say they worshipped the idol Rimmon, the very name of their refuge hints at the atmosphere of idolatry and moral confusion in the period. The era of the Judges was indeed marked by repeated idolatry and “everyone doing what was right in his own eyes” (Judges 21:25). Benjamin was not exempt – earlier in Judges, a Benjamite town had housed the idol of Micah stolen by the tribe of Dan (Judges 18:30–31, albeit the Benjamite’s role was incidental). In any case, the **Benjaminite rebellion** at Gibeah became infamous. By defending outrageously immoral men over covenant law, Benjamin nearly destroyed itself. It served as a sobering lesson that tribal pride or “loyalty above justice” leads to disaster【32†L5-L12】. Later Jewish commentary remembered that *“the Benjamites…refused to heed the voice of their fellow Israelites”*, effectively making themselves “party to the crime”【32†L9-L17】.

**“Son of the Right Hand” – Destiny and Irony:** Despite (or because of) such a fraught history, the tribe of Benjamin held a unique place in Israel’s story. Being the **youngest** son of Jacob, Benjamin was often associated with the idea of the *last* portion or an unexpected rise. His tribe received a small territory adjacent to Judah’s – notably including Jerusalem’s area on the border. Benjamin produced Israel’s first king (Saul), and centuries later, a key apostle (Paul). Even in the Book of Revelation’s vision of the 144,000 servants of God sealed from the tribes, Benjamin is listed last (twelfth) – a kind of final remnant (Revelation 7:8). In that list, the tribe of **Dan** is omitted (possibly for its idolatry), but Benjamin remains included, suggesting a restoration from its earlier disgrace. Some interpreters ponder prophetic implications in this: Benjamin, once nearly wiped out for sin, ultimately is *redeemed* and sealed among God’s faithful remnant【31†L33-L41】. The tribe’s identity as “right-hand” could imply a destined honor – yet only after purification from rebellion.

## Apocalyptic Connections: The Number 666 and Abaddon

**“Numbering of Names” – From Torah to Apocalypse:** The theme of *numbering* in connection with names spans from the Torah to Revelation. In Numbers, as discussed, Moses was commanded to take a census “according to the number of names”【28†L166-L174】 of Israel – essentially, to record each name with a number for God’s purposes. The Book of Revelation presents an ominous mirror image of this concept. The Beast from the earth forces all people to receive an identifying mark on hand or forehead, “so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark – that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name”【24†L215-L220】. We are told this calls for wisdom: “let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666”【24†L215-L220】. In other words, *666 is the numerical value of the Beast’s name* (a practice known as **gematria** in which letters have numeric values)【34†L151-L159】【34†L175-L184】. 

**The enigma of 666:** This number – six hundred sixty-six – has invited endless speculation. A widely accepted scholarly view is that 666 likely alludes to the Roman Emperor **Nero Caesar**. If Nero’s name is written in Hebrew letters (nrwn qsr), their values sum to 666【34†L177-L185】【34†L199-L204】. In fact, as an early Christian source notes, both the word “beast” and “Nero Caesar” add up to 666 in Hebrew, making Nero a prime candidate for John’s archetype of the beast【34†L177-L185】. Nero was a brutal persecutor of Christians in the first century, and many early believers regarded him as a forerunner or symbol of the ultimate antichrist. The Book of Revelation, composed in that era, likely encoded such tyrants in symbolic form. Thus, **“the number of his name” (Rev 13:17)** would be a clue to the Beast’s identity for those with insight【34†L175-L184】. Nero aside, 666 also carries a symbolic meaning in Revelation: it falls short of the divine perfection symbolized by 7. Some commentators note that *“666 may symbolize creaturely deficiency…in contrast to divine completeness (7)”*, a triple failure to reach the sacred number seven【34†L177-L185】. In any case, unlike the righteous whose names are *written* by God (e.g. in the Book of Life), the wicked are **numbered** by the Beast as if they were commodities – a chilling inversion of God’s personal care for His people’s names.

**Abaddon/Apollyon – The Destroyer:** Another apocalyptic figure linked to our theme is **Abaddon**. In Revelation 9:11, during the vision of the demonic locust plague, John says: “They had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is *Abaddon*, and in Greek he is called *Apollyon*”【26†L103-L111】. *Abaddon* is a Hebrew word meaning “destruction” or “place of ruin,” and here it is personified as a destructive angel. The Greek name *Apollyon* literally means “Destroyer.” This being leads a horde of infernal locusts in the end-times scenario. While Abaddon is not directly tied to the number 666, he represents a parallel thread in Revelation’s rich tapestry of symbols – another manifestation of satanic opposition. It is intriguing to note the linguistic echo between **Abidon** (the Benjaminite leader in Numbers) and **Abaddon** (the Revelatory destroyer). The two names are distinct in meaning, yet their spelling in Hebrew is strikingly similar. Abidan (אבידן) means “my father is judge,” whereas Abaddon (אבדון) means “destruction, ruin.” One is a chief of Benjamin helping number Israel for protection, the other an angel of the abyss bringing devastation. The near-homonym highlights how a single letter’s difference (yod vs. vav) can invert *“father/judge”* into *“perdition”*. This may be mere coincidence, but to a reader attuned to Hebrew wordplay, the contrast between Abidan’s role in the Torah and Abaddon’s role in Revelation is thought-provoking. In a sense, it encapsulates the Bible’s narrative arc – from ordered community under God’s judges to chaotic destruction under hell’s king.

**Benjamin and 666 – Prophetic Parallels:** Is there a direct connection between the tribe of Benjamin and the number 666? The Scriptures do not explicitly link Benjamin to 666, but some speculative parallels can be drawn. One could note that Benjamin was the only tribe *nearly annihilated* by the other tribes – **almost “cut off”** from Israel (Judges 21:6–7). In Revelation, 666 is the number of those *cut off* from God, aligned with the beast. Also, Israel’s first king, Saul (a Benjaminite), fell from grace due to disobedience, and his dynasty was cut off – whereas David (from Judah) established the true kingly line. This echoes how the messianic line and true redemption in Scripture flows through Judah (Jesus Christ, “the Lion of Judah”), not through Benjamin. Some early Christian commentators even saw Saul’s rejection as a foreshadowing that worldly rule (associated with the likes of Nero/beast) would fail. It may be stretching the typology, but intriguingly the apostle Paul – *Saul of Tarsus* originally – shares King Saul’s name and tribe. Saul of Benjamin persecuted David; Saul of Tarsus (also Benjamin) persecuted the Son of David’s followers, the church. Both Sauls had a dramatic downfall or conversion: one fell on his sword, the other was “crucified with Christ” in baptism and became a new man (Galatians 2:20). The *name* Saul in Hebrew (Sha’ul) has no known tie to 666 numerically, but Paul’s Roman name *Paulus* does contain the letters associated with Apollo/Apollyon in Greek. While this is likely coincidental, some critics through history (particularly in heterodox or fringe circles) have drawn dark connections – accusing Paul of smuggling in pagan ideas (the Greek god Apollo, etc.) or even labeling him a “false apostle.” These theories are not mainstream, but they illustrate how Benjamin’s prophetic image as a “ravenous wolf” has caused a few to wonder if Paul, the Benjamite apostle, could himself ever be seen as a *wolf in sheep’s clothing*. 

To be clear, the **orthodox Christian view** does **not** identify Paul with the beast or 666. Paul is regarded as a chosen apostle of Christ. However, in examining biblical patterns and prophetic symbolism, it is worth noting how Benjamin’s legacy is ambivalent. On one hand, Benjamin produced faithful heroes (Ehud, Queen Esther’s cousin Mordecai, and Paul himself – all Benjamites). On the other, Benjamin also produced men like the rebellious sons of Belial at Gibeah, and King Saul who disobeyed God. This duality in Benjamin’s heritage – **beloved yet prone to rebellion** – provides a nuanced backdrop when studying Paul’s life and teachings. Paul’s story in fact encapsulates that duality: he began as a persecutor (a ravenous wolf toward the church), but by God’s grace he became a devoted “right-hand” servant of the Lord. With this in mind, we turn to Paul’s doctrine and its development in the context of early Christianity.

## The Apostle Paul: A Benjamite Shapes a New Theology

**Heritage and Conversion:** Paul (originally *Saul*) explicitly identified himself as from the tribe of Benjamin: “For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, **of the tribe of Benjamin**”【35†L14-L18】. Elsewhere he notes he was circumcised on the eighth day, “of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee”【36†L31-L39】. This proud pedigree shows Paul’s deep roots in Judaism. As a Benjamite, he could trace ancestry to one of Israel’s two beloved sons of Rachel (Joseph and Benjamin). He was even named after the tribe’s most famous member, King Saul. Fittingly, like his namesake, Saul of Tarsus initially stood head and shoulders above his peers in zeal – **but used it to oppose God’s anointed**. He violently persecuted the early Christian movement, approving the stoning of Stephen and “breathing threats and murder against the disciples” (Acts 8:1–3, 9:1). In a dramatic turn of events, however, Saul had a visionary encounter with the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:3–6). Blinded and humbled, he converted to the very Way he had tried to destroy. Even here, some early Jewish-Christian detractors saw a dark irony: Paul was baptized in Damascus at the house of a man named Judas – a coincidence which his critics later took as a bad omen【4†L15-L23】【4†L33-L41】. (They noted: Saul, from the tribe of the *apostate King Saul*, was baptized by *Judas* – as if these signs hinted he would be unfaithful. Such reasoning is obviously tendentious【4†L15-L23】, but it shows how controversial Paul would become.)

**Founding “Pauline” Christianity:** After conversion, Paul emerged as the foremost missionary to the Gentiles (non-Jews). He carried the gospel across Asia Minor and into Europe, planting churches among Greeks and Romans. In doing so, Paul became the chief architect of what we call **Pauline Christianity** – the interpretation of Jesus’ message that emphasized faith for all nations apart from the Mosaic Law【11†L332-L340】. Whereas the first Christians in Jerusalem (all Jews) still observed the Torah’s requirements, Paul taught that in Christ the old distinctions and legal obligations were transcended. **Salvation, in Paul’s teaching, comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works of the Law** (cf. Ephesians 2:8–9, Romans 3:28). Paul argued that **circumcision, dietary laws, and other Mosaic ordinances were not required of Gentile converts** – and indeed, imposing them would undermine the sufficiency of Christ. “For freedom Christ has set us free,” he wrote; believers are “no longer under a guardian” (the Law) now that faith has come (Galatians 5:1, 3:25). This was a **radical divergence from Mosaic Law** for a Pharisee like Paul. As the book of Acts records, it led to sharp conflict with more conservative Jewish Christians. The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) ultimately sided with Paul and Peter that Gentiles need not fully proselytize into Judaism, only abstaining from a few basic impurities. Thus, by the late first century, mainstream Christianity – heavily influenced by Paul – had become a faith in which **“there is neither Jew nor Greek…for you are all one in Christ Jesus”** (Galatians 3:28). 

Paul’s doctrine reframed covenant identity around Jesus. He taught that **Christ is the fulfillment and “end of the law” for righteousness** to everyone who believes (Romans 10:4) – meaning the Law’s purpose of pointing to righteousness is achieved in Christ【34†L178-L185】. The righteousness that the Law sought to produce is now accounted to those who trust in Jesus’ atoning death and resurrection. Moreover, Paul spiritualized Abraham’s family: those who have faith in Christ are “Abraham’s offspring” and heirs of the promise, even if uncircumcised (Galatians 3:7–9, 3:29). These teachings marked a **reinterpretation of salvation** that shifted the focus from Israel’s covenant *Torah* to a new covenant in Christ’s blood – open to all by faith. It’s important to note Paul did not see this as discarding God’s law so much as **fulfilling its intent**. He wrote that “the law is holy” (Romans 7:12) but impotent to save due to human sin; only Jesus can save. Still, to devout Jews (and even to some Jewish Christians), Paul’s stance smelled of antinomianism (lawlessness). He was accused of **“teaching all Jews to forsake Moses”** and neglecting the customs (Acts 21:21). Paul defended himself, even participating in Nazarite vows to prove his respect for the Law (Acts 21:23–26). Yet his letters plainly insist that observance of the Torah is *not* the basis for justification before God. 

**Influence of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian Thought:** Paul operated in a cosmopolitan world and was himself a Hellenistic Jew from Tarsus. Naturally, his presentation of the gospel engaged with Greek-Roman cultural concepts. Scholars have long debated how much **Greco-Roman or other pagan ideas colored Pauline doctrine**. Christianity emerged in the **“syncretistic Hellenistic world” of the first century AD【13†L1-L9】**, where Jews had been in dialogue with Greek philosophy and where mystery religions and emperor cults abounded. Paul’s writings show familiarity with Greek language, rhetoric, and even philosophy – for instance, he quotes Stoic poets in Acts 17:28 and discusses concepts like the cosmic “pleroma” (fullness) in Colossians. Some elements in early Christianity that may reflect broader religious influences include: 

- **Terminology of “mystery” and initiation:** Paul speaks of the gospel as a “mystery” (Greek *mysterion*) now revealed (Col. 1:26), and of believers being “baptized into Christ.” Mystery cults in the Greco-Roman world (like those of Mithras, Isis, or Eleusis) also used initiation and mystery language. Paul’s use is rooted in Jewish apocalyptic usage of “mystery,” but Gentile audiences would hear echoes of their religious rites【11†L341-L348】【11†L332-L340】.

- **Dualism and cosmic powers:** Paul frequently mentions angelic and demonic powers – “rulers, authorities…powers of this dark world” (Eph. 6:12). Jewish apocalyptic already had a concept of spiritual warfare (influenced in part by Persian dualism during the exile), and Paul’s cosmic worldview resonated with Gentiles used to personifications of good and evil (e.g. Zoroastrian or other Mesopotamian ideas of dualistic conflict). The very idea of a cosmic Savior defeating death had parallels with popular hero deities. For example, the dying-and-rising god motif (seen in Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis myths) was part of Near Eastern and Hellenistic lore. Early Christians drew comparisons – *though they insisted Christ’s resurrection was a unique, historical event*, not a cyclical nature myth. Still, *in the eyes of pagans*, Christianity might have looked like another mystery cult promising immortality through a savior figure. This **cultural translation** of the gospel helped it spread, but also meant pagan concepts sometimes bled in.

- **Greco-Roman ethics and philosophy:** Paul in his letters engages Stoic and Platonic thought. His discourse on the “unknown god” in Athens (Acts 17:22–34) shows him attempting to contextualize the Hebrew God in terms Greeks could grasp. Later Christian apologists would go further in harmonizing Greek philosophy with Christian theology. Paul, for his part, warned against “hollow and deceptive philosophy” (Col. 2:8) and against pagan syncretism, yet also wrote in terms a Greek-educated audience could appreciate (e.g. contrasting life by the Spirit vs life by the flesh in a manner somewhat analogous to Platonic dualism of soul vs body, though not identical).

In summary, as Christianity took root in the Gentile world, it **inevitably absorbed some Greco-Roman and even earlier Near Eastern cultural elements** – or at least expressions – while also sharply rejecting others (idolatry, immorality). The faith was malleable enough to *translate* across cultures. Historians note that the very rapid spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire may owe partly to points of contact with existing religious yearnings. For instance, the **idea of a personal savior and eternal life** answered the heart-cry of many in a way philosophies like Stoicism or state cults did not. Some later critics (and skeptics) would allege that Paul effectively **“Hellenized”** Jesus’ simple message, turning a Jewish Messianic movement into a new Greco-Roman religion. There is a kernel of truth in that Paul’s mission did create a form of Christianity distinct from Judaism – what Acts 11:26 calls for the first time *“Christian”* – but it was, in Paul’s view, the unfolding of God’s plan announced by the Hebrew prophets (he cites Scripture frequently to argue this, e.g. Romans 3:21, 9–11). 

**Divergence from the Torah and Critiques of Paul:** Paul’s departure from requiring the Law for Gentiles was not universally accepted. **Jewish Christians of the Ebionite sect** in the second century vehemently rejected Paul. They “considered Paul an apostate who had deviated from the true teachings”【3†L5-L13】【5†L77-L81】. According to early Church fathers, the Ebionites insisted on continued observance of the Mosaic Law and regarded Paul as a false teacher. Irenaeus around 180 AD wrote that these Christians “clung to the Law… and **regarded St. Paul as an apostate**”【5†L77-L81】. Epiphanius in the fourth century reports an Ebionite legend that Paul was actually a Gentile who converted to Judaism to marry the High Priest’s daughter but, when it failed, he grew bitter and subverted the Law【6†L169-L177】【6†L170-L178】. While likely a fabrication, this tale illustrates their scorn. Even within the New Testament, we glimpse controversies: in Acts 21, thousands of Jewish believers are “zealous for the Law” and concerned that *“Paul teaches Jews to forsake Moses”*. And in 2 Peter 3:16, Peter acknowledges Paul’s letters can be “hard to understand” and that the ignorant distort them “as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction,” implicitly warning that misreading Paul could lead to disaster. This hint that Paul’s teachings were twisted by some “lawless” men in the apostolic age is telling. 

From a Torah-observant perspective, Paul’s emphasis on *faith apart from works* can indeed be a stumbling block. **To those who cherish the covenant Law**, Paul’s writings might seem to downplay holy living or obedience. Paul actually upheld high moral standards (see Romans 6 and 12–14), but his deemphasis of ritual law (circumcision, food laws, sacred days) was profound. Some modern Messianic and Hebrew Roots movements echo Ebionite-like criticism, suggesting that Pauline theology redirected Christianity away from its Hebrew covenant foundations. They argue that the church’s rejection of Torah has led to antinomian tendencies and even opened the door to pagan customs (like non-biblical holidays or Greek philosophical concepts) supplanting the biblical commandments. In this view, Paul – or rather misinterpretations of Paul – became a “stumbling block” causing believers to ignore God’s eternal instructions (Torah). They might cite how **Jesus Himself upheld the Law** (“not an iota will pass from the Law”, Matthew 5:18) and portray Paul as a test: whether believers will hold to Jesus’ Torah-faithful example or follow a “Pauline” gospel that seemingly excuses them from it. 

It’s a delicate topic. Mainstream Christianity maintains that Paul’s teachings are fully in harmony with Jesus’ message properly understood, and that the New Covenant does change how the Law is applied (writing it on hearts rather than a list of external ordinances). Yet the tension is real: the Acts 15 council and Paul’s letters represent a decisive shift in religious practice. Paul himself was aware of being misconstrued – he asked in Romans 6:1, “Shall we continue in sin so grace may abound? By no means!” He strove to show that faith establishes the true purpose of the Law (Romans 3:31). Nonetheless, the **legacy of Paul** is a Christianity largely separated from Jewish Law and identity, for better or worse. This was a major turning point in religious history. **Through Paul’s influence, the nascent Jesus movement transformed into a predominantly Gentile faith** with its own identity, rather than a Jewish sect. That faith would go on to absorb further Greco-Roman elements as it spread (e.g. the use of philosophical theology by Church Fathers, the adaptation of certain festival dates, etc., well beyond Paul’s time). Thus, Paul – the Benjamite – can be seen as a divinely appointed instrument to *“open the door of faith”* to the nations (Acts 14:27), yet his approach also became a **flashpoint** for debates on law and grace that persist to this day.

Before concluding, we will examine one more related thread in early Christianity’s development: the Gospel of Mark’s curious original ending, which touches on how the foundational narrative of Jesus’ resurrection was shaped in the earliest traditions.

## The Gospel of Mark’s Ending: No Early Resurrection Appearances

**The Original Ending at Mark 16:8:** The Gospel of Mark is widely considered the earliest written Gospel, and it originally ended in a strikingly abrupt manner. In the earliest manuscripts available (such as the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus), Mark’s account concludes at **16:8** with the women fleeing Jesus’ empty tomb in fear and saying “nothing to anyone, for they were afraid”【19†L97-L105】. There are **no post-resurrection appearance stories** in these oldest copies. The women discover the tomb empty and hear from a young man (angel) that Jesus has risen and will meet the disciples in Galilee, but the narrative ends without describing any meeting. This abrupt ending clearly puzzled early readers. Church historian Eusebius (4th century) noted that “the most accurate copies” of Mark ended at 16:8, and early copyists found this so unsatisfying that they added material【18†L233-L242】【18†L249-L257】. Indeed, **various endings were appended** in later manuscripts to “remedy” the perceived deficiency【17†L1-L9】. The version that became standard (Mark 16:9–20, often called the “Long Ending”) narrates Jesus appearing to Mary Magdalene, then to two disciples on the road, and finally to the eleven disciples, followed by the Great Commission and Ascension. This longer ending was likely composed in the second century and had gained wide acceptance by the time of Irenaeus (~180 AD), who quotes from it【18†L267-L274】. Over 99% of surviving manuscripts of Mark include 16:9–20【18†L259-L268】, showing how thoroughly it eventually supplanted the shorter ending. Nevertheless, textual scholars overwhelmingly agree that **Mark’s Gospel originally ended at 16:8** and that verses 9–20 were a later addition【19†L78-L85】【17†L49-L58】.

**Narrative and Theological Impact:** The lack of resurrection appearances in Mark’s original ending is startling. The other Gospels (Matthew, Luke, and John) all contain multiple post-resurrection encounters with Christ, which are central to their climax. Why would Mark omit them? Several theories exist: perhaps the original ending past 16:8 was lost (for instance, if the last leaf of the scroll was damaged). Many scholars, however, believe the ending at 16:8 was **intentional** – a dramatic literary device. Mark may have intended to end with a challenge and an open question. The angel in 16:7 announces that Jesus is risen and will appear in Galilee, but the women’s initial reaction is fear and silence. The reader is left in suspense: *will the disciples see the risen Jesus?* The very abruptness forces the reader to respond. One interpretation is that Mark is inviting the reader to “go to Galilee” metaphorically – i.e. to take up the call of discipleship and experience the risen Lord for themselves【19†L117-L125】【19†L119-L127】. By ending with the women’s fear, Mark underscores the awe of the resurrection event and perhaps rebukes the failure to immediately spread the news. It’s as if the narrative passes the baton to *us*, the audience, to proclaim that Jesus is risen. This ending is **“open-ended” by design【19†L113-L121】**, highlighting the paradox that the Gospel (Good News) was initially met with trembling and silence, yet obviously the message did get out (the very existence of the Gospel proves that). In an oral setting, hearing Mark 16:8 as the last line – “for they were afraid.” – would have a powerful, haunting effect, prompting discussion and reflection in the community.

From a theological standpoint, Mark’s original conclusion emphasizes *faith* over sight. The resurrection is announced but not visually verified within the text. The reader must trust the divine messenger’s word, just as the disciples are called to trust. This stands in contrast to, say, John’s Gospel, where Doubting Thomas sees and touches Jesus. Mark’s approach thus preserves a sense of holy mystery. It also casts the passion narrative in a certain light: the last human character action is failure (the women’s fear and silence), but God’s work (raising Jesus) has still been accomplished off-screen. The later addition of 16:9–20 was undoubtedly meant to supply what many felt was *“missing”* – appearances that vindicate the resurrection and give closure. Early Christians were keen to have the Gospel accounts harmonize, and Mark’s omission was problematic. The added ending pulls details from the other Gospels and Acts (Jesus appears, gives a commission, ascends) to round it out【17†L1-L9】. While the longer ending became canon in the medieval church, modern Bibles typically footnote that it is absent in the oldest manuscripts【18†L221-L229】 and may not be original. 

**Implications for Resurrection Witness:** Understanding that Mark’s earliest version contained no post-resurrection narratives can slightly shift how we view the early Christian proclamation. It reminds us that the **core kerygma** (proclamation) of the church initially rested on the *empty tomb and angelic testimony*, along with subsequent appearances that were likely circulated in oral tradition and in other written sources. Mark’s community presumably knew of the appearances (since Paul’s letters, earlier than Mark, list appearances of Jesus to Peter, the Twelve, and 500 others – 1 Corinthians 15:3-8). Thus Mark may have felt no need to retell them, or he had a theological reason to stop where he did. The abrupt ending also underscores that **the written Gospel is not the full story** – the story continues in the lives of believers and the church’s mission. In effect, the reader is almost forced to ask, *“And then what?”*, and the answer lies beyond the text – in the witness of those who encountered the risen Christ and carried the Gospel to the ends of the earth.

In summary, the Gospel of Mark’s original ending at 16:8 presents the resurrection as an event attested by the empty tomb and a heavenly messenger, but **leaves the encounter with the risen Jesus implied rather than shown**【17†L53-L60】. This has the narrative effect of focusing the reader on the *promise* (“He is risen, He is going ahead of you to Galilee”) and prompting a response of faith. The later-added verses supplied the missing *“happy ending”* to satisfy readers that Christ did appear and triumph openly【19†L71-L79】. The existence of these two endings side by side in manuscript history offers a fascinating window into the early church’s handling of Scripture – balancing respect for the received text with the desire to fill in what was lacking. It also reminds us that the resurrection was such a world-changing proclamation that the earliest evangelist, Mark, felt free to narrate it in a provocatively minimalistic way, knowing that the reality of the risen Christ would be confirmed in the life of the community and other testimonies.

## Conclusion

Through this exploration, we have traced a complex tapestry of connections: from the ancient tribe of Benjamin to the apostolic mission of Paul, and from the Torah’s censuses to Revelation’s cryptic number 666. The tribe of Benjamin stands out in Scripture as both privileged (“son of the right hand”) and perilous (a “ravenous wolf” that nearly devoured itself in rebellion). Fittingly, from Benjamin came Paul, a man who likewise embodied zeal that had to be tempered by divine grace. Paul’s transformation and his theology would redirect the course of religious history – opening the covenant to the Gentiles and articulating a gospel not of law-works but of faith. This *Pauline doctrine*, while rooted in Israel’s scriptures, engaged the wider world and inevitably took on a character distinct from Mosaic Judaism【11†L333-L340】. It triumphed in forming a universal community of believers, even as it invited criticism from those who saw in it a departure from the old paths【5†L77-L81】. 

Meanwhile, the apocalyptic visions of the New Testament (especially Revelation) tie back into these themes of covenant and rebellion in symbolic ways. The Beast’s **mark and number (666)** parody God’s sealing of His people, and the destructive angel Abaddon personifies the judgment reserved for a world in defiance. In these symbols we can vaguely discern echoes of earlier patterns – the danger of false worship and corrupted power that had plagued tribes like Dan and Benjamin in Israel’s story now writ large on the global stage. Yet, notably, **Benjamin is listed among the redeemed in Revelation**. Whatever one makes of the cryptogram 666, it ultimately serves as a warning against apostasy and misplaced allegiance, calling the faithful to wisdom and perseverance. 

Finally, the examination of Mark’s Gospel reminds us how the foundation of our faith – the resurrection of Jesus – was recorded and transmitted with both bold proclamation and reverent restraint. Mark’s original ending, ending in awe and ambiguity, preserves the raw astonishment of Easter morning【19†L119-L127】. It challenges us to trust the *spoken word* of the angel and seek the risen Christ in our own journey, rather than simply reading a neat ending on paper. The later ending affirms that the Lord did appear and commission His followers, harmonizing Mark with the manifest victory celebrated in the other Gospels. Both aspects together enrich our understanding: the resurrection is an event grounded in history (with multiple eyewitnesses) and at the same time a transcendent mystery that beckons each new reader to faith.

**In conclusion,** the threads connecting Benjamin, Paul, and the number 666 are subtle yet evocative. Benjamin’s legacy in prophecy and narrative sets the stage for both heroic deliverance and severe warning – themes that carry into the New Testament era. Paul the Benjamite carried the torch of Israel’s faith into the Gentile world, illuminating the path for countless believers even as his teachings became a dividing line regarding the Law’s role. And the apocalyptic imagery of Revelation, with its numbered names and destroyer angel, can be seen as a climactic canvas where the age-old struggles (faithfulness vs. idolatry, obedience vs. rebellion) reach their final resolution. All these elements, backed by scriptural and scholarly witness, paint a panorama of God’s redemptive plan unfolding through history. It’s a story where even the smallest tribe or the fiercest skeptic can be instrumental in God’s purpose – but also where failing to heed God’s covenant can lead to devastation. The call for us today is to learn from these patterns: to be faithful like the redeemed Benjamites rather than rebel like the Gibeah mob, to embrace the true Gospel of Christ as Paul preached (while understanding it in light of the whole counsel of Scripture), and to exercise wisdom and loyalty in a world marked by many “beastly” allurements【34†L178-L185】. In doing so, we join the great narrative that the Bible, from Numbers to Revelation, ultimately proclaims – the triumph of the Lamb of God and the inclusion of all who are *written in His book* rather than merely numbered by the world.
