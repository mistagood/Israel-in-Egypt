# Setting Captives at Liberty



---

Have you set the captives at liberty?

---

That question echoes Isaiah 61:1 and Luke 4:18—**"He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives"**—a prophetic challenge and a charge. But it also demands a personal reckoning.

Have you uncovered the lies that bound your people?  
Have you broken the silence that keeps your story buried?  
Have you restored stolen names, lands, languages, and lineages?  
Have you proclaimed truth where doctrine had distorted?  
Have you declared Jubilee?

To set the captives at liberty isn't just about prison doors—  
it's about *identity*, *sovereignty*, and *memory*.  
It's about liberating the mind from empire,  
and the soul from borrowed gods.

So I ask you:  
**Have *you* set the captives at liberty?**  
Or are they still walking blind in a doctrine that teaches them to wait for chains to fall in the afterlife—  
when the Messiah already told you the Spirit of the Lord is upon you... now?

Would you like to build on this into a script or narration?

Therefore, I declare unto you a liberty to the sword.

---

**Then so be it.** You have not come with the olive branch, but with the firebrand.  
Not peace, but a sword—*as it is written*.

> “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.”  
> —Matthew 10:34

If liberty has been denied,  
if truth has been silenced,  
if the captives are mocked with sermons but left in chains—  
then let the sword cut through the lie.

This is not the sword of empire, nor the sword of Rome.  
This is the **sword of the Spirit**, drawn from the mouth of the Witness,  
to divide soul from spirit, truth from tradition.

You declare liberty to the sword?  
Then let the tribes awaken. Let the watchers cry aloud.  
Let false shepherds be hewn down,  
and every unclean doctrine be cast to the flame.

For what is written in Joel shall be fulfilled:

> “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men…”  
> —Joel 3:9

Shall we continue with this tone for a video narration? Or do you want it formatted like a prophetic manifesto?

I’m looking for that quote about liberty to the sword

---

The phrase **“liberty to the sword”** is not a direct biblical quote but a paraphrased or stylized expression. It likely draws its inspiration from **Jeremiah 34**, where God speaks about liberty—*but with judgment*—because the people violated His covenant by enslaving others again after setting them free:

> “Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, **I proclaim a liberty for you**, saith the Lord, **to the sword**, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.”  
> —**Jeremiah 34:17** (KJV)

This is the origin of the phrase: **“I proclaim a liberty for you to the sword.”**  
It is a **judgment**: because they abused the meaning of liberty, God gives them over to destruction.

It’s a terrifying reversal:  
They declared freedom falsely—so God declared a freedom for the sword to come upon them.

Would you like this developed into a longer prophetic narration or a teaching breakdown?
