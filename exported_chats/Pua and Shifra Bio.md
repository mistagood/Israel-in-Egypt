**Character Bios: Pua and Shiphrah**  
*The Midwives Who Defied a King*

---

**Name:** Shiphrah (שִׁפְרָה)  
**Name Meaning:** "Beautiful," "Fairness," or "To improve" (from the Hebrew root *š-p-r*, to be fair or splendid)

**Name:** Puah (פּוּעָה)  
**Name Meaning:** Possibly "Splendid," "Fragrant blossom," or "One who cries out" (rooted in *pūaḥ*, meaning to breathe, cry out, or utter)

**Historical Period:**  
- Era of the Oppression of the Israelites in Egypt  
- Circa 15th–13th century BCE (if aligned with traditional dating of Exodus events)

**Biblical Appearance:**  
- **Exodus 1:15–21**  
- They are introduced as the Hebrew midwives in Egypt who are commanded by Pharaoh to kill all male Hebrew newborns at birth.

---

**Roles and Actions:**  
- **Midwives to the Hebrews:** Shiphrah and Puah served as caregivers at one of the most vulnerable moments in human life: childbirth. Their role was both medical and maternal, symbolizing life, continuity, and protection.
- **Moral Resistance:** When Pharaoh commanded the midwives to carry out infanticide against Hebrew boys, they **feared God more than the king** and refused. Instead, they protected life—perhaps inventing or at least reporting the claim that Hebrew women gave birth too quickly for them to intervene.
- **Divine Reward:** Because of their faithfulness and civil disobedience, God “made them houses” (Exodus 1:21). Interpretations vary:
  - **Literal:** God blessed them with families of their own.
  - **Figurative:** They became founders of enduring spiritual or priestly lineages.
  - **Political:** They were honored or elevated among the people as mothers of a new order.

---

**Character Traits:**  
- **Courageous:** They defied Pharaoh, one of the most powerful rulers in history.
- **God-fearing:** Their loyalty to divine law over human law is a cornerstone trait.
- **Compassionate and Nurturing:** As midwives, their identity is entwined with mercy and the preservation of life.
- **Wise and Strategic:** Their response to Pharaoh was tactful; they avoided direct confrontation while still achieving their mission.

---

**Possible Identities and Background:**  
- The Hebrew wording is ambiguous. Some scholars debate whether they were Hebrew midwives (Israelite women serving their own people) or Egyptian midwives who served the Hebrews. The more traditional interpretation aligns them as **Israelite women** standing up for their own.

**Symbolic Role in the Bible:**  
- They are **early models of resistance to unjust power**, acting in silent rebellion through life-giving service.
- Their story foreshadows Moses, whose survival would hinge on the defiance and bravery of women—his mother, sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter.
- They embody the theme of the **righteous remnant**: unknown, often unnamed by history, yet critical to the survival of the people.

---

**Legacy:**  
- Shiphrah and Puah are among the **first recorded civil rights heroes** in biblical history.
- They represent **female agency**, standing against systemic evil with no army, no weapon—only the moral force of their conviction and the sacredness of life.
- They echo through the narrative as a whisper of what righteousness looks like when the state demands blood: say no.
