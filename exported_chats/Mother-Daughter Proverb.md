Where in the Bible does it say that it will be a saying that as the mother is so is the daughter she gets it from the mother?

The phrase you are referring to can be found in the Book of Ezekiel. Specifically, it is located in Ezekiel 16:44, which states:

"Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: 'Like mother, like daughter.'" 

This verse is part of a larger passage where the prophet Ezekiel is delivering a message of judgment and warning to Jerusalem, using the metaphor of a faithless wife to describe the city's unfaithfulness to God. The proverb signifies the idea that daughters often inherit the traits and behaviors of their mothers.
