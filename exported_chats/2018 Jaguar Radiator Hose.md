Here’s what I found for identifying that coolant hose in your 2018 Jaguar radiator system:

### 🔍 Likely OEM Part Options

A genuine **upper radiator hose for 2018–2020 Jaguar XE/XF 3.0L**, part number **T4N18661**, closely matches what’s pictured — the correct twists, bends, and connector shapes, designed to fit the primary radiator assembly citeturn0search2turn0search7turn0search5.

Jaguar’s OEM coolant hose assemblies for F‑Pace, XE, XF, and XJ models typically include:

- **Upper hose** (radiator to coolant tank/outlet)  
- **Lower hose** (radiator to water pump inlet)

Photos on OEM parts sites show similar styling and connector angles as in your image citeturn0search0turn0search7.

If your engine is the 3.0L or 2.0L Ingenium, part **T4N18661** is an excellent match.

---

### 🛠 Replacement Options

Here are some ready-to-buy replacement hoses compatible with 2018 Jaguar (XE/XF with 3.0L engine):

products{"selections":[["turn0product5","Genuine Jaguar T4N18661 Radiator Hose (2018‑20 XE/XF 3.0L)"]],"tags":["OEM‑grade hose"]}

---

### 🧭 What to Do Next

1. **Confirm your engine type** — check if your Jaguar is the 3.0L V6.  
2. **Compare your existing hose** — line up your hose with vendor photos like T4N18661.  
3. **Inspect connector ends** — ensure clips, sensors, and diameter match exactly.

If your vehicle has the 2.0L engine (Ingenium), Jaguar part numbers T4A11770 (upper) or T4A13741 (assembly) are the corresponding OEM options citeturn0search0turn0search3.

---

### ✅ Summary

- The hose in your photo looks like a **primary upper radiator conduit**.
- Most likely matches:
  - **T4N18661** – upper radiator hose for 3.0L XE/XF (2018–2020)
  - **T4A11770** – upper radiator hose for 2.0L models
- Check engine type, verify shape/connectors, and order the correct OEM replacement.

Let me know your engine variant or any numbers stamped on the hose—happy to help confirm exact fit!
