# Reciprocal punishment examples

God often uses irony to punish people. In other words, when they're disobedient in the wilderness and they complain about meat, he gives them quail, he says, until it's coming out of their ears and they sin and he strikes them down. The prophets say, you're just God because they have shed blood and you've given them blood to drink. And so, there's a righteous retribution that comes. And so, there's always a connection with the punishment and with the action. Let's take a look at examples that we can find of this in the Bible, all the examples.

Since they desire goodly words and pleasant things, God gives it to them and they become snared to them. The same is said that if a prophet is a drunk or so forth, that this would be the prophet for this people. And so God is going to give them lying prophets who say things that they want to hear. We see it happening through the Bible, prophets that say things to please, but these people make the kings happy, they make the people happy. And so God gives them what they desire, lying prophets. And so Paul is the example of the one who tells people what they want to hear. And they follow him. But if we see the pattern, we know that God has given them the kind of prophet that they want so that it will become a snare and a stumbling block. And so Paul admits to this very thing. But people are blinded because of things formerly mentioned, because they feed on ashes, because they dig a pit out and so they have to fall into it.
