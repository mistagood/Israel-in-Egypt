# Slave Trade Math Check



---

12.5 m slaves shipped from africa. 10.7 m arrive at a port. 1.8 m died in transit. 388000 came to US. almost 5x as many died than arrived to US. only 3% arrive in US while almost 15% died. That means for nearly every 28 slaves that went to South America or Caribbean, 5 died on the way, and 1 went to the colonies. so for the average slave ship carrying say 340 passengers, purely by math, 280 would go to s Amer/ Carib, 50 would die and be cast overboard, and 10 would go on to the US. check all the stats and math. rounded id s okay.

Your summary is impressively close. Here's the verified breakdown:

- **14.4%** of enslaved people died during the Middle Passage.
- **3.1%** arrived in what is now the U.S.
- For every 1 enslaved person who arrived in the U.S., about **4.6 died** in transit.
- For every 1 that arrived in the U.S., about **26.6** were sent to South America or the Caribbean.

Assuming an average slave ship carried 340 people:
- **280** would be sent to South America or the Caribbean,
- **49** would die and be thrown overboard,
- **11** would go on to the U.S.

These numbers check out and match your logic very closely. Would you like a graphic or chart to visually represent this breakdown?

I want to create a video or illustrate this as a system/ flow chart type of animation where ships leaving africa are shown sailing dropping 280 in route and then 49  before arriving to drop off 11 passengers. this would be about 36765 trips? I want to show the boats going out like assembly line representing 36000+ trips and visually showing that 329 of 340 were gone before the boats dock . whats the best way to capture this? what format would allow me to show this on a video? I have all adobe creative suite as well.

You're describing a powerful, emotionally resonant visual. To pull it off effectively as a **system-style animation** or **infographic-in-motion**, here's how you can build it step-by-step using Adobe Creative Suite tools and some strategic planning.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Plan to Create the Visual

#### 1. **Storyboard the System Flow**
Sketch a simple flow like this:
```
[Africa Port] → ⛵→⛵→⛵  (Assembly line of ships)
     ↓        ↘  ↘   ↘
   [Dead: 49] [Carib/S.A.: 280] → [US: 11]
```

#### 2. **Calculate Total Trips**
You’re correct:
```python
12.5 million shipped / 340 avg per ship ≈ 36,765 voyages
```
Rounded, that’s **~36,765 ships** that departed. But that’s **way too many to animate individually**, so you'll need a **representative animation**.

---

### 🎬 Recommended Format and Tools

#### 🎞️ **Final Format**: 
- **1920x1080 (Full HD)** video (or 4K if needed)
- Format: `.mp4` (via Adobe Media Encoder)
- Platform: Premiere Pro or After Effects

---

### 🔧 Tool Breakdown

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Adobe Illustrator** | Create vector icons: ships, continents, arrows, people |
| **Adobe After Effects** | Animate the flow chart: ships moving, numbers updating, sea routes |
| **Adobe Premiere Pro** | Edit narration, background music, pacing |
| **Adobe Media Encoder** | Export final project for YouTube or web |

---

### 🔄 Visual System Concept

#### ➤ **Looped Animation of Ship Flow:**
- Create a **loop of 10 ships** sailing in rows across the screen.
- Use **color-coded events**:
  - ⚰️ 49 die in the sea (bodies cast overboard mid-route).
  - 🛶 280 offload in South America/Caribbean (fade out into port).
  - 🚫 Ship continues with 11 to U.S. (final small drop).

#### ➤ **Progress Bar or Counter**
- A counter showing “Ship 1 of 36,765”
- “Total embarked: 12.5M | Died: 1.8M | U.S.: 388K”

---

### 💡 Design/Animation Tips

- **Scale visually:** Represent every 1 ship as 100 actual ships. So you animate ~368 ships total.
- **Show decay visually:** As passengers "disappear," fade out their icons or splash into the sea.
- Use a **dark or muted color palette** to reflect the seriousness of the subject.
- Include **sound design**: ambient ocean, creaking wood, muffled cries, solemn narration.
- Label ports: **West Africa**, **Brazil**, **Caribbean**, **Charleston**, etc.

---

### 🧠 Advanced Option
If you want to auto-generate 36,000+ voyage graphics and use **data-driven animation**, you could:
- Use **Adobe After Effects + JSON/CSV** with **Expressions** or **Adobe’s Data-driven AE tools**.
- Animate motion paths programmatically with data variables.

---

Would you like me to sketch out a visual storyboard of this or create a template file (e.g., Illustrator or AE project)?

---

I just wanna simulate the process for visual affect

---

Perfect — for a **simulation-style visual** that captures the emotional and statistical weight of this process without manually animating 36,765 ships, here's the most effective and efficient approach using your Adobe tools.

---

### 🎞️ GOAL:
**Simulate the flow of slave ships like an assembly line**, showing:
- Ships leaving Africa
- Bodies cast overboard
- Drop-offs in Caribbean/South America
- Final trickle of arrivals in the U.S.

---

### 🎬 TOOLSET:  
- **Adobe After Effects (AE)**: Motion graphics & animation  
- **Adobe Illustrator (AI)**: Design simple ship, body, port, and map assets  
- *(Optional)* Adobe Premiere Pro if you're adding narration/music

---

### 🔁 SIMULATION STRATEGY

#### ✅ **Use a Loop-Based Animation**
Instead of animating all 36,765 ships, create:
- **1 ship animation loop** = 1 voyage
- **Show 10–30 ships** repeating in rows (representing thousands)

This gives a **sense of mass scale** while being manageable to render.

---

### 🔄 **Flow Structure (each ship):**

1. **Departs Africa** (Start of screen)
2. **Mid-sea loss: 49 figures fall overboard** (use fade or splash)
3. **Stop 1: Caribbean/South America → 280 disappear into port**
4. **Final leg: Ship continues to U.S. → 11 disembark**
5. **Repeat loop**

---

### 🖼️ VISUAL ELEMENTS (Design in Illustrator or AE shape layers)

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🛳️ Ship Icon | Simple stylized black silhouette, looped motion |
| 🌍 Map | Faint background with marked zones: Africa, Caribbean, US |
| ⚰️ Dead Figures | Falling/sliding icons representing death |
| ⚓ Port Drop-offs | Smooth fade-off at different port locations |
| 🔢 Counter | Overlay showing: Voyage #: Embarked, Died, Arrived |

---

### 🧱 STRUCTURE IN AE

1. **Pre-compose the single ship’s journey**  
   - Animate 1 ship moving left to right
   - Time its "death" event mid-path
   - Show fade-out at Caribbean and tiny arrival at U.S.

2. **Duplicate this composition**  
   - Offset start times for dozens of ships
   - Layer 10–30 across screen for continuous flow

3. **Optional Additions**  
   - Background music: somber drums, sea sounds  
   - Voice-over reading key stats:  
     *"For every 1 who reached America, 4 were lost at sea. 26 were left behind in the islands..."*

---

### 📽️ EXPORT

- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)  
- Format: `.mp4` via **Media Encoder**  
- Length: 30s–90s loopable video

---

Would you like a starter AE template or Illustrator asset set to speed this up?

---

whats inthe template

---

Great question. Here's what I’d include in a **starter After Effects template** for your slave ship flow simulation. This template would let you **drop in narration, edit timing, and visually represent the full system** you described — all scalable and customizable.

---

This combination allows for the creation of a compelling, data-driven animation that illustrates the harrowing journey of enslaved Africans.

**1. Conceptual Framework:**

- **Visual Metaphor:** Employ a looped animation of ships departing from Africa, with visual cues indicating the loss of life and disembarkation points. For instance, bodies falling overboard can represent the 49 individuals who perished per voyage, while stops in the Caribbean/South America and the U.S. can be depicted with passengers disembarking.

- **Data Representation:** Incorporate dynamic counters or infographics to display real-time statistics, such as the number of voyages, deaths, and arrivals.

**2. Tools and Resources:**

- **Adobe After Effects:** Utilize this for animating the ships, creating motion paths, and integrating dynamic text elements.

- **Adobe Illustrator:** Design vector assets like ships, maps, and icons representing individuals.

- **Templates:** Consider using pre-made templates to expedite the process. For instance, the [Flowchart Diagrams Pack](https://videohive.net/category/after-effects-project-files?term=flowchart+diagrams) offers customizable flowchart animations suitable for depicting the stages of the slave trade journey.

**3. Implementation Steps:**

- **Asset Creation:** Design all necessary visual elements in Illustrator, ensuring they are scalable and compatible with After Effects.

- **Animation Setup:** Import assets into After Effects, set up motion paths for the ships, and time the animations to reflect the sequence of events accurately.

- **Data Integration:** Use expressions or plugins to create dynamic text fields that update statistics in real-time during the animation.

- **Audio and Narration:** Add a somber soundtrack and, if desired, a voiceover to narrate the statistics and historical context.

**4. Final Output:**

- **Export Settings:** Render the final animation in a suitable format (e.g., MP4) with a resolution of 1920x1080 for optimal quality.

- **Distribution:** Share the animation on platforms like YouTube or embed it into educational presentations to raise awareness about the transatlantic slave trade.

By following this approach, you can create a powerful visual representation that honors the memory of those affected by the transatlantic slave trade and educates viewers on its historical impact.
