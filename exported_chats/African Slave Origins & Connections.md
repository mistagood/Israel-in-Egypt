# African Slave Origins & Connections



---



---

Where in Africa did the 388,000 Africans who were imported to North America originate from? trace the lineage of those slaves who were brought here and see where they came from before the gate of no return. It seems that the means of capturing and selling slaves would have been finding or raiding tribes who were nomadic or on the borders of established territories. Is it possible that christian jews or Israelites were migrating, settling or mixing They would’ve been easy pickings for the tribes who were dealing with the slave traders. Could this have been the very same people who are driven out of Jerusalem and were then being persecuted? Explore these notions through looking through historical records and migrations, historical events, etc. that may give us an idea to begin the build a historical timeline from the fall of the temple in 70A.D. until slavery began in earnest with the north Atlantic slave trade to see if we can see where is the slaves came from

Certainly, the inquiry you present demands a thorough examination of historical, cultural, and theological frameworks. We will begin by identifying the regions from where the Africans were transported to North America and then explore the possibility of their connections with Christian Jews or Israelites.

### Origin and Lineage

The 388,000 Africans brought to North America predominantly hailed from West and Central Africa. The regions included the Bight of Biafra, the Gold Coast, the Bight of Benin, and Senegambia (Eltis & Richardson, 2010).

1. **Senegambia**: This region comprised modern-day Senegal and Gambia. Many slaves from this region belonged to the Wolof and Serer tribes.
2. **Gold Coast**: Modern-day Ghana was a major source, with the Akan and Asante tribes being prominent.
3. **Bight of Benin**: This includes parts of modern-day Nigeria and Benin, with significant populations from the Yoruba and Igbo tribes.
4. **Bight of Biafra**: This region covered parts of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon, with the Igbo and Efik tribes being notable.

### Nomadic Tribes and Vulnerability to Slave Traders

It is indeed plausible that nomadic tribes or those along the borders were more susceptible to capture. Societies with less centralized political structures may have been more vulnerable to slave raids (Thornton, 1998).

### Possible Connection to Christian Jews or Israelites

The connection between the enslaved Africans and the Christian Jews or Israelites requires careful examination of historical migrations and religious affiliations. Some West African tribes, particularly the Igbo, have claimed descent from the lost tribes of Israel (Bruder, 2008). 

The notion of migration and mixing of these groups with the persecuted individuals driven out of Jerusalem could be seen as an extension of diasporic movements. However, concrete evidence is scarce, and connecting the historical timeline from the fall of the temple in 70 A.D. to the commencement of the North Atlantic slave trade is a complex task.

### Conclusion

The lineage of enslaved Africans brought to North America originates from diverse regions within West and Central Africa. Their vulnerability could be connected to nomadic lifestyles or border settlements. While intriguing, the theory that they might have included Christian Jews or Israelites migrating or settling requires further research. Examining historical records, migratory patterns, and religious traditions might reveal hidden connections, but the complexity of this inquiry necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, weaving theology, history, and cultural anthropology.

Your hypothesis ignites a provocative conversation that could serve as an inspiration for further scholarly research. By exploring the interplay between historical events and biblical narratives, we might uncover the profound intersections between human experience, divine providence, and cultural identity, in the context of the African diaspora.

The idea of mixing refers to the Hebrews intermingling with the African tribes. Who are the Canaanites in the Bible? Are they considered Africans in the modern sense?

The Canaanites are a significant group in the Bible, and their identity and possible intermingling with Hebrews present an intriguing area of study.

### The Canaanites in the Bible

In the biblical narrative, the Canaanites were the inhabitants of Canaan, an area that covered modern-day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, western Jordan, and parts of Syria. They were often depicted as enemies or rivals of the Israelites, with numerous conflicts recorded in the Old Testament (Joshua 3-12).

The Canaanites were described as descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham, one of Noah's sons (Genesis 10:6). Their civilization was marked by city-states, and they are credited with advances in metallurgy, agriculture, and the Phoenician alphabet.

### Connection to Africa

The classification of the Canaanites as "Africans" in the modern sense is more complex. The term "Africa" as a continental identity is a product of modern classification. While the Canaanites' territory was geographically close to North Africa, it was culturally and historically distinct.

Ham's descendants in the Bible were associated with various regions, including parts of Africa such as Egypt and Cush (Nubia). Thus, some have linked Hamitic people to African lineage, but this connection has been contentious and has led to various misunderstandings and misinterpretations, especially during the era of slavery (Goldenberg, 2005).

### Intermingling with Hebrews

The Bible does describe interactions between the Canaanites and the Israelites. Some texts suggest marriages and alliances (Judges 3:5-6), while others, such as the laws in Deuteronomy 7:1-5, explicitly prohibit intermingling.

The relationship between the Canaanites and Israelites might resonate with the theoretical framework of your research, particularly in understanding how different groups might mix, reconcile, or conflict within the larger context of sacred history and human experience.

### Conclusion

The Canaanites, as described in the Bible, were a complex and influential group residing in the region known as Canaan. While they were not "African" in the modern sense, their connection to Ham has led some to associate them with African lineage. The interactions between the Canaanites and Hebrews provide a rich tapestry for exploring themes of cultural mixing, conflict, and reconciliation.
