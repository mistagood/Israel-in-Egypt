The name **Chezib (כְּזִיב)** appears in Genesis 38:5:

> “And she yet again bare a son; and called his name **Shelah**: and he was at **Chezib**, when she bare him.” — *Genesis 38:5, KJV*

---

### Meaning of "Chezib"

The Hebrew name **Chezib** (כְּזִיב, *Keziv*) derives from the root **כזב (kazav)**, which means **to lie**, **to disappoint**, or **to fail**. Therefore, **Chezib** most likely means:

> **“Falsehood,” “deception,” or “disappointment.”**

Some lexicons and scholarly sources expand on this to render meanings such as:

- “Deceptive place”
- “A place of false hope”
- “Lying” or “unfulfilled promise”

---

### Symbolic Implication

Chezib’s name is deeply symbolic in the context of Genesis 38, which narrates Judah’s departure from his brothers, his marriage to a Canaanite woman, and the birth of his sons. Shelah, the third son, is born at Chezib — a town whose very name signals **disappointment or deceit**. This aligns prophetically with Judah’s later failure to give Shelah to Tamar as a husband, as he had promised (Genesis 38:11, 14, 26). Tamar was thus **deceived**, mirroring the meaning of **Chezib**.

### Additional Appearances

Chezib is also mentioned in:

> **Joshua 15:44** — as a town allotted to the tribe of Judah.

Later biblical references and rabbinic traditions identify it with **Achzib** (אַכְזִיב), a coastal town in the territory of Asher (Joshua 19:29), also from the same root **kazav** (to lie or disappoint). This reinforces a recurring theme: towns named from this root are associated with **betrayal, false promises, or failed deliverance**.

### Summary

| Term      | Hebrew     | Root      | Meaning                        |
|-----------|------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Chezib    | כְּזִיב     | כזב (*kazav*) | Lie, deception, disappointment |
| Usage     | Genesis 38:5, Joshua 15:44 |      | Birthplace of Shelah; Town in Judah |
| Symbolism | Spiritual and prophetic failure |      | Foreshadowing Judah’s broken vow to Tamar |

If you're connecting this with typology or prophetic parallels in the house of Judah, Chezib marks a turning point — a *false resting place*, an *illusion of completion* that is soon undone.
