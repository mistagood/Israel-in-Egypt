# Cannabis Retailer Complaint DCC



---

Who is in charge of complaints about cannabis retailers that are not following the law? Specifically, there is a store who is taking advantage of the Compassion Program by having clients with disabilities sign up for the Compassion Program and they receive the donations but are keeping them for themselves and or denying customers who have signed up for it the product because of favoritism basically or they're giving it to their friends illegally.

Thanks. Now, help me to detail this complaint. My son has a disability and I've signed up for the Compassion Program at ERBA. At first, they were very helpful as they told me about the program and helped me to sign up. I was told at that time that they only have one other customer who received it and the manager at the time told me that she would save up the packages for this person because they were allowed to get eight grams a day. So, she would save them up for 30 days and the person would come in from Las Vegas, Nevada and she would give them to them and they would transport them back to Las Vegas. This was happening on a monthly basis. Once I signed up, the company began to send additional resources specifically for me as this is the way that I understand the program works and I was told what happened. For a while, I would receive it but after a while, they began to tell me that they didn't have it and I would call ahead and I would be told on the phone that they had it but once I got there and they saw it was me, they would say they didn't have it or that they couldn't find it. After a while, I was finally told that I was coming too often and that they needed to save some for other customers because they wanted to spread it out. Now, if it had been sent specifically for me and allotted to me, then they should have given me that but beyond that, I was then told by the same manager that they had over 100 customers who received it and that they needed to make it last. This is ridiculous because for each person that signs up, they would potentially send more. The truth is that she was sending it out of town to her friend as she had told me. She had a friend who lived in Vegas who would come and pick it up and so after a while, I went to the other Herba location where I signed up and waited a few days and the shipments arrived for me but once the staff realized that I was the same person from the other store because some of them work at both stores, the same thing began to happen and they didn't have any for me. So currently, I have not received any of the compassion donations in months and even when I go in, they tell me that they have none. So my son has autism and has used this for regulating behaviors and mood and it has been greatly helpful but because of their lack of compassion, it's caused us great distress. Now, I had my other son go in when he was caregiving for my son and sign up and pick up the compassion. I had already suspected what was happening but now without knowing that it was my son, the person at the counter admitted to him that they didn't have 100 people. He said, we only have one other guy who comes but we had to cut him off because he comes too much. So you're good to go. We got you. This regulation of the supplies that were sent specifically for us after we signed up seems like a violation of the spirit and the legality of the program. Not only is it the opposite of compassion, it's unethical. The store is taking advantage of the program for their own benefit. you

Here’s a detailed draft of your complaint, formatted to ensure clarity and focus on the key issues:

**Complaint Submission: Mismanagement of Compassion Program at ERBA**

**Subject:** Alleged unethical practices and misuse of the Compassion Program resources at ERBA cannabis retailer.

**Details of the Incident:**

1. **Background and Initial Engagement:**  
   My son has autism, and I initially signed up for ERBA's Compassion Program to access cannabis donations intended to support his needs. At the time of sign-up, the manager explained the program and assured me that resources would be allocated specifically for participants. Initially, my experience was positive, and the staff were helpful in providing the donations as promised.

2. **Irregularities Observed:**  
   - I was informed by the manager that only one other customer was receiving the Compassion Program benefits at that location. This individual, residing in Las Vegas, Nevada, would allegedly collect donations saved over 30 days and transport them out of state monthly.  
   - After my enrollment, I understood that additional resources were sent specifically for me, as is standard for the program. However, I began encountering issues:  
     - On several occasions, I called ahead to confirm availability, was told they had the donations, but upon arriving, staff would deny having them or claim they were unable to locate them.  
     - Later, I was told I was "coming too often" and that donations needed to be "spread out for other customers," despite the program sending donations specifically for me.

3. **Contradictions and Suspected Misuse:**  
   - The manager's explanation shifted over time: initially, there were “only two customers,” then later, there were “over 100 customers.” This inconsistency raises concerns about transparency.  
   - The same manager admitted previously to setting aside packages for an out-of-state individual, indicating favoritism and potentially illegal interstate transport of cannabis.  

4. **Ongoing Denial of Resources:**  
   - After being denied donations at the initial location, I visited a second ERBA location where I had also signed up. For a short time, I was able to receive donations there until staff recognized me as being from the other location. Once identified, the same pattern of denial resumed.  
   - Currently, I have not received Compassion Program donations in months despite being an eligible participant.

5. **Key Witness and Admission of Misconduct:**  
   - To verify my suspicions, my other son, acting as a caregiver for his brother, signed up for the program and attempted to collect donations. Without realizing the relationship, staff disclosed to him that:  
     - "We only have one other guy who comes, but we had to cut him off because he comes too much. You’re good to go."  
   - This admission directly contradicts prior claims of having 100+ participants and highlights mismanagement of the program.

**Impact on My Family:**  
The lack of access to Compassion Program donations has caused significant distress for my family. These resources have been vital in regulating my son’s behaviors and mood, and their absence has disrupted his care. ERBA’s actions—denying allocated resources, showing favoritism, and mismanaging program benefits—go against the spirit of compassion and the ethical framework of the program.

**Request for Investigation:**  
I am requesting a thorough investigation into ERBA’s management of the Compassion Program, particularly regarding:  
- The accurate number of participants in the program.  
- Whether donations intended for participants are being redirected or withheld improperly.  
- Any favoritism or illegal transport of cannabis donations, as described by the manager.  

This misuse of a program designed to help individuals with disabilities is unethical and potentially illegal. I believe these practices undermine the integrity of the Compassion Program and require immediate attention to protect other participants and uphold the program’s intent.

correction: the program I signed up for is through Emerald Bay, a company Erba works very closely with as one of their distributors. They send the donations and erba should give them to us. But they are witholding

Here is the revised draft incorporating the correction about Emerald Bay's involvement:

**Complaint Submission: Mismanagement of Compassion Program Donations at ERBA**

**Subject:** Alleged unethical practices and misuse of Compassion Program donations distributed through Emerald Bay at ERBA cannabis retailer.

**Details of the Incident:**

1. **Background and Initial Engagement:**  
   My son has autism, and I signed up for the Compassion Program facilitated by Emerald Bay, whose donations are distributed through ERBA. These donations are intended to support individuals like my son, providing much-needed resources for his care. When I first signed up, ERBA staff were helpful, explaining the program and assisting me in enrolling.

2. **Irregularities Observed:**  
   - I was initially informed by ERBA’s manager that only one other customer was receiving donations through the program. This individual, residing in Las Vegas, Nevada, would allegedly collect donations saved over 30 days and transport them out of state monthly.  
   - After my enrollment, Emerald Bay began sending additional resources specifically for me, as is standard for the program. However, I began encountering issues:  
     - On multiple occasions, I called ahead to confirm the availability of donations and was told they were in stock. However, when I arrived in person, staff either denied having the donations or claimed they could not locate them.  
     - Later, I was told I was "coming too often" and that donations needed to be "spread out for other customers," despite the program sending donations specifically for me.

3. **Contradictions and Suspected Misuse:**  
   - The manager’s explanations shifted inconsistently: initially, there were “only two customers,” but later, I was told there were “over 100 customers” receiving Compassion Program donations. This inconsistency raises serious concerns about transparency.  
   - The manager admitted previously to setting aside packages for an out-of-state individual, indicating favoritism and potentially illegal interstate transport of cannabis donations.  

4. **Ongoing Denial of Resources:**  
   - After being denied donations at the initial ERBA location, I visited a second location where I was also registered for the program. For a short time, I was able to receive donations there, but this stopped once staff realized I was the same person from the first location.  
   - Since then, I have not received any donations in months, despite being an eligible participant under the Emerald Bay Compassion Program.

5. **Key Witness and Admission of Misconduct:**  
   - To verify my suspicions, my other son, acting as a caregiver for his brother, signed up for the program and attempted to collect donations. Without realizing the relationship, ERBA staff disclosed to him that:  
     - "We only have one other guy who comes, but we had to cut him off because he comes too much. You’re good to go."  
   - This statement contradicts prior claims of having 100+ participants and highlights ERBA’s mismanagement and possible withholding of program benefits.

**Impact on My Family:**  
The withholding of Compassion Program donations has caused significant distress for my family. These resources are essential for regulating my son’s behaviors and mood, and their absence has disrupted his care. ERBA’s actions—denying allocated resources, showing favoritism, and mismanaging program benefits—are contrary to the spirit and ethical framework of the Compassion Program as administered by Emerald Bay.

**Request for Investigation:**  
I am requesting a thorough investigation into ERBA’s handling of Emerald Bay’s Compassion Program donations, specifically regarding:  
- The accurate number of participants receiving donations.  
- Whether donations allocated for specific individuals are being withheld or redirected improperly.  
- Any favoritism or improper transport of cannabis donations, as described by the manager.

Emerald Bay’s Compassion Program was established to assist individuals with disabilities, and ERBA’s misuse of these resources undermines the program’s integrity. Immediate attention is needed to ensure that participants like my son receive the resources they are entitled to.

isnt it the states compassion program? please verify and correct the logic

I apologize for any confusion. In California, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (Proposition 215) allows patients with a valid physician's recommendation to use medical cannabis. However, specific Compassion Programs, like the one offered by Emerald Bay Extracts, are privately operated initiatives designed to provide free or discounted cannabis products to qualifying patients. These programs are not state-administered but are instead managed by individual companies or organizations within the cannabis industry.

Emerald Bay Extracts, for instance, has launched a Compassionate RSO Program aimed at providing qualified pediatric cancer patients with free access to high-quality RSO products. They also donate around 10,000 units of products per year to other compassionate programs throughout the state, which are managed at the retail level. citeturn0search1turn0search5

Emerald Bay Extracts, along with other companies, often facilitates privately managed Compassion Programs under the larger framework of California's Compassionate Use Act. These programs rely on participating retailers like ERBA to properly distribute donations to eligible patients. If ERBA is failing to comply with these arrangements, it reflects a violation of the privately managed program’s integrity rather than a direct state-run initiative.

The mismanagement still warrants a complaint, and you should direct it to both Emerald Bay Extracts (as the program provider) and the California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), which oversees the legal compliance of cannabis retailers in the state. Let me know if you want to further refine the draft complaint!
