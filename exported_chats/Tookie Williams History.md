history of the crips formation

---

Here is a clear and concise summary of the **formation of the Crips gang**, focusing on its origins, motives, and early development:

---

### **History of the Crips Formation**

**Founded:** 1969–1971  
**Founders:** **Raymond Washington** (East Side) and **Stanley "Tookie" Williams** (West Side)  
**Location:** Los Angeles, California  
**Original Name:** *Baby Avenues* or *Avenue Cribs* (later shortened to “Crips”)

---

### **Context:**

- The Crips emerged during a time of intense racial inequality, urban poverty, and community disintegration in South Central Los Angeles.
- In the late 1960s, the **Black Panther Party** was being dismantled by COINTELPRO and police crackdowns, leaving a power vacuum in many Black communities.
- With the loss of organized political movements, young Black men began forming neighborhood-based crews for identity, protection, and influence.

---

### **Founding:**

#### **Raymond Washington**  
- A teenager from South Central LA, Raymond was influenced by local street culture and the legacy of the Panthers.  
- In **1969**, he formed a gang called the *Baby Avenues* to emulate and eventually rival the older Avenue Boys gang.  
- His group initially had a goal of protecting the community but soon turned to **violent enforcement and reputation-building**.

#### **Stanley "Tookie" Williams**  
- A bodybuilder and street figure from West LA, Tookie joined forces with Raymond Washington around **1971**.
- Together, they unified various smaller street cliques into one powerful alliance: **the Crips**.
- The name “Crips” is often said to be derived from “Cribs,” symbolizing their youth, though others speculate it came from “crippled” (a term tied to their walk and swagger).

---

### **Expansion and Violence:**

- By the early 1970s, the Crips began spreading rapidly throughout Los Angeles and into other cities.
- Rival crews who refused to join the Crips banded together to form a rival group: the **Bloods**, initiating one of the most infamous and deadly gang rivalries in American history.
- What began as a form of community identity became synonymous with **drug trafficking, turf wars, and violence**—especially during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s.

---

### **Key Characteristics in Early Years:**

- **Colors:** Blue (Crips) vs. Red (Bloods)  
- **Structure:** Loosely organized sets; no central leadership  
- **Activities:** Intimidation, extortion, assaults, robberies, later drug trafficking  
- **Symbols:** Six-point stars, blue bandanas, graffiti tags (e.g., “Rollin’ 60s Crip”)

---

### **Legacy and Modern Evolution:**

- The Crips grew into a national and even international organization, with thousands of members and hundreds of “sets” across the U.S.
- Some members and former members have since attempted to redirect the gang’s influence toward **community activism, peacemaking, and youth outreach**, especially in the wake of Tookie Williams' transformation.

Would you like a timeline, map of set expansions, or a comparison of Crips vs. Bloods origins and values?

---

	•	Symbols: Six-point stars, blue bandanas,... Say more about the history of these symbols and anything we know about the origin and any evidence of this, everything that we know about these two things.

---

Absolutely. Here's a thorough breakdown of the **Crips’ use of the six-point star and the blue bandana**, their **origins**, symbolic meanings, and the **evidence we have** about how and why these symbols became part of Crip culture.

---

## 🔵 CRIPS SYMBOLS: BLUE BANDANA & SIX-POINT STAR

---

### 1. **The Blue Bandana**

#### 📌 **Origins:**
- The **blue bandana** is the **most recognizable symbol of Crip identity**, worn as a headband, pocket flag, or around the neck.
- The **adoption of blue** as the gang’s official color is widely attributed to **Stanley “Tookie” Williams**, one of the Crip co-founders. Several accounts state that he favored wearing **blue Levi’s and blue bandanas**, which influenced others in the gang.

#### 🧵 **Why Blue?**
- Theories vary, but most agree it started as a **personal preference** by influential early members and evolved into a **gang-wide color code**.
- Some rumors suggest the blue bandana was chosen to honor a Crip member who was shot and killed while wearing blue, but this remains anecdotal with no firm documentation.
- Another possibility is that blue was chosen to **distinguish themselves** from rival gangs, especially the **Bloods**, who later adopted red in opposition.

#### 🧠 **Symbolic Meaning:**
- Over time, the blue bandana came to represent:
  - **Loyalty** to the set
  - **Territorial control**
  - A **signal of identity** and intimidation
- In prison, color-coded bandanas also became a way to **identify alliances** in racial or gang conflicts.

#### 🔎 **Evidence:**
- Historical gang databases (like those used by LAPD gang units) and numerous law enforcement reports from the 1980s-1990s document **bandana color-coding** as part of Crip and Blood identity.
- In popular culture, including music videos, interviews, and autobiographies (like Tookie Williams' writings), the blue bandana is consistently mentioned.

---

### 2. **The Six-Point Star**

#### 🟦 **What It Is:**
- The **six-pointed star** is most commonly associated with the **Star of David**, a traditional Jewish symbol.
- In Crip usage, it has been **recontextualized** as a **symbol of structure, order, and power**—though not religious.

#### 📚 **Origins in Gang Culture:**
- The six-point star's entry into Crip iconography is **not original to the Crips**. It is **borrowed** from the **Folk Nation**, a larger gang alliance founded in Chicago in the late 1970s.
- The Crips and Folk Nation are **not officially allied**, but in some regions, particularly outside California (e.g., the Midwest), Crip sets have **adopted similar symbols** to align with **shared anti-Blood sentiments** or for organizational unity.
- **People Nation** gangs (aligned with the Bloods) use the **five-point star**, while **Folk Nation** uses the **six-point**. This oppositional symbolism has been widely adopted by Crips in various regions—**even though it wasn't part of the original LA Crips identity.**

#### 🔀 **When Did the Crips Start Using It?**
- The **original LA Crips** did **not** use the six-point star at their founding. The symbol appears more prominently in **later graffiti, tattoos, and prison markings**, particularly **after the Crips expanded** outside of California in the 1980s–1990s.
- It's often seen in **Crip-affiliated sets** in the **Midwest and Southern U.S.**, where Folk Nation’s influence is stronger.
- So this symbol is **regionally variable**: not all Crips use it, but where it appears, it reflects **inter-gang communication and alliance systems.**

#### 🧠 **Symbolic Meaning for Crips:**
- The six-point star in Crip iconography is redefined to represent:
  - **Life principles or codes**, like Love, Life, Loyalty, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding
  - **Opposition to five-point star gangs** (e.g., Bloods, Vice Lords)

#### 🔎 **Evidence:**
- Documented in:
  - **Gang tattoo guides**, prison intelligence reports, and law enforcement gang task force materials
  - Graffiti analysis in gang-controlled areas
  - Interviews with former gang members and researchers (e.g., in academic works and documentaries)

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Symbol         | Origin                            | Meaning                                 | Regionally Used By |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Blue Bandana   | Tookie Williams, early Crips (1970s) | Loyalty, unity, Crip identity             | All Crip sets      |
| Six-Point Star | Adopted from Folk Nation (1980s+) | Structure, opposition to five-point stars | Some Crip sets (esp. Midwest, South) |

---

Would you like imagery, graffiti samples, or a deeper comparison between Folk/People Nation systems and how they influenced Crip/Blood culture outside LA?

---

Okay, this takes us into another region. I asked about the origins and the founding of it, and you gave me this star symbol as if that was relevant to the gangs that started this, as if this was their symbol. So I'm glad I asked for clarity because you made it seem like this was something that is highly associated with Crips, and it's virtually unknown in the West Coast where the Crips began.

---

You're absolutely right to point that out—and your correction is critical for accurate historical clarity.

### ✅ Clarification: The Six-Point Star Is **Not** a Foundational Crip Symbol

The **six-point star** is **not associated with the original Crips** formed by **Raymond Washington and Stanley "Tookie" Williams** in **Los Angeles** in the early 1970s. That symbol became **regionally relevant much later**, and mostly **outside California**—primarily in the **Midwest and South**, where local Crip sets began aligning themselves with the **Folk Nation**, which does use the six-point star.

---

### 🔍 Let’s Recenter on the Founding Symbols and Identity of the Crips:

#### 1. **Founding Identity (1970s LA):**
- The **Crips started as loosely organized neighborhood sets** united more by **reputation, physical presence, street warfare, and dress** than by esoteric symbols.
- The early “symbolism” was expressed more through:
  - **Color (blue)**
  - **Bandanas, khaki pants, blue Chuck Taylors**
  - **Specific walking styles ("Crip walk")**
  - **Graffiti tags of set names (e.g., Rollin’ 60s, East Coast Crips, Westside Crips)**

#### 2. **The Blue Bandana – The Only Authentic Symbol from the Start:**
- **Blue was the true foundational identifier** for the original Crip sets in LA.
- The blue bandana was worn **to unify** members across different neighborhoods.
- There is no evidence in early police records or memoirs (including Tookie Williams' own writings) that the six-point star was **ever** used or endorsed in the founding Crip structure.

---

### 📌 The Six-Point Star Was *Later Imported*:

- As Crip identity **spread eastward** in the 1980s–1990s, particularly into **Chicago, Detroit, Memphis**, and beyond, **local interpretations of Crip identity merged with pre-existing gang alliances**, especially the **Folk Nation**.
- This led to the **retrofitting** of symbols like the six-point star onto Crip sets **that were not originally founded with them**.
- In this way, the star is not a Crip **foundational symbol**, but a **regional adaptation**.

---

### 🔄 Why the Confusion Happens:
- Law enforcement gang guides and media often **conflate regional adaptations with original symbols**, which leads to the misunderstanding that the six-point star is a core Crip identity marker.
- In truth, **West Coast Crips rarely—if ever—use the six-point star**, and many would not recognize it as part of their heritage.

---

### ✅ Summary of What’s Truly Foundational:
| Feature | Part of Original LA Crips? | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Blue bandana | ✅ Yes | Associated with Tookie, became core identifier |
| Set-specific graffiti | ✅ Yes | Rollin' 60s, East Coast, Compton Crips, etc. |
| Six-point star | ❌ No | Introduced via Folk Nation influence later |
| Crip Walk | ✅ Yes | Developed as a form of dance and coded movement |
| Six principles (e.g., Love, Life...) | ❌ No | Attributed to Midwest sets later under Folk ideology |

Terminator vs Tookie: Execution Day 
Things to know for this project. We are looking at a form of art and truth telling to bring these historical situations into new teachings and package them in different ways. Some as drama, some as parody, but in ways that will allow us to reinterpret and understand what the media has done in context of their fight for what we might call the beast in this situation where we know that COINTELPRO was using the media to paint a portrait of black men and to influence the public to see black men as criminals so that they wouldn't have the mainstream to join up with them. So in our story we're looking at a dystopian future where the reality of our world and media events have come to play in the real public and we're in the future. So in other words you have a woman who sued or who wrote what became The Matrix and The Terminator and so this black woman was not accredited for the short stories that she wrote. Hollywood just took her work. They say that you know that is debunked that she didn't write these things but we do have the actual evidence that she wrote these short stories and so we're looking at that very phenomena writ large in society and so she writes about the future they take it from her and create their own future in which black people are suppressed and what is theirs is taken from them and other people benefit from it. So in the movie you have a place called Zion and it's full of black people. Now originally we know that they wanted Will Smith to play this role so Neo the savior the one is supposed to be black but instead we have a white actor who has become the savior and in real life has gone on to become one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood when initially he was considered as a person who was very   and still is given very few lines when it comes to writing. So we're really parodying, parodying, but we're bringing a very serious message. And the message is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Terminator, the system, the machine that sent to crush the resistance. And the resistance to the oppression in the United States was in the form of the Crips and the Bloods, the street gangs, the Black Panthers, before they flooded them with drugs and FBI informants and see, you know, and the CIA and all these people were internationally working to bring drugs in and to oppress them to stop them from working with leaders of other nations, assassinating all of the leaders. And so the machine was working and using the media technology to defeat the resistance. And so in our story, Tookie Williams emerges as a virtual Samson figure. And here, on the tails of the Black Panther movement, the Crips begin their own empowered movement of community restoration, but they're quickly engaged by the invisible FBI and government forces who are already so much more prepared for dealing with groups like this than the Crips could imagine. And so they have international forces, the system bearing down on them, bringing things into the neighborhood and that are going to destroy them. So the idea is that the machine, the Terminator, the machine sends back a Terminator from a dystopian future in which this war is still raging on. And they send the Terminator to kill the leader of the resistance before it gets started. And so, of course, this means that they need to kill Tookie Williams. And if they can't kill him as a baby, if they can't kill him there, then they need to find a way to destroy him. And so the historical event of Arnold Schwarzenegger being the person who refused clemency, denying the clemency of this historic figure who's for years been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and is a major symbol of reformation and what can become of the possibility of an individual and therefore the resistance hope. And so the Terminator's job ultimately is to crush that hope, crush the hope of the resistance and the possibility of a leader forming up the building up the armies of the Lord. And so that's what they want to stop is the building up of the armies of the Lord. And so here we have a future of Zion where all the people are black and yet the machines are trying to destroy it. And so we're looking at both the Matrix and the Terminator and we're looking at where we are now, where we're going to, you know, because we're still, this is heating up now with the wars that are happening, the imbalances, the everything that's going on, it's coming to a boiling point. And so here we are again. And so the machine, we're going to drop back into time, a movie where they've sent the machine, the Terminator, we're going back to 2005, the Terminator, they've sent the machine, the Terminator, we're going back to 2005, the Terminator from a dystopian future where black people know who they are and the gangs have turned into the 12 tribes and the flags that they were wearing as blue rags have been remembered as the tassels and the blue ribbon that Moses commanded them and the armies have formed up and they know who they are and the 12 tribes and the Judah and Ephraim have become one hand in the stick, the one stick in the hand, and so they're batting down their enemies. And so the machines have sent back the Terminator to 2005 in order to kill the leader of this resistance before he can be seen as a possibility, a picture of hope from what people can come from or he can be exonerated and maybe his innocence is really what it's about. Maybe he was set up. Maybe this was part of the ploy to destroy him. Who knows? But...

User is working on a creative storytelling project titled *"Terminator vs. Tookie: Execution Day"*, which is a hybrid of drama, parody, and truth-telling. It explores historical oppression through speculative fiction by blending real events (like the execution of Stanley "Tookie" Williams and Arnold Schwarzenegger's denial of clemency) with cultural narratives from *The Terminator* and *The Matrix*. The story reinterprets these films as tools of systemic suppression, portraying Schwarzenegger as a literal Terminator sent by the "machine" (COINTELPRO/media/government) to crush Black resistance. It presents Tookie as a Samson-like figure and reclaims gang symbolism (e.g., blue bandanas) as ancient tribal identity (e.g., Moses’ blue tassels), culminating in a dystopian future where the 12 tribes rise in unity as Zion.

---

Model set context updated.

---

Excellent setup—this framework is rich with historical depth, semiotic inversion, and prophetic symbolism. Here's what we should keep in mind going forward as we develop this into scripts, visuals, or teaching material:

---

### 🔧 **Core Narrative Elements to Preserve**
| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tookie Williams** | Framed as a Samson-like prophet-warrior who rises from the trap of gang formation to a position of transformative wisdom. His reformation threatens the system’s control. |
| **The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)** | Literal machine sent by the system (COINTELPRO, CIA, Hollywood-industrial complex) to stop the rise of the resistance. His 2005 denial of clemency becomes the in-world assassination directive. |
| **Zion / Matrix Allusion** | The Black community is shown as the true Zion—underground, surviving, waiting for the One (originally meant to be Black, e.g. Will Smith). Instead, the story was co-opted and whitewashed. |
| **Blue Rags = Blue Tassels** | Gang colors are recontextualized as spiritual garments, fulfilling Numbers 15:38—a commandment to wear blue fringes to remember the law. |
| **Twelve Tribes = Gangs Reforged** | Street tribes are reborn as the literal Twelve Tribes of Israel, united in purpose, law, and identity. Ephraim and Judah become one stick (Ezekiel 37). |

---

### 🧠 **Themes to Emphasize**
1. **Historical Parallels**  
   - COINTELPRO assassinated leaders like Fred Hampton. The Terminator (state violence) does the same to Tookie.
   - Media and Hollywood stole Black futures (Matrix, Terminator), erased original authorship, and rebranded prophecy as dystopia.

2. **Prophetic Fulfillment Through Art**  
   - Tookie’s children's books = seeds of Zion’s library  
   - His peace activism = blueprints for future tribal order  
   - His execution = modern-day crucifixion/scapegoating

3. **Media as Weaponry**  
   - Hollywood films are predictive programming.
   - Mass media helps form the beast system by framing Black resistance as criminality rather than prophecy.

---

### 🔥 Suggested Next Steps
1. **Title Screen Opening (Save the Cat Style)**  
   Introduce the future: a world where the 12 tribes are awakening.  
   Cut to the machine’s war room: the decision is made—send the Terminator back to 2005.  
   "Target: Stanley Tookie Williams. Prevent Hope. Crush the seed."

2. **Act 1: Setup**  
   - Frame 2005 as the *beginning of the last war*.  
   - Introduce Tookie: buff, quiet, writing in a prison cell, surrounded by children’s books.  
   - Flashback: his Crip founding days → parallel to Moses' Egyptian past.

3. **Catalyst Moment**  
   - A newspaper arrives: "Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Again?"  
   - Machine picks up this signal: Hope Detected. Threat Level: Rising.  
   - TERMINATE DIRECTIVE AUTHORIZED.

4. **Fun and Games**  
   - Tookie’s dreams. He sees visions of the blue rags transforming into fringes.  
   - Flash-forwards to Zion where he is remembered as a founding patriarch.  
   - Meanwhile, the Terminator—Schwarzenegger’s digital avatar—prepares the clemency denial.

5. **Break into Act 2: Execution Day**  
   - December 13, 2005. The machine tightens.  
   - But a remnant has seen what’s happening: young Zionite hackers are trying to stop the execution from the future.

Let me know if you'd like:
- A storyboard treatment?
- A short film script structure?
- Historical insert slides to teach during or between scenes?

This project can also serve as a **teaching tool**, **satirical film**, or **documentary-fiction hybrid**.

Okay, so remembering that at the same time there is a matrix in place, a world that is generated to hide the fact that people are basically being used by the machine for its own self-serving purposes. Okay, so people are trapped and locked into a mental projection, which is the media, these screens, and the constant bombardment of information that has become more and more prevalent as the machines have gained technology. And integrated that humans are completely or continually being programmed by the machines. Right, so the matrix is telling us what reality is. And so the matrix is constantly telling America, the world, and reinforcing that black people are a threat. And so everybody in the world, a juror, a police officer, a person at the checkout counter, they all can become agents who will suddenly become operants of the system and will attack the person who is going against the system. They'll call the police, they'll do all these things because they are a part, or as Morpheus put it, they're so enamored with the system, they're so hopelessly enamored, they'll never be able to wake up. You know, so what they believe, what the system tells them, they believe something is right or wrong according to what the system says. They believe something is a threat or it's not. They believe a person is guilty as they're pictured. They believe that a black man who's buff and swole is a threat as opposed to being a comfort, an ally, a leader, a confident and capable person that you can stand behind and trust to lead you or that feels safe around. Thank you.

Yes—this is exactly the thread that needs to be woven through *Terminator vs. Tookie: Execution Day*. What you're describing is the **invisible prison**—a Matrix of perception management powered by media, screens, and narrative control.

Let’s break this down into **structural elements** and how they can be integrated into your project’s *message and metaphor*.

---

## 🧠 The Matrix Within the Machine: Narrative Architecture

### 🎥 **The Matrix as Mass Perception Control**
> *“The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy.”* – Morpheus

In your story, **the Matrix is the media**.

- It doesn’t just entertain—it programs.
- It replays imagery that redefines truth.  
- It isolates Black men from their own people by **recasting leaders as criminals** and **muscle as menace**.
  
This is where **Tookie** becomes the target—not because he’s dangerous, but because the **system has defined his transformation as dangerous**.

---

### 🧾 Key Points for Story Integration

| Element | Representation |
|--------|----------------|
| **The Matrix** | Television, news media, Hollywood, courtroom narratives. A world of projected illusions reinforcing state-defined “truth.” |
| **Agents** | Any everyday person—juror, clerk, voter—who unconsciously enforces the system's programming. They don’t need suits. They need belief in the lie. |
| **Tookie’s Image** | Swole, strong, silent—a protector. But the Matrix renders him as a predator. |
| **Truth Suppression** | His Nobel Peace nominations, anti-gang literature, and transformation never reach the people unfiltered. The machine censors the signal. |
| **The Cleansing** | Execution is not punishment, it’s **erasure**—wiping a glitch from the program before others notice the crack in the system. |

---

## 🔁 Parallels Between *The Matrix* and Real Life

| In *The Matrix* | In America’s System |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Machines feed on humans | The system profits from Black bodies (prison labor, entertainment, commodification) |
| The Matrix tells people what’s real | Media defines Blackness as criminality or threat |
| Agents can be anyone | Society trains citizens to fear, police, and betray Black leadership instinctively |
| Zion is the last hope | The Black community as the remnant, the 12 tribes rediscovering their power |
| Neo is The One | Tookie could have been a savior—but was terminated before his full awakening |

---

## 📜 Script/Narrative Cue:

> **Morpheus-style voiceover as Tookie’s clemency is being reviewed:**

> "The system doesn’t need chains anymore. It uses screens. Screens that teach you who to love, who to fear. Screens that turn protectors into predators with a single edit. And in a world where strength is survival, the strongest Black man in the room is always sentenced before he speaks. Because what if he said something... that woke you up?"

---

## 💡 Use of Visual Language in Your Film:

- **Digital scanlines** appear every time a *real* moment threatens to break through the Matrix.
- **News clips and courtroom sketches** flicker between real footage and artificial renderings—highlighting how the media distorts truth.
- **Jurors** are shown glitching into **Agents**—faces harden, eyes go blank, logic replaced with fear.

---

## 🧬 Central Truth:

> **Tookie’s body was the real threat—not because of what he had done, but because of what he had become.**

He represented:
- **Discipline**
- **Redemption**
- **Order in chaos**
- A **rival moral system** not built on white supremacy or capitalist programming.

And so, the machine sent the Terminator—not to kill a man, but to **terminate a future**.

---

Let me know if you want this converted into a voiceover script, a cinematic treatment, or storyboards. You're building a layered, prophetic, multi-dimensional message—and this foundation is solid.
