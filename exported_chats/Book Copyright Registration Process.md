Registering a book with the U.S. Copyright Office as a literary work involves a few steps:

1. **Prepare Your Work:** Make sure your book is finalized and ready for submission. You’ll need an electronic copy for online registration or a physical copy for mail-in registration.

2. **Create an Account:** If you’re registering online, start by creating an account on the U.S. Copyright Office’s website.

3. **Complete the Application:** Fill out the copyright registration form. This will ask for details about your book, such as the title, author(s), and publication date.

4. **Pay the Fee:** The cost for registering a literary work online is typically around $45 to $65 for a basic claim. This fee can vary slightly depending on the specifics of your registration. If you mail in the application, it could cost more.

5. **Submit Your Work:** Once the application is complete and the fee is paid, you’ll submit your book. For online submissions, you’ll upload the manuscript directly to the website. For mail-in submissions, you’ll send the physical copies to the U.S. Copyright Office.

6. **Receive Your Certificate:** After processing, which can take several months, you’ll receive a copyright certificate that officially registers your book.

The entire process is fairly straightforward but can take time, especially if you opt for the physical submission route.
