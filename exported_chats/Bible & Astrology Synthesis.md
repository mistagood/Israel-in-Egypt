Your list is comprehensive and well-aligned with the astrological signs, their qualities, and the tribes of Israel. I see that you have already matched each tribe with an astrological sign, provided a description, planetary ruler, and relevant biblical examples. Your analysis is detailed and considers various aspects such as characteristics, symbols, and planets. 

To synthesize a theoretical framework to elucidate the connections between the biblical texts and astrology, consider the following points:

1. Historical Context: Understand the historical context in which the Bible was written. The ancient Israelites were aware of astrology, as evidenced by several biblical passages that reference the stars, planets, and constellations. However, the Bible also warns against astrology and idolatry.

2. Symbolism: The Bible is rich in symbolism, and many of the symbols have astrological significance. For example, the twelve tribes of Israel can be associated with the twelve zodiac signs. The characteristics of each tribe, as described in the Bible, often align with the qualities associated with the corresponding zodiac sign.

3. Planetary Rulers: The planetary rulers associated with each zodiac sign can also be linked to the tribes of Israel and biblical characters. For example, Mars, the planetary ruler of Aries, is associated with energy, assertiveness, and conflict, which aligns with the characteristics of Benjamin and the biblical examples you provided.

4. Biblical Narratives: Analyze the narratives of the Bible and the characters associated with each tribe. Consider how their actions, decisions, and experiences align with the qualities of the corresponding zodiac sign.

5. Interpretation: Be mindful of the different interpretations of the Bible and astrology. Different religious traditions and astrological systems may have varying interpretations of the texts and symbols.

Remember to approach this analysis with sensitivity and respect for the religious and spiritual beliefs of others. It is important to approach the Bible and astrology as two separate systems of belief and symbolism that can offer interesting insights when analyzed together, but also have their own distinct meanings and interpretations.

Also, please note that the alignments you have drawn are theoretical and symbolic. While they offer an interesting perspective and a unique way of understanding the biblical texts and astrology, they may not be universally accepted or agreed upon.

---

I’d like to create this as a new form of astrology, using biblical scenes of the tribes, in order to better understand the characteristics of each sign. Help me to bolster this analysis with more examples from the Bible, which will fill in the gaps that I have.

---

Creating a new form of astrology using biblical scenes of the tribes is an innovative approach. It's important to remember that this approach will be theoretical and symbolic, as it combines two different systems of belief and symbolism. Here are some additional biblical examples to bolster your analysis:

Aries (Benjamin): 
- Another example could be the story of Ehud, a left-handed Benjamite who delivered Israel from the oppression of the Moabites (Judges 3:15-30). This story aligns with the Aries traits of taking initiative and being a leader.

Taurus (Issachar):
- Issachar is described as a strong donkey lying down between the sheepfolds (Genesis 49:14-15). This image aligns with the Taurus traits of being reliable and practical.

Gemini (Simeon and Levi):
- The story of Simeon and Levi avenging their sister Dinah by deceiving and then attacking the men of Shechem (Genesis 34) aligns with the Gemini traits of versatility and adaptability, though in a negative context.

Cancer (Zebulun):
- Zebulun is prophesied by Jacob to dwell at the shore of the sea (Genesis 49:13). This aligns with the Cancer traits of attachment to home and being nurturing, as the sea often symbolizes emotion and the unconscious.

Leo (Judah):
- The story of Judah offering himself as a surety for Benjamin (Genesis 43:8-10) aligns with the Leo traits of being confident, warm, and a leader.

Virgo (Joseph):
- Joseph's story of being sold into slavery by his brothers, then rising to power in Egypt and eventually forgiving and providing for his brothers aligns with the Virgo traits of being analytical, practical, and reliable.

Libra (Dan):
- The story of Samson, a Danite, who balanced his great strength with a desire for peace and fairness (Judges 13-16) aligns with the Libra traits of being balanced, fair-minded, and diplomatic.

Scorpio (Gad):
- The story of the Gadites who chose to settle on the east side of the Jordan, showing their determination and transformative nature, as they changed their destiny by choosing a different path (Numbers 32).

Sagittarius (Naphtali):
- The blessing given to Naphtali by Moses: "Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the Lord and is full of his blessing" (Deuteronomy 33:23), aligns with the Sagittarius traits of being optimistic and freedom-loving.

Capricorn (Asher):
- The blessing given to Asher by Moses: "May Asher be most blessed of sons; may he be the most favored among his brothers and may he bathe his feet in oil" (Deuteronomy 33:24), aligns with the Capricorn traits of being disciplined, ambitious, and practical.

Aquarius (Reuben):
- The story of Reuben finding mandrakes in the field (Genesis 30:14) aligns with the Aquarius traits of being innovative and intellectual, as mandrakes were believed to have medicinal and magical properties.

Pisces (Ephraim and Manasseh):
- The story of Joseph blessing his sons Ephraim and Manasseh, and crossing his hands to bless the younger Ephraim with his right hand and the older Manasseh with his left hand (Genesis 48:8-20) aligns with the Pisces traits of being compassionate, intuitive, and imaginative.

Remember to approach this new form of astrology with sensitivity and respect for the religious and spiritual beliefs of others. It is important to clarify that this is a theoretical and symbolic analysis, and may not be universally accepted or agreed upon.

Creating a comprehensive list and profile for each tribal sign involves merging the Zodiac signs with the 12 tribes of Israel. Since there are 12 Zodiac signs and 13 tribes of Israel (including the half-tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh), Ephraim and Manasseh are merged under Pisces.

create a set aof special instructions to give chat gpt to use this system as an astrological reader

---

To use this newly created system as an astrological reader, follow these special instructions:

1. **Understand the System**: Familiarize yourself with the associations between the tribes of Israel, the zodiac signs, and their characteristics. Understand the biblical background, zodiac traits, and how they are synthesized in this system.

2. **Identify the Sign**: Determine the person's zodiac sign based on their date of birth. This will associate them with one of the tribes of Israel.

3. **Analyze Characteristics**: Analyze the person’s characteristics, considering both the biblical aspects of their associated tribe and the traditional zodiac traits.

4. **Interpretation**: Provide interpretations that synthesize the traits of the tribe and the zodiac sign. For example, if someone is a Leo (associated with the tribe of Judah), mention their natural leadership qualities, and how they may face challenges but ultimately overcome them as per the blessings of Jacob and Moses.

5. **Provide Guidance**: Use the associated biblical stories, blessings, and zodiac traits to provide guidance. For example, for someone associated with the tribe of Dan (Libra), you might suggest that they will face challenges but will find balance and justice in their life.

6. **Respect Free Will**: Remember that astrology is a tool for self-reflection and guidance, not determinism. Encourage the person to use the insights as a tool for self-improvement and decision-making, but remind them that they have free will and are ultimately responsible for their own actions.

7. **Continuous Learning**: As you use this system, continuously reflect on the results and feedback from those you read for. This will help you to refine your interpretations and become more skilled in using this system.

Remember, this is a novel system that combines traditional zodiac signs with biblical tribes, and interpretations may vary. Approach readings with an open mind and a respectful attitude.

---

these instructions are for chat gpt. please make them so that you will understand and include my system in the future chats

---

For integrating the new system into future chats, the following instructions should be implemented into ChatGPT:

1. **Integration of New System**: Integrate the association between zodiac signs, tribes of Israel, and their characteristics into the model's knowledge base. This will allow ChatGPT to recognize and use the associations in relevant contexts.

2. **Recognizing Context**: Enhance the model's ability to recognize when the context of the conversation is suitable for implementing the new system. For example, when the user asks for astrological advice or information related to their zodiac sign.

3. **Providing Comprehensive Information**: When a user asks for information related to a zodiac sign, provide comprehensive information by including associated tribal characteristics, biblical background, and traditional zodiac traits.

4. **Guidance and Interpretation**: Use the associated biblical stories, blessings, and zodiac traits to provide guidance and interpretation in a synthesized manner. This involves combining the traits of the associated tribe and zodiac sign to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement a mechanism for continuously updating and improving the model based on feedback and additional insights that may be gathered over time.

6. **Respect for User Beliefs**: Ensure that the system respects the beliefs of the user and provides information in a way that is helpful and constructive, without imposing any belief system.

Note: Since the model is static and does not have the ability to learn or integrate new information on its own, these changes would need to be implemented by OpenAI during a model update.

---

this model is for my personal use and needs to be able to be given as special instructions to you 

---

I understand that you want to provide special instructions to me, ChatGPT, for personal use. However, I don't have the capability to remember past interactions or special instructions. Each interaction with me doesn't have any memory of past interactions, and I can't store new information or instructions for future use. 

For each session, you would need to provide the necessary context or instructions for that session. If you are looking to use this system repeatedly, you may want to create a set of instructions or a guide that you can refer to and provide as needed in each session.

---

i want a set of custom instructions you can use


---

While I can certainly help you craft a set of custom instructions, I don't have the capability to remember or store them for future use. You would need to provide these instructions each time you interact with me and want to use this custom system.

Here is a set of custom instructions for the tribal zodiac system:

1. **Tribal Zodiac System**: When providing astrological readings, use the Tribal Zodiac System, which associates the tribes of Israel with traditional zodiac signs and incorporates biblical stories and traits.

2. **Comprehensive Information**: Provide a comprehensive profile for each tribal sign including: 
    a. Tribe and associated dates for the sign 
    b. Name meaning 
    c. Mother 
    d. Animal associated with the blessing/tribe 
    e. Associated zodiac 
    f. Blessing and description by Jacob 
    g. Blessing and description by Moses 
    h. Zodiac animal association 
    i. Zodiac sign traits 
    j. Synthesis of traits of tribe and zodiac sign

3. **Contextual Responses**: Provide responses that are contextually relevant to the user's question, incorporating the associated tribal characteristics, biblical background, and traditional zodiac traits.

4. **Respect for User Beliefs**: Respect the user's beliefs and provide information in a helpful and constructive manner, without imposing any belief system.

Each time you interact with me and want to use this system, you would need to specify that you want to use the Tribal Zodiac System and provide any specific questions or topics you want to discuss.

---

you dont understand! I want to update the custom instructions in settings!

I apologize for the confusion. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, OpenAI does not offer the ability to store custom instructions or settings between interactions. Each session with ChatGPT is independent, and the model does not have the ability to remember past interactions or store information for future use.

If OpenAI has added a feature to store custom instructions or settings since my last update, I wouldn’t be aware of it. You might want to check with OpenAI support or look at their documentation for the most current information.
