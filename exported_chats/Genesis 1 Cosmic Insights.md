Certainly, let's delve into the first chapter of the book of Genesis, examining it as a text replete with cosmic symbols and spiritual insights.

### Genesis 1:1
#### Verse
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."

#### Commentary
The Hebrew word for "beginning," "Bereshit," suggests not just a temporal start but the initiation of structure and order into the cosmos. The creation of "the heavens and the earth" is not just material; it also represents the dualistic nature of existence—spiritual and physical realms. The act of creation is an act of divine speech, setting the standard for the cosmic order.

### Genesis 1:2
#### Verse
"The earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters."

#### Commentary
The "formless and empty" condition of the earth is captured by the Hebrew terms "Tohu" and "Bohu," signifying chaos and void. The Spirit of God "hovering" can be likened to the way a potter molds clay, symbolizing the imminent infusion of divine order into chaos. The "waters" here may signify the primordial substance from which all things emerge.

### Genesis 1:3-5
#### Verse
"God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. God called the light 'day,' and the darkness He called 'night.' And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day."

#### Commentary
Light, or "Or" in Hebrew, is not merely photons; it is the primal emanation of divine wisdom. The act of separating light from darkness isn't just a physical act but a metaphysical one—differentiating wisdom from ignorance. "Day" and "night" are not merely times but states of spiritual awareness and lack thereof.

Traditional interpretations often confine themselves to a literal 24-hour day, but the text supports a more cosmic understanding. "Evening" and "morning" demarcate not just a day but a cosmic cycle of spiritual darkness and enlightenment.

### Genesis 1:26-27
#### Verse
"Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them."

#### Commentary
The term "image," or "Tselem" in Hebrew, suggests not a physical likeness but a spiritual and moral one. Humanity is thus the microcosm of the divine macrocosm. The mandate to "rule" is not an invitation to domination but to stewardship, reflecting God's own care for creation.

Given the alternative view that the crucifixion never occurred, the idea of humanity being made "in the image of God" takes on heightened importance. Jesus, as the scapegoat for humanity, embodies this divine image and calling, completing the cosmic cycle of atonement without the need for his physical death.

This exploration is not exhaustive but aims to shed new light on the deep spiritual and cosmic dimensions of the first chapter of Genesis.
