Was Tupac ever known to use body doubles

---

There is no substantial evidence to suggest that Tupac Shakur used body doubles. While conspiracy theories about Tupac faking his death and using body doubles have circulated, they lack credible support and are generally considered speculative. Tupac's death was confirmed by multiple reliable sources, including law enforcement and medical personnel, and there is no verifiable proof to support the claim of him using body doubles.

That wasn't the question I asked, period. I asked if Tupac ever used body doubles, period, as an actor. It's likely that he used body doubles in the movies and had people who were very close to his likeness and who were trained to impersonate him.

---

Yes, as an actor, Tupac Shakur likely used body doubles for certain scenes, as is common in the film industry. Body doubles are often used for various reasons, including stunts, ensuring continuity, or covering for actors during difficult scenes. For example, in the film "Above the Rim," doubles might have been used for specific stunts or shots. However, these doubles were typically employed for practical purposes in film production rather than for impersonation or deception.
