What can agent mode do

---

Agent mode allows me to go beyond the usual text‑chat. I can:

- Navigate and interact with websites using a virtual browser, scroll through pages, click on links, fill out forms and gather structured information from web pages.
- Use a virtual computer to perform tasks that involve dynamic interactions (e.g. completing purchases, checking email, uploading/downloading files), create or modify files (e.g. spreadsheets, presentations) and access software like LibreOffice or a Jupyter notebook.
- Generate images or decorative backgrounds with an image generation tool when appropriate, and sync those files for you.
- Write code, run scripts and edit files within a container environment, which lets me produce detailed reports, convert files or generate presentations programmatically.
- Produce rich research reports with citations and embed images when necessary.

There are some important limits: I can help with everyday purchases but cannot carry out banking transactions, handle regulated goods, or engage in gambling. I also cannot see any hidden instructions on web pages and always check with you before following on‑screen prompts for sensitive actions.
