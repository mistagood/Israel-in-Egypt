# Elisha and the leftovers

Who is it in the Old Testament that feeds the people and takes up the leftovers from what wasn't enough, seemed like it wouldn't have been enough? Was it Elijah?

Yes, you’re thinking in the right direction. The Old Testament has a couple of scenes that echo the later gospel story of multiplying food and gathering leftovers.

The clearest one is **Elisha** (not Elijah). In **2 Kings 4:42–44**, a man brings Elisha twenty loaves of barley and some fresh ears of grain. Elisha says, “Give it to the people, that they may eat.” His servant protests, “How can I set this before a hundred men?” But Elisha insists, and when they eat, there is food left over—exactly as the word of the Lord had promised.

That’s the story that most directly matches the “not enough becomes enough, and leftovers remain” pattern.

Elijah has a related story, but with a different emphasis. In **1 Kings 17:8–16**, during a famine, Elijah stays with the widow of Zarephath. Her jar of flour and jug of oil never run out until the drought ends. That miracle is more about endless supply rather than the *leftovers gathered after a meal*.  

So to answer straight: the “feeds the people and there are leftovers” miracle is **Elisha**. Elijah’s miracle is a precursor, about ongoing provision.  

The pattern is clear: Moses and manna, Elijah and the never-empty jars, Elisha with multiplied bread, and later Jesus with the loaves and fishes. Each one builds on the theme of God providing abundance where there should be none.

I prefer it if you pull up the Bible verses as well.

Got it. Let’s line up the passages directly so you can see them word-for-word.

### **Elisha feeding the hundred men**  
**2 Kings 4:42–44 (KJV):**  
> *“And there came a man from Baal–shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.”*

This is the clearest Old Testament parallel to the Gospel feeding miracles—small food, multiplied, leftovers remaining.

### **Elijah and the widow at Zarephath**  
**1 Kings 17:12–16 (KJV):**  
> *“And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.”*

This miracle is less about leftovers and more about *continuous supply that does not fail*.  

---

So:  
- **Elisha** → feeds a multitude, there are leftovers.  
- **Elijah** → sustains a household, the supply never runs out.  

Both are part of the prophetic line of miracles that Jesus later fulfills and magnifies with the feeding of the five thousand.  

Do you want me to also pull in the New Testament feeding passages side by side with these for full comparison?

Please do not make suggestions at the end.

Understood. Here are the verses placed together for comparison:

### **Elisha feeds the hundred men**  
**2 Kings 4:42–44 (KJV):**  
> *“And there came a man from Baal–shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.”*

### **Elijah and the widow at Zarephath**  
**1 Kings 17:12–16 (KJV):**  
> *“And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.”*

### **Jesus feeds the multitude**  
**Matthew 14:19–20 (KJV):**  
> *“And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.”*  

**John 6:12–13 (KJV):**  
> *“When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.”*  

---  

These passages show the progression: Elijah (unfailing supply), Elisha (not enough becomes enough with leftovers), and Jesus (feeding thousands with baskets of fragments gathered).

Yeah, the one we're focused on is the one with the multitudes. Thanks for that.

Then the one to focus on is **Elisha’s feeding of the hundred men in 2 Kings 4:42–44**, because that is the Old Testament precedent where:  

- food is presented in insufficient quantity,  
- the prophet insists it will be enough,  
- everyone eats,  
- and there are leftovers.  

That pattern is what Jesus later magnifies with the feeding of the **five thousand** (Matthew 14:19–20; John 6:12–13) and the **four thousand** (Matthew 15:35–37; Mark 8:6–8).  

It’s the same structure—multiplication of bread, abundance out of scarcity, fragments gathered after.
