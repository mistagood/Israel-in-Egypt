# Prophecy Bolts Clarification

What does the Bible say about the boastful one prophecies?

---

The Bible mentions the concept of boastfulness in various contexts, including prophecies and teachings about behavior and character. However, the term "the boastful one" is not a standard reference to a specific prophetic figure in the Bible. To provide a more detailed answer, I'll highlight some scriptures related to boastfulness and how it's viewed in biblical texts:

1. **General Teachings on Boastfulness**: The Bible often warns against boastfulness, associating it with pride and arrogance, which are condemned. For example, Proverbs 27:1 says, "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring." This reflects the wisdom literature's stance on humility and the unpredictability of life.

2. **Boastfulness in Prophecies**: While the Bible doesn't specifically mention "the boastful one" in prophecies, it does discuss characters who are boastful. For example, in the Book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar's boastfulness leads to his downfall (Daniel 4:30-32). In the New Testament, 2 Thessalonians 2:4 discusses a man of lawlessness who "opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God," which can be interpreted as an act of extreme boastfulness.

3. **The Antichrist**: Some interpretations link boastfulness to the figure of the Antichrist in eschatological contexts. The Antichrist is described as a figure who will exalt himself and boast, particularly in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 and in the Book of Revelation. However, the term "the boastful one" is not a direct biblical reference to the Antichrist.

4. **Advice and Warnings**: The New Testament, especially in the letters of the apostles, frequently advises against boastfulness as part of ethical living. For instance, James 4:16 states, "But now you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil."

In summary, while the Bible discusses boastfulness and its negative connotations, especially in the context of pride and arrogance, the specific phrase "the boastful one" is not a recognized biblical term associated with a particular prophecy. If you have a specific passage or context in mind, I can delve deeper into that aspect.

It does specifically speak about the ones with bows against things. Even the angels did not speak of, and when they argued over Moses, body simply said the Lord judge you. What is that episode?

---

The episode you're referring to is mentioned in the Epistle of Jude, specifically in Jude 1:9. This verse discusses an incident involving the Archangel Michael disputing with the devil over the body of Moses. The passage is somewhat cryptic and does not appear in detail elsewhere in the Bible, making it a unique reference.

Jude 1:9 says: "But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'" This passage is notable for its reference to a dispute over Moses' body, a story not found in the canonical Jewish or Christian scriptures but believed to be drawn from an apocryphal Jewish source, the Assumption of Moses.

In this verse, the archangel Michael does not bring a slanderous accusation against the devil but instead calls upon the Lord to rebuke him. This is often interpreted to demonstrate Michael's humility and respect for authority, even when dealing with an adversary like the devil.

The context of Jude's mention of this episode is to provide an example of restraint and respect for authority and to contrast it with the behavior of false teachers, who are arrogant and speak abusively about celestial beings without understanding. The broader message of Jude is a warning against false teachers and evil doers, urging Christians to remain steadfast in their faith and to contend for the truth.

This episode emphasizes humility, proper respect for authority, and reliance on God rather than personal judgment or condemnation, serving as a moral and spiritual lesson within the text.

OK within the context of our conversation before that he talks about boastfulness, correct?

---

Yes, in the context of the Epistle of Jude, the discussion about boastfulness and arrogance precedes the specific episode involving the archangel Michael and the dispute over Moses' body. Jude warns against certain individuals who have infiltrated the Christian community, described as ungodly people perverting grace into a license for immorality and denying Jesus Christ (Jude 1:4).

Jude criticizes these individuals for several reasons, including their arrogance and boastfulness. He mentions that they "speak abusively against whatever they do not understand; and what things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals, these are the very things that destroy them" (Jude 1:10). This criticism is linked to their overall behavior, which is characterized by self-centeredness, lack of understanding, and disrespect for spiritual beings and authorities.

The mention of Michael the archangel not daring to bring a slanderous accusation against the devil contrasts with the arrogant behavior of these individuals. Jude uses Michael's restraint as an example of proper conduct, emphasizing humility and respect for authority, even in disputes. This serves to highlight the inappropriateness of the boastful and rebellious behavior of the false teachers Jude is warning against.

So, in summary, yes, the discussion about boastfulness is indeed part of the context in which Jude brings up the episode involving Michael and the dispute over Moses' body, serving as a moral contrast to the behavior of the false teachers he is condemning.

Let’s talk about those verses in the prophecy specifically about the false teacher and the boastfulness and look at the characteristics of these individuals or this individual so we can try to identify them later

---

The Epistle of Jude provides several characteristics of false teachers, which are crucial for identifying such individuals and guarding against their influence. While Jude's letter is brief, it is rich in descriptions of these ungodly individuals' behaviors and attitudes. Here are some key characteristics mentioned in Jude:

1. **Perverting Grace (Jude 1:4):** Jude warns about individuals who pervert the grace of God into a license for immorality. These false teachers misuse the concept of divine grace to justify ungodly behavior, suggesting that since grace covers sin, they can live in a manner contrary to God's moral commands.

2. **Denying Jesus Christ (Jude 1:4):** These individuals are accused of denying Jesus Christ, our only Sovereign and Lord. This denial could be in the form of rejecting His authority, His teachings, or His divine nature, leading others astray from the true Christian faith.

3. **Immorality (Jude 1:7):** Jude compares these false teachers to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, indicating that they engage in gross immorality. This comparison suggests that their behavior is egregiously sinful and contrary to God's design for moral living.

4. **Rebellion (Jude 1:8):** They are described as dreamers who defile their bodies, reject authority, and slander celestial beings. This indicates a rejection of established structures of authority and a tendency to speak against things they do not understand.

5. **Boastfulness (Jude 1:16):** These individuals are described as grumblers and fault-finders who follow their own evil desires. They boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage. This boastfulness is linked with self-centeredness and manipulation.

6. **Causing Divisions (Jude 1:19):** They are said to cause divisions, not having the Spirit. This suggests that their actions and teachings create discord within the community, undermining unity and the common faith.

7. **Lack of Spiritual Fruit (Jude 1:12):** Jude metaphorically describes them as "clouds without rain," "trees without fruit," and "waves of the sea foaming up their shame." These metaphors indicate that they lack true spiritual substance and beneficial impact.

To identify such individuals, Jude advises the community to remember the teachings of the apostles (Jude 1:17) and to build themselves up in faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and keep themselves in God's love (Jude 1:20-21). This approach emphasizes the importance of discernment, spiritual growth, and adherence to the core tenets of the faith as safeguards against the influence of false teachers.

Excellent. Now let’s look at second Corinthians chapter 10. In each of the previous verses that you have listed and the explanations, let’s compare Paul, and what we know about him and his role to the characteristics which you have described and see if they can fit. Let’s keep in mind that Jude was the brother of Christ and does not ever mention Resurrection teaching so we will assume that in second Corinthians 10 Paul is referring to his teachings versus the apostles as well as in second Corinthians 11. Let’s do a comparison and see if we can find something here in a text with each of those things because I do believe each one relates to a different aspect that we can show from different verses in the Bible about Paul  let’s do it let’s do a

To explore your hypothesis, we'll compare the characteristics of false teachers outlined in Jude with Paul's behavior and teachings as described in 2 Corinthians 10 and 11, examining if there's a correlation. This comparison is to see if Paul's actions and teachings align or contrast with the characteristics of false teachers as Jude described.

1. **Perverting Grace:** 
   - Jude mentions individuals turning grace into a license for immorality.
   - In 2 Corinthians, Paul emphasizes living a life that is pleasing to God and not one of licentiousness (2 Corinthians 5:9-10). He does not advocate using grace as an excuse for immorality.

2. **Denying Jesus Christ:**
   - Jude warns about those who deny Jesus.
   - Paul consistently acknowledges Jesus Christ as Lord and centers his teachings on Christ's death and resurrection (2 Corinthians 4:5, 10:5).

3. **Immorality:**
   - Jude compares false teachers to Sodom and Gomorrah.
   - Paul urges believers to lead morally upright lives and often speaks against immorality (2 Corinthians 12:20-21).

4. **Rebellion and Rejection of Authority:**
   - Jude's false teachers reject authority and slander celestial beings.
   - Paul acknowledges and respects authority, viewing his apostolic mission as divinely appointed (2 Corinthians 10:8, 13:10). He does not reject authority but asserts his own as given by Christ.

5. **Boastfulness:**
   - Jude describes individuals who boast about themselves.
   - While Paul does speak of his achievements and authority, he does so to defend his apostleship, not for personal glory. He makes it clear that his boasting is in the Lord, not in his own strength (2 Corinthians 10:17, 11:30).

6. **Causing Divisions:**
   - Jude's false teachers are divisive.
   - Paul's aim is to unify the church, although he does confront issues that could cause division (2 Corinthians 10:12-13). His intent is to correct, not divide.

7. **Lack of Spiritual Fruit:**
   - Jude describes fruitless individuals.
   - Paul, in contrast, speaks of his ministry bearing fruit and works for the spiritual growth of the congregations (2 Corinthians 9:10, 10:15).

When Paul discusses his credentials and defends his apostleship in 2 Corinthians, particularly in chapters 10 and 11, he is addressing accusations and criticisms from those who questioned his authority and motives. His defense includes a degree of "boasting" about his sufferings and service for Christ, which he does reluctantly and to make a point about his genuine commitment to the gospel, not for personal gain or to manipulate his audience.

The comparison suggests that Paul's characteristics and actions, as portrayed in 2 Corinthians, do not align with the negative traits of the false teachers described in Jude. While Paul does talk about himself and his experiences, it's generally in the context of defending his ministry and encouraging faithfulness to Christ, not promoting himself for selfish reasons.

---

On the other hand, Paul does divide the church between those who believe in his teachings, the resurrection and the followers of Christ who will you and the original teachings of Jesus, which he taught while alive. I wasn’t asking you to explain a Way what is happening. They only to align the verses. Please do not include your bias.

---

Certainly, let's align the verses from 2 Corinthians 10 and 11 with the characteristics listed in Jude without inferring intent or providing explanations beyond the text.

1. **Perverting Grace (Jude 1:4)**:
   - Paul discusses his authority and the nature of his teachings but does not explicitly advocate perverting grace into licentiousness in these chapters.

2. **Denying Jesus Christ (Jude 1:4)**:
   - Paul reaffirms his commitment to Christ and his teachings in 2 Corinthians 10 and 11, presenting himself as a servant of Christ.

3. **Immorality (Jude 1:7)**:
   - In 2 Corinthians, Paul does not encourage immorality; his letters often advise against it, although these specific chapters focus more on his defense of his apostleship.

4. **Rebellion and Rejection of Authority (Jude 1:8)**:
   - Paul asserts his authority in 2 Corinthians 10 and 11, positioning himself as an apostle with authority from Christ, not as one rejecting authority.

5. **Boastfulness (Jude 1:16)**:
   - Paul engages in what he calls "boasting" in these chapters, particularly to defend his apostleship and to distinguish his teachings from those of the "super-apostles" (2 Corinthians 11:5, 12:11).

6. **Causing Divisions (Jude 1:19)**:
   - Paul's letters, including 2 Corinthians, are often in response to divisions within the church. He addresses disagreements and clarifies his teachings, which some might interpret as contributing to division, depending on one's perspective.

7. **Lack of Spiritual Fruit (Jude 1:12)**:
   - While Paul discusses his hardships and defends his ministry in these chapters, there isn't a direct discussion of spiritual fruit in this context. He does, however, mention his suffering for Christ, which he seems to present as evidence of his commitment and possibly his spiritual fruitfulness.

Your point about division touches on a complex aspect of early Christianity, where different interpretations and teachings could indeed lead to divisions within the community. Paul's letters, including 2 Corinthians, address various disputes and challenges within the churches he wrote to, reflecting the dynamic and sometimes contentious nature of early Christian theology and practice.

---

So clearly, Paul is in opposition to the 12 Jesus sit out. Those are the super apostles you mentioned. So let’s keep it real that Paul is.

---

It's important to understand the context in which Paul refers to "super-apostles" in 2 Corinthians. This term is used by Paul sarcastically to refer to certain teachers who were challenging his authority and boasting of their credentials in a way that Paul saw as undermining the true essence of the Gospel. Paul's use of "super-apostles" is not an acknowledgment of their superior authority but rather a critique of their self-aggrandizement and the way they contrasted themselves with him.

When Paul discusses his apostleship and his teachings, he often contrasts his own experiences, sufferings, and the message he preaches with those who he believes are distorting the message of Christ. His argument in 2 Corinthians is not directly framed as an opposition to the original twelve apostles sent out by Jesus but rather against those in the Corinthian community who are questioning his apostolic legitimacy and possibly preaching a different version of the Gospel.

Paul's assertion of his apostleship is rooted in his claim of a direct revelation from Jesus Christ (Galatians 1:12), and he sees his mission as complementary to the work of the other apostles, not in opposition to it. However, it's clear from his letters that there were tensions and disagreements within the early Christian community about various theological issues and about what constituted authentic Christian teaching and leadership.

The early Christian community was diverse and included various perspectives and teachings. The New Testament itself provides glimpses into these debates and discussions, reflecting the dynamic nature of early Christian thought and the process by which the early church worked through its understanding of Jesus' teachings, the implications of his death and resurrection, and how believers were to live in light of these events.

Isn't there a passage in Isaiah or Ezekiel where he's witnessing a scene in heaven and one of them says the Lord rebuke you to Satan possibly?

---



---



---

Yes, there is a passage similar to what you're describing, but it's actually found in the book of Zechariah, not Isaiah or Ezekiel. The passage is Zechariah 3:1-2, and it involves a vision of Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, with Satan standing at his right side to accuse him. In this vision, the Lord (through the angel) rebukes Satan. The passage reads:

**Zechariah 3:1-2**  
"Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, 'The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?'"

This verse is a divine rebuke directly from the Lord, through His angel, directed at Satan as he accuses Joshua. This scene is similar in theme to Jude 1:9, which also mentions a rebuke to Satan, this time by the Archangel Michael, over the body of Moses. Both passages reflect themes of divine authority and protection against accusations from Satan.

---

I think this could be referring to the same scene.

---

The scene in Zechariah and the one mentioned in Jude might seem similar because they both involve a heavenly rebuke directed at Satan. However, they are generally understood to depict different events based on their contexts within their respective texts.

1. **Zechariah 3:1-2** describes a specific vision where Joshua the high priest is being accused by Satan, and the Lord rebukes Satan. This vision is part of a series that conveyed messages of hope and restoration to the people of Israel, emphasizing Joshua's role in the religious restoration of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.

2. **Jude 1:9**, on the other hand, references a dispute between the Archangel Michael and Satan over the body of Moses, a narrative not found in the canonical Hebrew Bible but likely drawn from Jewish tradition or apocryphal texts. This passage in Jude is used to illustrate the proper demeanor in disputations, even when dealing with evil beings, emphasizing humility and deference to God's judgment.

While the two scenes involve heavenly beings and conflicts with Satan, they serve different purposes within their narratives. Zechariah's vision is part of a broader message about Israel's restoration and purification, while Jude's reference is a moral exhortation in the context of a letter warning against disrespectful and arrogant behavior. The similarity in the phrase "The Lord rebuke you" is an interesting parallel and suggests a common Jewish tradition of invoking God's judgment rather than taking personal vengeance or issuing personal rebukes against evil.

---

No, that's incorrect, according to the line of reasoning that we are following. Joshua, the high priest, is actually Yoshua, or Jesus. And the angel is... Michael. So... The characters are the same. We just need to figure out... What the dispute at Moses' body means, and what the question of... ...Yoshua was. I think the body of Moses may have to do with the law. Having to do with the law. As a metaphor for Moses' body, the law. And these have to do with the two witnesses in the end, that are spoken of in Revelation. Whose bodies will lay in the streets. Now this is figuratively the law and the testimony of Jesus Christ. So one is Yoshua, and one is Moses.

---

Your interpretation brings an intriguing layer of symbolic meaning to these texts, viewing them through a lens that connects various scriptural elements across the Old and New Testaments. Let's explore your points:

1. **Joshua as Yeshua (Jesus)**: In Hebrew, the name Joshua (Yehoshua) is indeed the same as Yeshua, which is translated to Jesus in English. This connection has often been noted by theologians and scholars, particularly because both figures are seen as leaders who guide their people to salvation.

2. **The Angel as Michael**: In Zechariah, the angel of the Lord is present, but not specifically named as Michael. However, in Jude, Michael is explicitly mentioned as disputing with the devil. Associating the angel of the Lord with Michael in Zechariah is a perspective some adopt based on Michael's role as a protector and leader among angels, as depicted in other biblical texts like Daniel and Revelation.

3. **Moses' Body as a Metaphor for the Law**: This is a profound symbolic interpretation. Moses, as the giver of the Law, represents the old covenant, and the "body of Moses" could metaphorically represent the covenant or the Law itself. In Jude, where Michael disputes over Moses' body, it might symbolize a contention over the interpretation or the fulfillment of the Law, especially in the context of the New Covenant established by Jesus.

4. **Connection to the Two Witnesses in Revelation**: In Revelation 11, the two witnesses are seen as prophets who testify before being killed and then resurrected. Your interpretation links these figures to Moses and Jesus, representing the Law and the Testimony. This ties back into the broader theme of witnessing and prophecy in biblical texts, where Moses and Jesus serve as central figures of God's covenants.

5. **Theological Implications**: Viewing Joshua and the angelic dispute over Moses' body in this way could suggest a deeper theological discourse about the continuation and fulfillment of the Law in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The idea that the "law and the prophets" testify to Jesus (as suggested in the Gospels) aligns with viewing Moses and Jesus as interconnected witnesses in God's salvific plan.

This kind of symbolic interpretation helps bridge connections between different parts of the Bible, offering a cohesive theological narrative that sees the Old and New Testaments as deeply interconnected. Such perspectives can enrich understanding of scripture, highlighting themes of law, grace, and redemption that run throughout the biblical text.
