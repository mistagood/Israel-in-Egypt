# Two Trees Allegory



---

Adam and Eve and the Forbidden Fruit, or Two Trees, is an allegory.

Adam is Israel who God gave a commandment. 
Eve is what is derived  from Adam (Israel), Christianity. 



Deuteronomy 30:15 is the key.  


Moses lays out the key to the allegory as the two trees. He explains that the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil are relative to the two choices. One is life and good and the other choice is death and evil. 
So life is to good as death is to evil. 
So when we have a tree of life, tree is good. And when we have a second tree, it's a tree of good and evil. So it's a tree of both life and death. And so the second tree is a doctrine/knowledge that includes death and life. And so the first commandment was to not eat from that tree, but to eat from the tree of life. This is synonymous with the law or the commandments that God gave to Israel through Moses. So in this allegory, the preachers, specifically Paul and his letters that teach salvation through resurrection represent a doctrine that says life comes through the death of Jesus Christ. Therefore, this represents the tree of good and evil because it has both life and death. And so this is also an outgrowth of Judaism. Christianity came from the rib, if you will, of Israel. And so Paul represents the one who had vast knowledge, who was able to trick the people who had less knowledge, who would be the new Christians who didn't know the old commandment and the law that God had given to Israel. Or as it was in the beginning or in the allegory, God told Adam, don't eat from the tree. And then he was created. So she wouldn't have had firsthand knowledge of the law that God gave Adam, just as the Christians who Paul spoke to often didn't have knowledge of the firsthand law that was given to Moses. And so the choice then is clear that there is one law that leads to life. And the Bible says over and over again that if you keep the commandments, then you'll have life. Jesus says this as well. If you want to have life, you can keep the commandments. So this is the tree of life. Now, the other doctrine which says that you won't die even though you've sinned and have not kept the commandment that God said is the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Because God says that if you keep his law, then you have life. And if you don't, then you have death. But Paul taught that you could have life without the law and that you wouldn't you wouldn't die just as the serpent has said, but instead that you become transformed and that you would judge angels. This is the same argument that the serpent used when he told Eve that her eyes would be open and she would become like God, knowing good and evil, for who can judge angels except God.

**Uncovering allegorical themes**

Mapping out an allegory: Adam represents Israel's divine command, Eve symbolizes Christianity's roots in Judaism, and the two trees allude to Deuteronomy 30:15's choices of life or death.

**Navigating allegorical insights**

I'm exploring the allegory of the first tree as Torah, bringing life, and the second tree as Paul's doctrine, incorporating knowledge and resurrection, with the serpent representing divergent teachings.

**Telling a divine story**

I'm crafting a script to explore the allegory of Adam, Eve, and the two trees, focusing on the transformative doctrines of the Torah and Paul's teachings. This unpacks a profound theological narrative.

In the beginning, a hidden political intrigue takes shape in the story of Adam and Eve. Adam is Israel, entrusted with a direct command from the Most High, just as the nation of Israel received the Law from Moses. Eve emerges from Adam’s side, symbolizing the new entity derived from Israel—Christianity—formed later and lacking the firsthand revelation of that original command. The ancient text of Deuteronomy 30:15 reveals the two divergent paths set before Adam and Eve: one leading to life and good, the other to death and evil. These are the two trees. The first tree promises life when one follows the commandments, while the second is a mixture of good and evil that offers knowledge but also leads to destruction if the command is ignored.

This second tree, wrapped in the promise of both life and death, becomes the doctrine of a resurrection-based salvation championed by Paul. He speaks to those unaware of the initial commandment—Eve’s heirs, if you will—telling them that they will not die despite breaking the original Law. It echoes the serpent’s words in Eden: “You will not surely die.” From the viewpoint of political struggle, this new teaching wields power by liberating followers from the rigorous rule of the old Law, granting them a sense of spiritual ascent—becoming like God, judging even angels—while overlooking the condemnation that disobedience was said to bring. Just as Eve did not receive the command from the Creator firsthand, many early Christians who heard Paul’s teachings lacked a full understanding of the Law entrusted to Israel, placing them in a vulnerable position where knowledge can be spun into enticing promises of life in spite of sin.

The original command, given to Adam and personified in Israel, stresses that obedience to God’s laws yields life. Over and over, the scriptures say, “Keep the commandments and live.” Even the Messiah affirms that if you want eternal life, keep the commandments. This is the true tree of life in the allegory. Opposite it stands the tree that melds good and evil into one bitter fruit—an enticing mix of salvation through death, of life derived from crucifixion rather than obedience. In that way, what began with Adam as the direct command not to eat from this fatal knowledge became a forbidden shortcut to power, and Eve, representing those newly grafted onto the faith, is persuaded to see the possibility of immortality without the discipline of the Law. Paul’s intricate arguments and promises of judging angels mirror the serpent’s whisper of divine knowledge. Through this lens, the ancient story of the Garden is more than a simple tale; it is an epic battle for spiritual and political authority, pitting the original commandment of life and obedience against a seductive offer of power gained through a mixture of both good and evil.

yeah so let's step back because I want to underscore this whole thing that Moses was in writing this giving us the direct story and even more by referencing back to this he was making a direct analogy and telling us what the tree means so when he says he equates good with life so when you see the tree of life that means good and he equates evil with death so good is to evil I mean good is to life as evil is to death so when he says I put two roads the two roads there or two paths these are the same as the two trees that God presented

---

It sounds like you want a detailed exposition on how Moses directly uses the two trees as an analogy for the two paths—life and death—particularly in Deuteronomy 30:15. Do you want this framed as a deep-dive theological analysis, an exposé-style narrative, or another specific format? Also, do you want any historical or linguistic context added to strengthen the argument?

---



---

Yes, this is definitely a theological analysis and linguistic and historical context with a hermeneutic lens. It's about the complete allegory.

---

I'll conduct a theological analysis of the complete allegory of the two trees, examining Moses' direct analogy in Deuteronomy 30:15 and how it connects to the Genesis narrative. This will include linguistic and historical context, as well as a hermeneutic interpretation that underscores how the trees represent two distinct paths—life and death. I'll explore how these concepts are reinforced throughout scripture, particularly in contrast to later theological developments, such as Paul’s teachings. 

I'll provide the analysis once it's ready.

# The Two Trees and the Two Paths: A Theological Analysis

## Introduction  
In the opening chapters of Genesis, two special trees stand as powerful symbols: the **Tree of Life** and the **Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil**. These trees form an allegory about the fundamental choice facing humanity – the choice between life in fellowship with God and the death that comes from rebellion. Centuries later, Moses evokes this same paradigm when he tells Israel, **“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil”** (Deuteronomy 30:15). In doing so, Moses is essentially drawing a direct parallel to Eden, framing Israel’s covenant decision as a choice between two paths, like the two trees in the garden【49†L155-L163】【10†L185-L193】. This analysis will explore the allegory of the two trees through linguistic, historical, and hermeneutic lenses – showing how the Tree of Life represents the pure **good** of obedience and life with God, whereas the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil represents a dangerous mixture of **good and evil**, life and death. We will trace this two-path theme from Genesis through Moses’ teachings in Deuteronomy, and onward into later theology – especially the apostle Paul’s teaching on salvation and resurrection – to understand how this allegory shapes biblical interpretation of obedience, divine law, and spiritual authority.

## Linguistic Insights: “Life,” “Good,” and “Evil” in Hebrew  
Understanding key Hebrew terms in these passages enriches the allegory. In Genesis 2–3, the names of the two trees carry symbolic meaning: 

- **“Tree of Life”** – in Hebrew *‘ēts haḥayyīm* (עֵץ הַחַיִּים). The word **ḥayyīm** means “life” (a plural form often used for the abstract idea of life). This tree’s name implies it imparts life – indeed, Genesis describes its fruit as granting immortality【50†L236-L242】. After the Fall, God prevents access to it so that humans do not “eat, and live forever” (Gen. 3:22).  
- **“Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil”** – in Hebrew *‘ēts hadda‘at ṭōv wā-rā‘* (עֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע). Here **ṭōv** means “good” (morally good, pleasant, or beneficial) and **rā‘** means “evil” or “bad” (that which is harmful or wicked)【50†L236-L242】. The phrase **“good and evil” (ṭov va-ra‘)** is a Hebrew merism – a figure of speech pairing opposites to signify *totality*. Thus, “knowledge of good and evil” can mean **knowledge of everything**【21†L199-L207】 or the full range of moral knowledge. It implies the ability to discern or determine all that is good and bad. Notably, in Hebrew idiom this can also connote **moral autonomy** or maturity. For example, little children “do not yet know good and evil,” suggesting that knowing good and evil is a capacity of adults (see Deut. 1:39, Isa. 7:16). In Genesis, this tree’s name signals a knowledge that properly belongs to God alone – the Creator’s prerogative to define good and evil.  

In Deuteronomy 30:15, Moses pointedly uses the same Hebrew terms: **ḥayyīm** (life), **ṭōv** (good), **māvet** (death), and **rā‘** (evil)【19†L23-L32】【19†L33-L40】. He tells Israel he has set before them “הַֽחַיִּ֖ים וְ…הַטּוֹב… וְ…הַמָּ֖וֶת וְ…הָרָֽע” – “life and the good, and death and the evil.” The pairing of **“life and good”** versus **“death and evil”** mirrors the dichotomy of Eden’s two trees. Just as **tov** and **ra‘** (“good and evil”) were combined in the forbidden tree, Moses combines **life** with **good**, and **death** with **evil**, underscoring the moral polarity of the choice. Linguistically, Moses’ words deliberately echo the Genesis language: the people can choose the “good” that leads to **life**, or the “evil” that leads to **death**【49†L155-L163】. This parallel vocabulary links the narratives and signals that Israel now faces an Eden-like decision.

It’s also worth noting the Hebrew word for **“knowledge”**, *da‘at* (דַּעַת), in the tree’s name. This isn’t mere superficial information, but deep experiential knowledge. The context of Genesis suggests it’s the knowledge one would gain by *taking* the authority to decide good and evil for oneself (as the serpent enticed, “you will be like God, knowing good and evil”). Thus, the very terms used in Scripture set up a contrast between **life under God’s rule** and **the mixed knowledge gained through defiance**.

## The Two Trees in Genesis: Life vs. a Mixture of Good and Evil  
In the Garden of Eden narrative (Genesis 2–3), the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil represent two divergent sources of spiritual sustenance. God freely offers the Tree of Life to the first humans – it symbolizes **divine life, blessing, and all that is **tov**** (good) for them. By eating its fruit, they would live forever, enjoying unbroken fellowship with God. The only tree withheld is the tree that would give them the **“knowledge of good and evil”**, accompanied by a grave warning: *“in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die”* (Gen. 2:17). This establishes the two trees as an allegory of **obedience vs. disobedience**, **trust vs. autonomy**. 

**The Tree of Life** stands for **unmixed good** – the fullness of life as God intended. Nothing harmful is associated with this tree; it is pure blessing. Early Jewish and Christian interpreters noted that God never forbade Adam from the Tree of Life; it was apparently available to eat【7†L158-L166】【7†L149-L157】. Only sin barred humans from it. In fact, some later writings equated the Tree of Life with **Wisdom** or with God’s **Torah (Law)**, because these were seen as life-giving gifts from God【50†L268-L275】【50†L279-L283】. Proverbs 3:18 poetically says of Wisdom, “She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,” linking life to embracing God’s wisdom【50†L279-L283】. In ancient Israelite thought, **life** was found in adhering to God’s word – *“for the commandment is your life”* (cf. Deut. 32:47). Thus, the Tree of Life can be understood as representing **divine instruction and communion that leads to life**. 

**The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil**, by contrast, represents a *mixed* reality. Its fruit is not portrayed as pure poison – in fact, Eve observes it is “good (tov) for food” and attractive (Gen. 3:6). It holds the appeal of **good** (the promise of wisdom) but tragically also carries **evil** (the consequence of death). As one commentator describes, *“The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Bad… looked like it could nourish and give life, but within was the seed of death. Its fruit led to ‘in dying you will die.’”*【50†L236-L242】. In other words, it combined the **appearance of life** with a fatal outcome. By eating it, Adam and Eve did gain a kind of knowledge – an awareness of morality and their own nakedness – but they simultaneously experienced spiritual death and eventually physical death. The mixture of **tov** and **ra‘** in the tree’s very name signals that what it offers is not purely life-giving. It yields a *knowledge of good* **and** *evil* – moral insight tainted by transgression and shame.  

Theologically, this tree can be seen as the choice to *seize moral autonomy*, grasping at the authority to define good and evil on one’s own terms rather than receiving wisdom from God. Some scholars suggest that “the knowledge of good and evil” in this context means **the wisdom of a judge – the power to administer reward and punishment** – essentially, taking on a God-like role of moral authority【21†L217-L222】. In reaching for this forbidden knowledge, the first humans attempted to usurp divine prerogative. The immediate result was alienation from God (they hide in fear) and the ultimate result was death – exactly as God warned. Thus, the Tree of Knowledge can be interpreted as representing **the path of disobedience**, where even something that has *good* aspects (the fruit was “desirable to make one wise”) becomes ruinous because it is taken against God’s command. It is a blend of enlightenment and downfall – a source of both insight and mortality. In effect, it offered a **mixture of life and death**: a taste of wisdom intertwined with the sting of sin and death. 

## “Choose Life”: Moses’ Analogy in Deuteronomy 30:15–20  
Fast-forward to the time of Moses. In Deuteronomy 30, Moses addresses the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land and renew the covenant with God. He distills their decision to its essence: **a choice between two paths** – *“life and good”* versus *“death and evil”* (Deut. 30:15). Moses implores them to *“choose life, that you and your offspring may live”* (30:19). This passionate plea is a **direct analogy** to the Eden scenario. Moses is, in effect, placing Israel in the position of Adam and Eve, confronted with a consequential decision. Just as the two trees stood before humanity in Eden, Moses sets before Israel the dual options of covenant faithfulness or unfaithfulness【49†L155-L163】. The parallels are striking:

- **Life and Good**: If Israel loves and obeys God – keeping His commandments and holding fast to Him – they will enjoy life, prosperity, and blessing in the land (Deut. 30:16, 19-20). This is akin to *freely eating of the Tree of Life*, receiving God’s provision and thriving. Moses stresses that God’s commands are **not too hard or distant** (30:11-14); God’s word is near, in their mouth and heart, accessible to guide them. Obedience will lead to **long life and blessing**, reminiscent of the life Adam and Eve would have continued to experience in Eden by heeding God’s word. In fact, Moses says **God *is* Israel’s life** (Deut. 30:20), highlighting that true life comes from relationship with Him.  
- **Death and Evil**: If Israel’s heart turns away and they disobey – serving other gods or breaking the covenant – the result will be disaster, curse, and perishing (30:17-18). This path parallels the choice to eat from the forbidden tree, which brought death. Just as Adam and Eve were exiled from the Garden, Moses warns that rebellion will lead to Israel’s exile from the land and the curses of the covenant (cf. Deut. 28:15-68). To *“choose death and evil”* is to repeat Adam’s folly. 

Moses’ intent here is *thoroughly theological and pedagogical*. He is impressing upon the people the gravity of their decision in terms they would understand – evoking the primordial example of obedience vs. disobedience. By using the Eden-like language of **life vs. death, good vs. evil**, Moses shows that the stakes of covenant loyalty are as high as life and death itself. This was not mere rhetoric; in the ancient Near Eastern context of covenants, **blessings and curses** were commonly set forth, but Moses frames them in a uniquely biblical way by alluding to creation. Essentially, he is saying: *“Just as our first parents faced a life-or-death obedience test, so do we today as God’s covenant people.”* The **historical context** underscores this even more – Deuteronomy is structured like an ancient treaty, listing blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. Israel’s worldview already connected following God’s law with life and blessing (see Deut. 4:1, 8:1) and turning from it with curse and death. Thus, Moses is crystallizing a core principle of Israelite faith: **“I have set before you life and death… Now choose life”** (30:19). 

Early interpreters noticed Moses’ deliberate echo of Genesis. A Jewish midrash imagines God saying, *“I set before you two paths… and said to you: ‘You shall choose life’”*, indicating that God, through Moses, was pointing the people back to the two ways exemplified in Eden (Devarim Rabbah 4:2-3). Likewise, modern commentators observe that *“Will you choose life or choose death?”* is the very question posed by the two trees in Genesis, **“similar to what Moshe (Moses) posed in Deut. 30:19”**【49†L155-L163】. Moses’ exhortation aligns perfectly with the Edenic lesson: **life comes from listening to God’s voice, and death comes from turning away**【9†L215-L223】【9†L231-L239】. In both cases, God doesn’t force the choice; He lays it out and urges the right decision. Moses, like a new Adam figure leading a new humanity (Israel), stands at the boundary of a “promised land” parallel to Eden, and urges Israel not to repeat Adam’s choice of the wrong tree.

## Ancient Covenant Perspective: Law as Life, Sin as Death  
To fully appreciate Moses’ words, we should grasp the **historical and theological context** of ancient Israel regarding **law, covenant, and divine instruction**. Unlike the false notion that the Old Testament law was about mere rule-keeping, Israel understood God’s Torah as a path to **life and blessing**. The Book of Deuteronomy repeatedly equates following God’s commands with **living fully:** *“Keep His statutes… that it may go well with you and that you may prolong your days on the earth”* (Deut. 4:40). Obedience was not just about duty; it was the source of prosperity, health, and divine favor – *“life and good”* in every sense. Conversely, disobedience to the covenant brought curses, calamity, and premature death (Deut. 28:15ff), i.e. *“death and evil.”* This covenantal outlook is exactly what Moses summarizes in Deut. 30:19. 

In ancient Near Eastern treaties between kings and vassals, documents would list blessings for loyalty and curses for violation. Deuteronomy mirrors this format, but Moses couches it in Israel’s unique theological narrative, harking back to creation. Ancient Israelites knew the story of Adam’s fall (either through Moses’ own Torah or oral tradition) and would recognize the pattern: God sets a choice and urges obedience. Thus, historically, **the Eden story functioned as a foundational lesson** – a paradigm that disobedience to God’s command brings death. Moses intentionally uses that shared understanding to reinforce the covenant: breaking faith with Yahweh would be a *“fall”* for Israel. Indeed, later prophets would compare Israel’s rebellion to Adam’s sin (Hosea 6:7). 

Moreover, in Jewish thought, the **Law (Torah)** was often likened to a life-giving tree. As noted, Proverbs 3:18 calls Wisdom (understood as God’s Torah or Word) a *“Tree of Life”*【50†L279-L283】. Some commentators even saw the cherubim guarding Eden’s Tree of Life (Gen. 3:24) as a motif repeated with the cherubim over the Ark of the Covenant (which held the tablets of the Law)【50†L268-L275】. In other words, **God’s Word was seen as the true source of life, analogous to Eden’s Tree of Life**. This is why Moses can say, *“Not by bread alone, but by every word from God does man live”* (Deut. 8:3) and *“the word is very near you… that you may do it”* (Deut. 30:14). Ancient Israel did not view law-keeping as a way to earn salvation by works, but as **the way to “choose life” – by clinging to God’s revelation**. They understood that the **Author of life** had set forth the way of life in the covenant. Thus, historically and theologically, **“life” was synonymous with covenant blessing**, and **“death” with covenant curse**. Moses’ analogy of the two paths tapped into this worldview, reminding Israel that just as Adam’s *one act* of disobedience led to death, so their collective obedience or disobedience would mean national life or death (blessing or curse). 

## The Two Paths Throughout Scripture  
The Eden narrative and Moses’ Deuteronomic choice are not isolated; they form a template that recurs throughout Scripture as the **“Two Ways”** motif. Over and over, God presents humanity (or Israel, or individual believers) with a binary choice: the way of life versus the way of death. Some examples and extensions of this theme include:

- **Wisdom Literature:** Psalm 1 opens the Psalter by contrasting the way of the righteous (who delight in God’s law) to the way of the wicked. The righteous man is likened to a fruitful tree, while the wicked will perish. Similarly, Proverbs frequently personifies Wisdom as a life-giving path in contrast to the path of folly leading to death (Prov. 14:12: *“There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death”*【50†L232-L240】). This is essentially the message of the two trees retold in everyday life choices. The righteous follow God’s instruction (Tree of Life), the foolish choose their own way (Tree of Knowledge leading to death).  
- **Prophets:** The prophets often set before the people a choice to repent and live or persist in sin and die. Ezekiel 18, for example, insists that the soul who sins shall die, but if a wicked man turns from his sin, *“he shall surely live; he shall not die”* (Ezek. 18:21). Jeremiah 21:8 directly echoes Moses: *“Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.”* The prophetic message is basically an Eden replay – return to God and live, or rebel and perish.  
- **Jesus’ Teaching:** Jesus also frames discipleship in terms of two paths. In the Sermon on the Mount, he speaks of the **narrow gate** that leads to life and the **broad road** that leads to destruction (Matthew 7:13-14). He warns that false prophets are like bad trees bearing evil fruit, whereas true disciples are like good trees bearing good fruit【50†L254-L262】. These images deliberately recall the Garden: the “bad tree” that produces deadly fruit versus the “good tree” of life. Jesus, like Moses, calls people to **choose the path of life**, which he identifies with following him and obeying God. He even tells a wealthy man, *“If you would enter life, keep the commandments”* (Matt. 19:17), again linking obedience with life. Ultimately, Jesus himself is presented as *the* way, truth, and life (John 14:6) – the one through whom we access eternal life, effectively restoring what was lost in Eden.  
- **Early Christian Writings:** The early church manual called the **Didache** (1st century) begins, *“There are two ways: one of life and one of death, and there is a great difference between the two.”* This shows how deeply the two-path framework had imprinted itself on Christian teaching. Believers were instructed that following Jesus meant walking in the way of life (characterized by love, righteousness, etc.), in contrast to the way of death (sin, idolatry, etc.). This is essentially Moses’ Deuteronomy sermon adapted for Christians.  
- **Revelation:** The Bible dramatically bookends its narrative with the two trees. In Genesis, humanity loses access to the Tree of Life by choosing sin. In Revelation 22, **the Tree of Life reappears** in the New Jerusalem, freely available to the redeemed, while **evil is banished**. Notably, there is no “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil” in the new creation – only the Tree of Life, bearing fruit for eternal health (Rev. 22:2, 14). This signifies that in the end, God’s original offer of **unmixed life** is fully restored to those who **overcame by choosing God**. The imagery in Revelation intentionally reverses the Fall: *“to the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the paradise of God”* (Rev. 2:7). Thus, the two paths motif comes full circle. As one commentary puts it, *“In the beginning (Genesis 1–3), there were the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Bad, but in the new heavens and earth (Revelation 21–22), those in the New Jerusalem will only have access to the Tree of Life.”*【49†L185-L193】. The way of life ultimately triumphs and the way of death is abolished – a powerful biblical conclusion to the two-path drama.

In all these instances, **Scripture consistently frames human existence as a moral and spiritual choice**. The Eden allegory extends through Moses and the prophets, into the teaching of Jesus and the apostles, all the way to eschatology. It highlights a core biblical truth: **God has set before us life and death, urging us to choose life by loving and obeying Him**【49†L155-L163】. The ongoing relevance of this allegory is seen in how it shapes the Bible’s calls to decision and covenant faithfulness at every turn.

## Paul’s Theology: Adam, Christ, and the Resolution of the Two Paths  
When we come to the apostle Paul, we find a deep reflection on the themes of life, death, law, and salvation – which he often frames by looking back to Adam and then to Christ. Paul’s teachings provide a theological resolution to the problem introduced by the two trees. He acknowledges that ever since Eden, humanity has been on the path of death through Adam’s sin, but that path is reversed through Jesus Christ.

**Adam and Christ – Death and Life:** In Romans 5:12–21, Paul famously compares Adam (the head of fallen humanity) and Jesus (the head of redeemed humanity). He doesn’t explicitly mention the trees, but he describes their effects. Adam’s disobedience – eating the forbidden fruit – brought sin and death into the world, and this death “spread to all men because all sinned” (Rom. 5:12). In contrast, Christ’s perfect obedience and his sacrificial death bring righteousness and life. Paul summarizes: **“If you are in Adam, you are under the reign of death, but if you are in Christ, you will reign in life, because Christ’s gift is greater than Adam’s sin.”**【52†L1-L3】【52†L13-L16】. In other words, the two paths set before humanity (life vs. death) correspond to being aligned with either Adam or Christ. Adam chose the way of the Tree of Knowledge – grasping at wisdom apart from God – and humanity reaped *death*. Christ chose the way of *obedience unto death on a different “tree”* (the cross), and through that act God’s *life* is made available to all. Paul exults that **“just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord”** (Rom. 5:21). This is the ultimate “choose life” – God’s grace enables us to choose life in Christ, escaping the death inherited from Adam.

Importantly, Paul recognizes that the **Law (Torah)** – while holy and good – could not by itself rescue humanity from the path of death. In fact, because of human sinfulness, the commandments ended up exposing sin and leading to death. He writes, *“The commandment, which was intended to bring life, actually brought death”* because sin hijacked it (Rom. 7:10-11)【54†L373-L381】. This is a profound insight: much like the Tree of Knowledge gave Adam and Eve something good (moral awareness) but also brought death, the Law of Moses (good and intended for life) brought death when violated. It’s not that the Law was flawed – *“the law is holy and good”* (Rom. 7:12) – but humans, in Adam’s footsteps, are prone to rebel. Thus, Paul concludes that the law on its own could not break the cycle of sin and death; it could diagnose the knowledge of good and evil, but it couldn’t cure the evil. This candid assessment aligns with the allegory’s implication that **knowing good and evil (moral law) does not avail for life if we are disconnected from God’s life-giving power**. We need a return to the **Tree of Life**, so to speak – a source of **renewal and immortality** beyond our own efforts.

That source is Jesus Christ. Paul’s doctrine of **salvation through the resurrection** of Christ directly connects here. He teaches that just as death came through Adam, **resurrection from the dead comes through Christ** (1 Cor. 15:21-22). Jesus is the *“last Adam”* who restores what the first Adam lost. By rising from the grave, Jesus conquered the death that entered via the forbidden tree. In doing so, he reopened humanity’s access to eternal life – reminiscent of regaining the Tree of Life (indeed, Revelation portrays the saved as eating from the Tree of Life again). Paul explains that those who belong to Christ will be made alive in the resurrection, receiving **immortal, imperishable bodies** (1 Cor. 15:52-54). This is essentially a return to Eden’s promise of unending life, but now secured through Christ’s victory over sin. 

Furthermore, Paul sees Christ’s cross as the pivotal act of obedience that contrasts with Adam’s disobedience. *“For as by one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous”* (Rom. 5:19). On the cross (often poetically called a “tree” in early Christianity, cf. Acts 5:30, 1 Peter 2:24), Jesus took the curse of our disobedience (Gal. 3:13) so that we might receive the blessing of Abraham – the promise of the Spirit and life. In a beautiful irony, what was an instrument of death (the cross) becomes for us **the Tree of Life**. As one author put it, *“The cross of Jesus Christ… fulfills the story of the two unique trees in the Garden. The cross is the new Tree of Life from which God feeds his people and shares his eternal life with them.”*【45†L251-L259】. Those who “eat” of this tree – by believing in Christ and partaking in his sacrifice (symbolized in the Lord’s Supper) – receive eternal life. At the same time, the cross also represents the ultimate **knowledge of good and evil**: it judges sin and reveals God’s righteousness. Christ, by his perfect obedience and suffering, exercised the *true* authority to judge evil and bring forth good (salvation). Thus, in Christ, the divided paths of the two trees are brought together – through the **Tree of Calvary**, God brings forth *ultimate good (life)* out of *ultimate evil (the crucifixion)*, and offers humanity a fresh choice: **trust in this Savior and live forever**.

In summary, Paul’s theology reinforces and deepens the two-tree allegory: **Adam’s path (disobedience leading to death) versus Christ’s path (obedience leading to righteousness and life)**【52†L13-L16】. Where Moses set life and death before Israel in terms of covenant law, Paul sets life and death before all people in terms of being “in Christ” or remaining “in Adam.” Yet Paul insists it’s fundamentally the *same* choice. As one commentator notes, *“There never was, since the fall of man, more than one way to heaven… Moses meant that same way of acceptance, which Paul more plainly described; and Paul’s words mean the same obedience, on which Moses more fully treated.”*【23†L39-L47】. In both Old and New Testaments, the way of life is to **love and obey God** (now revealed in Christ), and the way of death is to turn away. Paul’s contribution is to show that through the Holy Spirit and the resurrection power of Christ, believers are finally equipped to *truly* choose life and escape the curse of death that Adam’s sin brought. **“Thanks be to God, who delivers me… through Jesus Christ our Lord!”** (Rom. 7:25).

## Hermeneutical Implications: Obedience, Law, and Authority  
Reading the Bible through the lens of the two trees allegory has significant implications for interpretation and theology. It provides a unifying framework for understanding God’s dealings with humanity, especially regarding **obedience, divine law, and spiritual authority**:

- **Obedience as the Path to Life:** From Eden to Revelation, the consistent message is that **listening to God’s voice leads to life**【9†L215-L223】【9†L231-L239】. The allegory teaches that obedience is not about arbitrary rules, but about trusting the Author of Life. Adam and Eve’s failure illustrates that distrusting God’s command opens the door to death. Moses, the prophets, Jesus, and Paul all echo this: true life (both abundant life now and eternal life to come) is found in **yielding to God’s will**. Hermeneutically, this means when we read biblical commands or moral teachings, we should see them not as burdensome obligations but as part of that life-giving way of God. The Tree of Life imagery invites readers to delight in God’s commands (cf. Ps. 19:7-11, Prov. 3:18) as something that **nourishes and preserves life**, rather than viewing God’s law as something opposed to life. This corrects two extremes: lawlessness (choosing what seems good in our own eyes, like taking the forbidden fruit) and legalism (mistakenly treating law-keeping as a means to manipulate life from God, rather than a response of trust). The Eden story shows that at heart, obedience is about relationship – Adam and Eve’s choice was a relational breach. So, biblical interpretation should always consider the relational aspect of commands: they are opportunities to “choose God” and thus choose life, not just moral checkboxes. 

- **Divine Law and Human Limitations:** The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil allegory highlights that **moral knowledge apart from God can be destructive**. God’s law defines good and evil for us, because we are not capable of determining these rightly on our own. When Adam and Eve grasped for that knowledge, they effectively said, “We’ll decide what is right or wrong for ourselves.” This usurpation led to ruin. Thus, one implication is that *humility before divine law* is essential. The human tendency is to repeat Adam’s choice – to declare our independence and define morality to our liking. The Bible consistently counters this by asserting God’s sovereign right to determine good and evil. As readers and interpreters of Scripture, we’re warned not to invert the Eden order – we must let God’s word judge our thoughts, rather than judging God’s word by our thoughts. The allegory shapes a hermeneutic of **submission**: just as Moses said the word is very near us and we must do it, so we approach Scripture ready to obey, trusting that therein is life. At the same time, Paul’s analysis of the law (noted above) reminds us that the law on stone tablets couldn’t by itself produce life because of sin. We need God’s Spirit to internalize the law (Romans 8:2-4). The two trees thus also caution that **mere knowledge of good** (head knowledge of God’s commands) is insufficient – we need a new heart. The blossoming of later revelation (New Covenant promise in Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36) is essentially God making a way to put the “Tree of Life” inside us – writing the law on our hearts and giving us the Spirit, so that obedience becomes a fruit of a transformed heart rather than a grasping of our will. Biblical interpreters see this as the progression from the letter that kills to the Spirit that gives life (2 Cor. 3:6). In practical terms, whenever we interpret a command or doctrine, the two trees framework nudges us to ask: *Does this lead me toward the life of God (like eating from the Tree of Life), and how might my sinful tendencies twist this into death (like misusing the knowledge of good and evil)?* It’s a call to interpret Scripture with reliance on the Spirit, not just on our own intellect. 

- **Spiritual Authority and the Human Condition:** The allegory also opens up discussion on **who has the right to rule**. The Tree of Knowledge can be viewed as the symbol of humans seizing authority to decide truth for themselves. The tragic outcome reveals that **true authority belongs to God**. In biblical theology, one can trace how Satan’s temptation was essentially an incitement to rebellion against God’s kingship. By contrast, the Tree of Life symbolizes *remaining under God’s benevolent rule*. The hermeneutic implication is that all of Scripture is telling a story about God’s authority and mankind’s attempted autonomy. Themes of kingdom, covenant, and lordship throughout the Bible tie back to this. For example, when Israel demands a king “like the nations,” or when they worship idols, or when in Romans 1 Paul says humans “exchanged the truth of God for a lie,” it’s the same story: rejecting God’s authority to define reality, and the result is chaos and death. Understanding the two trees helps us see the unity in these narratives. It also informs Christian living: Jesus calls us to *deny ourselves*, take up the cross, and follow him – essentially undoing Adam’s assertion of self-rule by submitting fully to God. By yielding to Christ’s lordship (authority), we return to the path of life. 

- **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Allegory:** Early Christian interpreters often allegorized the two trees in light of Christ. We’ve already seen how the cross is paralleled to the Tree of Life. One could say **Jesus is the fruit of the Tree of Life** that we must partake in to be saved (cf. John 6:54, *“Whoever feeds on me…has eternal life”*). In him “was life, and that life was the light of men” (John 1:4). The hermeneutic payoff is that all Scripture, from Genesis onward, was preparing for Christ, who gives back eternal life. The contrast between Adam and Christ becomes a key to interpreting the Bible’s storyline (as Paul exemplified in Romans 5). Thus, the two trees allegory shapes a Christian reading of the Old Testament: we see in Eden the problem for which Christ is the solution. Everything in the law and prophets that reinforces the life-vs-death choice ultimately drives us to realize our need for the Savior who is *“the resurrection and the life”* (John 11:25). For instance, when Moses says “choose life,” a Christian interpreter can observe that Israel (like Adam) often failed to do so, pointing to the necessity of Christ’s intervention. This doesn’t nullify the Old Testament message; it completes it. In Christ, the way of life is opened permanently. The Book of Revelation explicitly links salvation to regaining paradise: those who wash their robes in the Lamb’s blood “have the right to the tree of life” (Rev. 22:14). 

In sum, the allegory of the two trees is a hermeneutical key that **illuminates the unity of Scripture’s message**. It shows that from beginning to end, the Bible is about the **choice God gives humanity** and His desire for us to freely choose Him. It casts commands and covenants not as legalistic tests, but as loving opportunities to choose life. It exposes the lie of Satan (that disobeying God leads to a better life) and affirms the truth that **God alone is the source of life and wisdom**. And it magnifies Jesus Christ as the one who, by perfectly choosing obedience (the good) and bearing our evil, empowers us to return to the Garden. As the BibleProject scholars aptly state, the Eden story “illuminates the human condition while also explaining the choice before each of us”【9†L231-L239】. Every generation and every individual stands metaphorically before the two trees. Will we trust in God’s Word (eat from the Tree of Life) or seize autonomy (eat from the mixed tree of good and evil)? The call of Scripture, from Moses to Jesus to the apostles, is unanimous: **“choose life… by loving the Lord your God, obeying His voice, and holding fast to Him, for He *is* your life”** (Deut. 30:19-20). 

## Conclusion  
The allegory of the two trees in Eden, when examined in depth, proves to be a foundational theological motif that resonates through the entire Bible. Linguistically, the Hebrew text itself links Genesis and Deuteronomy, teaching that **“life” is bound up with “good,” and “death” with “evil.”** Historically, Moses leveraged this allegory to press upon Israel the seriousness of covenant choices, essentially placing them in Adam’s shoes. Throughout Scripture, this two-path framework – life vs. death, blessing vs. curse, wisdom vs. folly – recurs as a continual invitation and warning from God. Ultimately, Christian theology sees Jesus as the one who traversed the way of the cross to bring us back to the way of life, conquering the death that Adam unleashed. Paul’s emphasis on resurrection life in Christ highlights that the gift Adam forfeited (eternal life with God) is restored by the “last Adam,” who enables us to *“reign in life”*【52†L13-L16】. Reading the Bible with the two trees in mind helps us to understand that **obedience to God has always been a matter of life and death** – a theme as relevant now as ever. It challenges us to acknowledge God’s authority in defining good and evil, to trust His commandments as life-giving, and to find our ultimate life in the One who hung on a tree to defeat death for us. In the end, the story of the two trees is the story of two ways – and God’s persistent desire that we **choose the way of life**, thereby enjoying fellowship with Him now and forever. As the Scripture closes with the vision of the Tree of Life accessible to all God’s people, we are reminded that the choice to cling to God (the choice set before Adam, before Israel, and before each of us) leads to nothing less than **eternal life and the fullness of good**【49†L185-L193】.

Now, I don't think you understood at all. I said that Paul represents the serpent who teaches another path, and that path that he teaches is resurrection salvation. If you follow the logic of what I'm saying, and the allegory, you realize that there's no need for a crucifixion and resurrection. There's only the need to follow the law in order to live. Jesus said this himself. The resurrection doctrine is the tree of knowledge of good and evil that Moses was prophesying about. It is the false doctrine. It mixes life with death. Everything you said in there about Christ and resurrection was all wrong. I don't know where you got that out of what I said. The whole point is that Moses taught one way, and Paul brought another way. He's the serpent who misguided the Christian church into eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is the death of Christ on the cross and his resurrection. That is the knowledge of good and evil. It is the beginning of thinking that you do not need the law and that you can decide for yourself what is right and wrong. 
You see, Paul is the false prophet that was spoken of by Moses, by Ezekiel, in Ezekiel 13. Moses in Deuteronomy 13. And by Jesus and Matthew. You see, Jacob said that Benjamin would be a ravenous wolf. Jesus said that the false prophet is a ravenous wolf. Now Paul identifies himself as a Benjamite. And not just a Benjamite, but a certain Benjamite. Now, we understand that Paul made himself into a prophet or an apostle, although he never met Jesus. He was in opposition with the teachings of Jesus and Moses and the disciples. 
Now in the book of Judges, the Benjamites are responsible for the most grievous sin possibly that Israel has committed in the Bible. And one of the tribes was nearly wiped out. This was the tribe of Benjamin. This was only one of their rebellions. Saul next rebelled against God and pursued David after being disobedient to God's word. Next, a Benjamite caused a rebellion against David. And all of the ten tribes rebelled against David. Later, we see Paul come along and become a stumbling block to Israel. He is called that man of lawlessness who teaches everyone against the law and against the temple. He is recognized by Israel as an enemy and a false prophet.
Now if Jesus said you will know the false prophets by their fruit, we look at the tribe of Benjamin and see their fruit and offspring is Paul. And if they were a bad tree, how could they bear good fruit? Jesus identifies this false prophet as a ravenous wolf, as a hapax legomenon in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. We know that these words are related to each other because only Jesus and Jacob used them. 
So again, I say Paul led Christianity away from the law, like the serpent led Eve in the garden. Now, if everything was created by God's word, and the Bible is literally the word of God, then we know that within that book is the creation. So when we look at the Garden of Eden, a story, we see that the words that make up the Bible create a word garden. And in that garden, there are two trees, meaning in the Bible, there are two teachings. One leads to life, and one leads to death. The only two teachings in the Bible come from Moses and from Paul.

I see now that you are drawing a direct parallel between Paul and the serpent, arguing that his doctrine of resurrection is the false teaching—the tree of knowledge of good and evil—that leads people away from the law. You’re also emphasizing the tribal lineage of Benjamin as a marker of rebellion throughout Israel’s history, culminating in Paul as the ‘man of lawlessness’ and the false prophet prophesied by Moses, Ezekiel, and Jesus.

To ensure I provide the most thorough theological and hermeneutical analysis aligned with your framework, could you clarify:
- Would you like a focused exposé that explicitly contrasts Paul’s doctrine with Moses’ and Jesus’ teachings, highlighting how Paul diverged from the law?
- Should I include historical and linguistic analysis of Deuteronomy 13, Ezekiel 13, Matthew’s false prophet warnings, and Jacob’s prophecy about Benjamin?
- Would you like a structured breakdown of how Paul's doctrine allegedly functions as the ‘fruit of the bad tree’ in contrast to the true path of the law?
- Should I present this as a theological argument, a narrative exposé, or another format?

---



---

Yes, it's the same theological argument, human hermeneutic lens, historic and linguistic context, and yes to all three of the bullet points above that, contrasting Moses and Paul's teachings, including historical and linguistic analysis that show Paul as the false prophet, because all of these connect back to actions that Paul took, and we can frame it as the fruit of the bad tree, or yes, absolutely, and yeah, it shows how his teachings diverge from Moses and Jesus himself as well, and the law.

---

I'll conduct a deep theological analysis of Paul’s teachings in contrast to Moses’ and Jesus’ instructions, highlighting how Paul's doctrine diverges from the law and aligns with the allegory of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This will include historical and linguistic analysis of Deuteronomy 13, Ezekiel 13, Matthew’s false prophet warnings, and Jacob’s prophecy about Benjamin. 

Additionally, I will analyze the historical actions of Paul, how they align with the role of the false prophet, and frame his teachings as the 'fruit of the bad tree.' The analysis will use a hermeneutic approach to show how Paul’s doctrine functions as a stumbling block that led Christianity away from adherence to the law. 

I'll provide the full analysis once it's ready.

# Paul vs. Moses and Jesus: Unmasking the “Other Gospel” Tree

**Introduction:** In Christian history the apostle Paul is often revered, yet a close theological analysis reveals stark contrasts between Paul’s teachings and the foundations laid by Moses and Jesus. Using the biblical allegory of two trees – the **Tree of Life** (obedience to God’s law) vs. the **Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil** (a tempting mixture of truth and falsehood) – we will examine prophecy and scripture to argue that Paul represents the **“bad tree”** of Jesus’ warning, a **false prophet** leading people away from God’s Torah (Law). This exposé compares Paul’s doctrines to Moses’ Law and Jesus’ teachings, analyzes key prophetic warnings (Deuteronomy 13, Ezekiel 13, Matthew 7), and investigates Paul’s identity as a “ravenous wolf” from Benjamin. The evidence – historical, linguistic, and scriptural – builds a persuasive case that Paul’s gospel of law-free grace and resurrection, though containing some truth, fundamentally contradicts the original covenant and marks him as the very deceiver against whom the Bible warns.

## 1. Paul’s Teachings vs. Moses and Jesus: Divergence from the Law

**Paul *vs.* Moses – Law and Obedience:** Moses’ instructions in the Torah emphasize **absolute fidelity to God’s commandments** as the path to life and covenant blessing. For example, Moses declares to Israel: *“I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments… **that thou mayest live**”*【48†L342-L350】. The Sinai covenant was clear that **obedience to God’s law** was non-negotiable for God’s people. Moses even warned that if a prophet or miracle-worker urged the people to forsake the Law, it was a test from God – such a prophet was false and was to be rejected and executed【10†L347-L354】. This Deuteronomy 13 test explicitly says that even if one performs signs and wonders, if he *“urges rebellion against the Lord your God… to turn you from the way the Lord your God has commanded you to walk,”* he is a false prophet【10†L347-L354】. In short, **teaching disobedience** to the Torah equals **apostasy** in Moses’ eyes.

Paul’s message diverges dramatically on this point. Paul taught that **faith in Christ replaced strict Torah observance** as the basis for righteousness. He famously wrote, *“we have been **released from the law**, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code”*【28†L231-L238】. Repeatedly, Paul told believers (especially Gentiles) that keeping Mosaic law – things like circumcision, dietary laws, feast days, and even the Ten Commandments’ Sabbath – was **no longer required** for salvation. *“After faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster [the law],”* Paul argues【27†L122-L130】. He went so far as to say, *“Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes”* and *“if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing”* (Romans 10:4, Galatians 2:21). In Paul’s view, **the law was a temporary guardian** leading to Christ, but now that Christ had come, the Law’s authority was obviated【27†L118-L126】【27†L128-L136】. This *“law free”* gospel flatly contradicts Moses’ command *“you shall not add or subtract”* from God’s commandments and his instruction that obedience was an **eternal covenant** (e.g. Deut. 4:2, 29:29).

Indeed, Paul was **accused by contemporaries of teaching against Moses.** The Book of Acts records that even in the first century, Jewish believers were alarmed at Paul’s doctrine. James and the Jerusalem elders said to Paul: *“they have been informed of you that **you teach all the Jews** who live among the Gentiles **to forsake Moses**, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to observe the customs”*【50†L31-L39】. Likewise, when Paul came to Jerusalem, some cried out: *“This is the man who **teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law** and **this place** [the Temple]”*【54†L36-L44】. Such reports show that Paul’s reputation was one who undermined the Torah – exactly what Moses warned a false teacher would do. According to the Deuteronomy 13 test, if someone, even with signs and wonders, entices believers *“not to keep His commands”* and *“turns you from the way”* God commanded, that person is a deceiver【10†L347-L354】. By encouraging Jews and Gentiles *“not to circumcise their children or live according to [Mosaic] customs”*【50†L31-L39】, Paul fails Moses’ criterion. **No wonder early Messianic believers were concerned** – Paul’s gospel appeared to annul the everlasting covenant of law that God gave through Moses.

**Paul *vs.* Jesus – Commandments and Law-Keeping:** Not only do Paul’s teachings conflict with Moses, they also contradict **Jesus’ own words** about the Law. Far from abolishing the Torah, Jesus upheld it: *“Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets… until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot will pass from the Law”*【28†L226-L234】. Jesus insisted that *“whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments **and teaches others to do so** shall be called least in the kingdom”*, whereas those who keep and teach the commandments will be great【23†L85-L93】【23†L94-L102】. He warned people to **observe Moses’ teachings** (e.g. Matt. 23:1–3) and told seekers that *“if you would enter life, **keep the commandments**”* (Matt. 19:17). In summary, Jesus never taught his followers to abandon the Mosaic Law; rather he deepened its meaning, emphasized its spirit (love, mercy, justice), and lived it out perfectly. *“Heaven and earth”* are still here, so according to Jesus the Law remains in effect【28†L226-L234】.

Paul, however, taught *“a different gospel.”* His letters repeatedly deemphasize or nullify commandments that Jesus and Moses upheld. For example: 

- **On the Law in general:** Jesus said the Law would not disappear and that our righteousness must exceed that of the law-keeping Pharisees (Matt. 5:18-20). Paul argued, by contrast, *“a man is not justified by observing the law”* and *“if you try to be justified by law, you are **severed from Christ**”*【23†L105-L113】【41†L1-L4】. He even identified himself as a proud ex-Pharisee【23†L109-L116】 yet taught that pursuing righteousness via obedience leads one to “fall from grace”【39†L171-L179】. This is the polar opposite of Jesus’ assertion that obeying God’s commands *is doing God’s will* (Matt. 7:21). 

- **On judging others:** Jesus taught *“Do not judge… do not condemn”* (Luke 6:37). Paul instructed *“it **certainly is your responsibility to judge** those inside the church who are sinning”* (1 Cor. 5:12)【28†L238-L246】, actively policing other believers’ behavior – a direct contradiction of Jesus’ command to show mercy and leave ultimate judgment to God.

- **On salvation and commandments:** Jesus, when asked about eternal life, pointed to keeping the commandments (Matt. 19:16-18) and summed up the law in love of God and neighbor (Matt. 22:36-40). Paul’s message centered not on continued obedience, but on **belief in Jesus’ death and resurrection** as the sole means of salvation: *“If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and **believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead**, you will be saved”*【43†L10-L18】. Not once does that salvation formula mention obedience to God’s laws or repentance from lawlessness. Paul even taught that *“Christ abolished the law of commandments”* on the cross (Eph. 2:15) and that the written code was “nailed to the cross” (Col. 2:14). Such statements **flatly contradict** Jesus’ proclamation that he did *“not come to abolish the Law”* (Matt. 5:17).

In sum, **Paul diverges from Jesus on the necessity of law-keeping.** Where Jesus upheld Torah (saying *“Whoever keeps and teaches [the Law] will be called great”*), Paul often **downplayed or opposed Torah observance**, especially for Gentiles. Little wonder that some early Christian sects (such as the Nazarenes/Ebionites) rejected Paul as an interloper, and that even the apostle Peter warned that Paul’s epistles contain difficult teachings which the “ignorant and unstable twist… **to their own destruction**” (2 Pet. 3:15-17). Jesus commissioned apostles to *“make disciples… teaching them to observe all that I have commanded”* (Matt. 28:20); Paul, who was not among the Twelve, instead propagated a **new doctrine** centered on grace apart from works of the Law. As we will see, this “new teaching” aligns eerily with the pattern of deception the Bible forewarns.

**A “New Covenant” or a New Error? – Paul’s Novel Gospel of Resurrection:**  Paul’s message introduced concepts largely absent from the original Sinai covenant – most notably, the idea that **faith in the resurrection** of Christ guarantees salvation. Under the Old Covenant, atonement was obtained through repentance, prayer, and sacrificial obedience to God’s instructions. Nowhere did Moses say that believing in someone’s resurrection would save you; rather, each person was to *“choose life… by loving the Lord, obeying His voice, and holding fast to Him”*【48†L354-L362】. Yet Paul declares that *“if you believe in your heart that God raised [Jesus] from the dead, you **will be saved**”*【43†L10-L18】. This **simple creed** of confessing Jesus and believing in the resurrection as the ticket to eternal life is a **new teaching** not grounded in the Torah or even in Jesus’ own preaching (Jesus preached the gospel of the Kingdom, calling people to repent and do God’s will, e.g. Mark 1:14-15, Matthew 7:21).

To be clear, Jesus and the apostles did testify to His resurrection as a vindication of His Messiahship, but **never did Jesus teach that mere belief in the event of resurrection nullifies the requirement of obeying God.** Yet Paul’s doctrine of *sola fide* (faith alone) and *sola gratia* (grace alone) effectively **undermined the necessity of continued obedience.** He taught that *“by grace you have been saved, through faith… not of works”* (Eph. 2:8-9) and even claimed that those who attempt to keep certain commandments (like circumcision or Sabbath) *“have fallen from grace”* (Gal. 5:4)【39†L171-L179】. In Paul’s view, Christ’s death and resurrection **initiated a new covenant** where the **law is written on hearts** (he appeals to this in Romans 7:6 and 2 Cor. 3:6) and thus external observances are secondary. But this interpretation clashes with the **explicit prophecies** of the new covenant (Jer. 31:33, Ezek. 36:27) wherein God writes the same Torah in the hearts of His people so that *they will obey it.* Paul’s version turned the covenant upside down – making the Law appear as a hindrance rather than a delight (contrary to Psalm 119).

In fact, respected scholars (and critics) have noted that **Paul introduced a radically new religion**. For example, theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur and Jewish scholar Hyam Maccoby (in *The Mythmaker*) argue that Paul transformed the Jewish Jesus movement into something entirely different – a Greco-Roman mystery faith centered on a dying-and-rising savior and personal salvation through his resurrection. This is exactly what Moses warned against: *“If **your brother**… or **a prophet** entices you saying, ‘Let us go after other gods’ which you have not known”* – in other words, another way of worship or path of salvation – *“you shall not listen… for the Lord your God is testing you”* (Deut. 13:6-8). While Paul did not explicitly say “worship other gods,” he **redefined worship of the true God** in a way that **nullified God’s prior commands**. According to the Torah, that is just as dangerous. The Law was given as a tree of life; to discard it for Paul’s “gospel” of an easier path is akin to Eve eating from the forbidden tree because it looked desirable. We next turn to the biblical warnings about false prophets to see how they foreshadow Paul’s role.

## 2. Biblical Warnings of False Prophets: Deuteronomy, Ezekiel, and Jesus’ Words

The Bible is replete with warnings that **false prophets** and deceivers would arise from within the community of faith to lead people astray. Three key passages – Deuteronomy 13, Ezekiel 13, and Jesus’ own teaching in Matthew 7 – provide a profile of these imposters. We will analyze each, including the original language terms for *“lawlessness”* and *“deception,”* and show how they line up with Paul’s behavior and message.

**Deuteronomy 13 – The False Prophet Test:** In the Torah, Moses set the standard for discerning truth from error. **Deuteronomy 13:1-5** (Hebrew numbering 13:2-6) warns that even if a prophet gives a sign or wonder that comes to pass, if his message **departs from God’s law**, he is a fraud. Specifically, Moses says if the prophet urges, *“Let us go after other gods,”* or in any way *“turns you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to walk,”* you must *“not listen to that prophet”*【10†L343-L351】. Such a person is *“urging rebellion against the Lord”* and must be put to death for inciting apostasy【10†L349-L354】. The key phrase in verse 3-5 is that the false prophet seeks to **turn people from the way** of God’s commands – *“rebellion”* in Hebrew is **סָרָה** (*sarah*), meaning *to turn aside or apostatize*. In verse 5, it says *“he has **incited rebellion** against the Lord… to turn you from the way your God commanded you”*【10†L349-L354】. Thus, **the criterion is not false miracles or failed predictions (though elsewhere false prophecy is marked by lies), but false *teaching*** – teaching that contradicts or abolishes God’s prior commands.

Measured against this Torah yardstick, Paul’s teachings raise serious red flags. Paul did not say “let’s worship Baal” – but he did tell people *not to obey certain commands of God*. This is **precisely equivalent** in effect. Deuteronomy 13 doesn’t require the deceiver to explicitly name a false god; *simply leading people away from obeying God* is enough to brand him false. As one Bible commentary puts it: *“A false prophet who incites rebellion is guilty of death under God's Law. A person who encourages others to rebel against the teachings of the Bible [Torah] must be rejected”*【0†L13-L21】. Paul encouraged Jews **not** to circumcise (despite Genesis 17:13 calling it an “everlasting covenant”) and told Gentiles they need not observe God’s dietary laws or festival days (contrary to Leviticus 11, Deut. 14, etc.). He even taught *against* the Fourth Commandment Sabbath, writing *“Let no one judge you in regard to… a Sabbath day. These are a shadow… but the substance belongs to Christ”* (Col. 2:16-17)【37†L98-L106】. By relegating God’s Sabbath to a mere shadow and telling believers they are free to disregard it, Paul **instructed disobedience** to a Ten Commandment law – effectively *“inciting rebellion”* as per Deut. 13. In fact, Christian reformers like **Martin Luther** openly acknowledged that *“Paul abolished the Sabbath”*【37†L107-L115】, and theologian **John Calvin** commented on Colossians 2: *“We see now that the Sabbath is **done away with**… Paul proclaimed the end of the Sabbath”*【37†L110-L118】【37†L120-L128】. A modern analysis on Paul concludes: *“Paul taught believers in Christ (whether Jew or Gentile) not to follow a command from God in the Ten Commandments… which **proves him a false prophet** (Deut. 13:1-5)”*【38†L7-L15】. By Moses’ definition, **no amount of truth Paul spoke elsewhere could compensate for this fatal flaw**: *the advocacy of “lawlessness” (Torah-lessness) in the name of God.* 

It’s worth noting Moses’ further comment: such a deceiver may be allowed by God as a **test** of whether His people *“love the Lord with all their heart and soul”* (Deut. 13:3). Will they follow a charismatic teacher who works wonders, or remain loyal to God’s word? This is a sobering thought when considering Paul, who indeed worked “signs and wonders” among the Gentiles (Romans 15:19, Acts 19:11-12) and yet taught against elements of God’s Law. According to Deuteronomy, **miracles are not proof of authenticity** – loyalty to God’s commandments is. Thus, even if Paul’s ministries and martyrdom seem impressive, the ultimate test is Deut. 13: did he steer people **toward** or **away from** the Torah? The record shows he led many away, cloaking disobedience in a message of grace and freedom. As Jesus said, *“Scripture cannot be broken”* (John 10:35) – not even by an angelic apparition or a voice from heaven (Paul claimed Jesus appeared to commission him). Little wonder Paul’s fiercest critics (both ancient and modern) have dubbed him **“the Deuteronomy 13 test case”** for a false apostle.

**Ezekiel 13 – Woe to the False Prophets of Israel:** The prophet Ezekiel, living during the Babylonian exile, also delivered scathing rebukes to self-appointed prophets who spoke their own imaginations rather than God’s truth. In Ezekiel 13, the Lord says: *“Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!* Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. *…They say, ‘Thus says the Lord,’ when the Lord has not sent them, and yet they expect their words to be fulfilled”*【15†L342-L351】. God condemns those prophets for **“leading My people astray”** with lies, **“crying ‘Peace’ when there is no peace”**, and whitewashing over the nation’s sins【15†L359-L367】. He declares, *“My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations”*【15†L354-L362】. They encouraged the people in disobedience rather than calling out their transgressions (see Ezek. 13:22). 

How does this relate to Paul? Notably, Ezekiel 13 isn’t directly about Paul, but it sets a principle: **true prophets uphold God’s righteousness and call people to repentance, whereas false prophets offer easy messages that foster disobedience.** They *“whitewash”* over breaches in the moral wall rather than repair them【15†L345-L353】【15†L359-L367】. Paul’s letters to the Gentile churches often took a lenient stance toward law observance, effectively saying “it’s all fine, you are at peace with God through faith” even as those converts neglected commandments like Sabbath, dietary laws, and circumcision. Paul himself wrote, *“To those without the law, I became like one without the law”* (1 Cor. 9:21), boasting how he would behave *“as without Law”* to win the lawless【6†L17-L22】. This chameleon-like approach – *“I have become all things to all men”* (1 Cor. 9:22) – might be seen as “whitewashing” sin. Instead of confronting Gentile believers with the full demands of God’s holiness as defined in the Torah, Paul often **smoothed over** the differences, assuring them they need not carry the “yoke” of the Law (see Gal. 5:1-3, Acts 15:19). 

Ezekiel also uses an animal metaphor: he says false prophets are *“like **jackals** among ruins”* (Ezek. 13:4). “Jackals” (or foxes) scavenging among a broken wall portray selfish opportunists who **profit from the nation’s spiritual brokenness** rather than healing it. Later in Ezekiel 22:27, corrupt leaders are compared to *“wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives for dishonest gain.”* This wolf imagery will be crucial when we examine Jacob’s prophecy about Benjamin and Jesus’ warning about *“wolves in sheep’s clothing.”* The *common thread* is ferocity and destruction lurking behind a façade of religiosity.

Linguistically, **Ezekiel 13** emphasizes *sheqer* (שקר, “falsehood/lies”) and *kazab* (“deception”) – the prophets “utter lying divinations”【15†L349-L357】. They **claim God’s authority for their own ideas.** Paul likewise frequently asserts divine authority for his teaching – *“I received it by revelation of Jesus Christ”* (Gal. 1:12) – and defends himself with boasts that sound alarmingly self-authoritative (e.g. *“If anyone thinks they are a prophet or spiritual, let them acknowledge that what I write to you are the Lord’s commands”*, 1 Cor. 14:37). Such claims must be tested against God’s prior word. When tested, Paul’s message does **not** align with Torah or the words of Jesus – implying that his **“revelations”** might be of human (or even demonic) origin rather than from God. Like the prophets in Ezekiel’s day, Paul *“followed his own spirit”* in many respects, going beyond what the Lord ever said. The *woe* pronounced in Ezekiel should give us pause – God is *against* those who speak presumption in His name (Ezek. 13:8-9). If Paul did this, it is a fearful indictment.

**Jesus’ Warning (Matthew 7:15-23) – False Prophets as Ravenous Wolves:** In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explicitly alerted his followers to **beware of false prophets** who would come in a deceptive guise. *“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are **ravenous wolves**,”* Jesus said【19†L186-L194】. He invoked the image of a wolf – a predator – dressed as a harmless sheep, mingling among God’s flock. This vivid metaphor indicates that the false prophets would *appear to be part of the flock (i.e. believers)* and would look innocent, but their true nature would be fierce, greedy, and destructive. How to discern them? *“You will know them by their fruits… a bad tree bears bad fruit… Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. So then, by their **fruits** you will know them”*【19†L191-L199】【19†L201-L209】. In other words, examine the outcome of their teaching – does it produce genuine righteousness (obedience to God) or lawlessness and sin? Do they themselves exhibit humility and truth, or pride and deceit?

Notably, Jesus connects false prophets with **“lawlessness.”** In Matthew 7:21-23, he describes how on Judgment Day *“many will say to Me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and do many wonders in Your name?’”* – clearly these “many” are people claiming to represent Jesus (doing things “in Jesus’ name”). But Jesus will shockingly reply: *“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice **lawlessness**!”*【19†L225-L233】. The Greek word here for “lawlessness” is **ἀνομία (anomia)**【19†L227-L233】. This term literally means *“violation of law”* – specifically, **violation of God’s Law (Torah)**【17†L109-L118】【17†L125-L132】. As a Greek lexicon explains, *anomia* denotes *“contempt and violation of law, wickedness”*【17†L121-L129】 – essentially, **Torah-lessness**【17†L133-L141】. Jesus is saying that no matter what miracles or prophecies someone may have done ostensibly for Him, if that person **led a life of lawlessness or promoted lawlessness, Christ will reject them.** 

This is a sobering criterion. By it, **Paul stands on extremely shaky ground**. Paul did many things “in Jesus’ name” – preaching, casting out demons (Acts 16:18), healing the sick (Acts 19:11-12) – and many call him *“Lord, Lord.”* Yet he also taught *“violation of [God’s] law”* by telling people they are not under that law. The term Jesus used, *anomia*, perfectly encapsulates the thrust of Paul’s doctrine: through a misapplication of grace, it effectively amounted to *Torah rejection*. A scholarly devotion notes: *“The Greek word is **anomia**, and it literally means ‘without law.’”*【16†L25-L33】. Jesus could well say to a law-abolishing teacher, “I never knew you.” Indeed, as soon as Jesus speaks of wolves in sheep’s clothing, he may have been alluding to the **“ravenous wolf”** of Benjamin (we will explore that shortly). It cannot be overlooked that **Paul fits this profile**: **an Israelite of Benjamin who behaved like a wolf, and whose teachings resulted in widespread lawlessness** among gentile believers.

To drive home the point, notice Jesus’ emphasis on **fruit**. What are the fruits of Paul’s teachings? Historically, Pauline doctrine gave rise to a form of Christianity disconnected from its Hebrew roots – a largely Gentile church that for centuries *abandoned the Sabbath, Biblical festivals, dietary laws, and other commandments*, teaching that the Old Testament law was obsolete. The tragic fruit of this was not only spiritual antinomianism (rejection of law), but often anti-Judaism – viewing the Law and the Jews who kept it with contempt. Meanwhile, Jesus’ original Jewish apostles in Jerusalem remained *“zealous for the Law”* even after Christ’s resurrection (Acts 21:20). The contrast in fruit is stark: the Jerusalem assembly produced saints known for their piety and adherence to God’s commands (Acts 21:20, 24; Rev. 12:17), whereas Paul’s churches (e.g. Corinth, Galatia) struggled with confusion, division, and moral laxity (1 Cor. 5:1-2, Gal. 5:13-15). Jesus said a **good tree** cannot bear bad fruit, but a **bad tree** will bear bad fruit【19†L193-L202】. If Paul’s law-neglecting gospel was a good tree, it would have borne the fruit of holiness and obedience; instead, it often yielded **lawlessness** – precisely what Jesus condemned【19†L227-L233】. 

*Linguistic Note:* Jesus’ phrase *“ravenous wolves”* in Greek is **λύκοι ἅρπαγες (lukoi harpages)**【23†L115-L123】. *Harpax* means rapacious, grasping, devouring – a perfect description of Benjamin’s tribal symbol (a wolf that devours prey). The link between *“wolf”* and *“lawlessness”* in Matthew 7 is significant. It suggests the false prophet will have a **voracious appetite (for power, followers, or influence) and will prey upon the flock**, all while promoting a path of disobedience. Does this sound familiar? Paul unabashedly sought preeminence among the churches, even boasting, *“I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles”*【5†L281-L289】, and he *“labored more abundantly than they all”*【5†L297-L303】. He claimed a higher authority and scope than Jesus’ hand-picked Twelve (calling himself *“apostle to the Gentiles”* with an exclusive mission – see Gal. 2:7-8, Rom. 11:13). Paul’s letters also reveal a *domineering streak*: he scolds the Corinthians for listening to other (true) apostles, saying *“no one can stop me from boasting”* in his self-appointed region【5†L281-L289】. Such ambition and pride (“ravenous” ego) are hallmarks of the bad tree. Meanwhile, he derided the need to keep God’s “old” laws, effectively giving license to sin under the banner of grace (Romans 6:14-15) – the very definition of *anomia*. By matching Jesus’ prophecy with Paul’s legacy, the pieces fall into place: **Paul is the wolf in sheep’s clothing, feigning godliness yet devouring the flock by means of lawlessness.**

Before proceeding, let’s summarize the **key terms** identified and their application to Paul:

- **“False prophet” (pseudoprophētēs)** – one who claims to speak for God but whose message contradicts God’s prior revelation. Paul claimed to receive the gospel directly from Jesus, yet preached against God’s Law – qualifying as false by Deut. 13【10†L347-L354】.

- **“Rebellion” / “apostasy” (Heb. *sarah* or *nadach*)** – turning people away from God’s commandments【10†L349-L354】. Paul’s teaching not to circumcise or keep Sabbath caused apostasy from Torah among gentiles, making him guilty of *sarah*.

- **“Lawlessness” (Gk. *anomia*)** – literally *without law*, violation of Torah【17†L125-L133】【19†L227-L233】. Jesus said *anomia* is the mark of those He will reject【19†L225-L233】. Paul taught believers they were *not under the law*, a doctrine of *anomia* disguised as “freedom.” The Greek word *anomia* in Matthew 7:23 is the same word used to describe the “man of lawlessness” in 2 Thess. 2:3-7 – a figure many identify with the end-times deceiver. It is chilling that Paul’s own teaching could be characterized as *anomia*.

- **“Deception” (Gk. *planē*, Heb. *sheqer*)** – falsehood that misleads. Paul wrote of *“deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of Christ”* (2 Cor. 11:13), perhaps not realizing he was indicting himself. He even admitted to using cunning: *“I caught you by trickery”* (2 Cor. 12:16). Such *sheqer* is condemned by God【15†L349-L357】.

- **“Wolf” (Heb. *ze’ev*, Gk. *lukos*)** – a predatory figure associated with Benjamin’s tribe【34†L340-L347】 and used by Jesus for false prophets【19†L186-L194】. As we will now explore, the **Benjamin connection** provides a startling prophetic fingerprint pointing directly to Paul.

## 3. Paul as the “Bad Tree”: A Ravenous Wolf from Benjamin Producing Corrupt Fruit

Having established the general profile of false prophets, we now turn to specific evidence identifying **Paul himself** as the one in question. In Scripture, there is an intriguing trail of breadcrumbs linking **the tribe of Benjamin, wolves, and lawlessness** – all roads that lead to Saul of Tarsus (Paul), the Benjamite who became Christianity’s most controversial apostle. By examining Jacob’s prophecy over Benjamin, the tribe’s history of rebellion, Paul’s own confessions, and his clashes with the Jerusalem church, we will see a consistent pattern that marks Paul as the **“bad tree” bearing bad fruit**.

**Jacob’s Prophecy (Genesis 49:27) – “Benjamin is a Ravenous Wolf”:** On his deathbed, the patriarch Jacob pronounced prophecies over each of the twelve tribes. Of his youngest son Benjamin, Jacob uttered a cryptic foretelling: *“Benjamin is a **ravenous wolf**; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the plunder”*【34†L340-L347】. This description paints Benjamin’s descendants as fierce, predatory, and violent. Historically, this was manifested in several ways. The tribe of Benjamin produced warriors noted for their ferocity – for example, Ehud the judge (who assassinated Moab’s king), King Saul (who ruthlessly pursued David), and the Benjamite fighters in Judges 19–20 who fell into moral depravity and civil war. In fact, the **tribe of Benjamin became infamous for a grievous rebellion** in the time of the judges: when some Benjamites committed atrocity, the tribe collectively defended the perpetrators against the rest of Israel, resulting in a war that nearly wiped out Benjamin (Judges 19–21). The Bible notes that *“the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren”* (Judg. 20:13) and that in those days Israel had no king, *“everyone did what was right in his own eyes”* (Judg. 21:25) – a picture of lawlessness. Benjamin was thus **characterized by stubbornness and rebellion** from early on. As one commentator observes, *“Benjamin was historically hostile, and… maybe more hostile than the other tribes”*【56†L1-L4】. This tribe’s **“wolf-like”** aggression and tendency to devour and divide certainly aligns with Jacob’s words.

Now consider: **Paul was a Benjamite.** He himself proudly stated, *“I too am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, **of the tribe of Benjamin**”* (Romans 11:1), and *“of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews”* (Philippians 3:5)【23†L128-L134】. Thus Paul literally springs from the “wolf tribe.” Could it be that Jacob’s ancient prophecy had a long-range target in Paul? Some early Christians thought so. There is evidence that the Ebionites (Jewish Christians who opposed Paul) saw him as the fulfillment of “Benjamin the wolf.” Even modern analysts note the uncanny link: *“Paul was a Benjamite… **Genesis 49:27**: ‘Benjamin is a ravenous wolf…’”*【30†L502-L510】. In Paul’s life, the *“morning”* and *“evening”* of the prophecy could be allegorical: in the morning of his career, Saul *“devoured his prey”* – he ravaged the church, *“breathing threats and murder against the disciples”* (Acts 9:1-2). Like a ravenous wolf, he hunted the flock of Christ, supervising the stoning of Stephen and imprisoning believers (Acts 8:1-3). Then, in the “evening” of his life (after his supposed conversion), he *“divided the spoil.”* This can be seen as Paul dividing Christ’s flock, taking a huge “spoil” of Gentile converts away from the influence of the original apostles to form his own assemblies. He even claimed the Twelve agreed to partition the mission field, *“They gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that **we should go to the Gentiles** and they to the Jews”* (Gal. 2:9). In effect, Paul “divided” the Church into a Gentile wing under his supervision and a Jewish wing under Peter/James. This *division itself was not commanded by Jesus* (who told the apostles collectively to be His witnesses “to the ends of the earth” with no mention of a separate Gentile authority). It reflects Paul “dividing the plunder” of souls – a telling echo of *“in the evening he divides the spoil”*【34†L340-L347】. 

The phrase “ravenous wolf” also resonates with Jesus’ warning, as we saw. It is as if **Jacob’s prophecy and Jesus’ warning meet in Paul**: Jacob identifies the **tribal origin** (“a wolf…Benjamin”) and Jesus identifies the **role** (“false prophet…a wolf in sheep’s clothing”). Indeed, early Christian writings like the apocryphal Acts of Paul and the pseudo-Clementine literature contain implicit criticisms of Paul, associating him with Simone Magus or with deception. The pieces fit too well to be coincidence. Paul emerged from Benjamite stock, exhibited wolf-like persecution, and later, as a “Christian,” claimed to be as harmless as a sheep (a follower of the Lamb) all while introducing doctrines that tore at the fabric of God’s commandments – a predator in wool. 

**The Tribe of Benjamin in Rebellion – a Pattern Culminating in Paul:** We’ve mentioned the episode in Judges where Benjamin defended wicked men rather than uphold righteousness, leading to war. That event has fascinating parallels to Paul’s story. The Benjamites of Gibeah had committed a gross sin (Judges 19), and the other tribes demanded justice. Benjamin not only refused, but fought to protect the evildoers, slaughtering tens of thousands of fellow Israelites in two days (Judg. 20:21, 25). Only after massive bloodshed were the Benjamites defeated, nearly to extinction【21†L109-L117】【21†L115-L123】. It’s as if Benjamin has a propensity to **fight against its brethren** and **resist divine order** to the bitter end. Similarly, in the book of Acts, when Paul is confronted about his teachings, a riot breaks out and bloodshed is only narrowly avoided by Roman intervention (Acts 21:30-36). Throughout his ministry, Paul’s presence often caused **division and conflict** among brethren: in Antioch he split with Barnabas (Acts 15:39), in Galatia his teachings split the church over law vs. grace (Gal. 3:1-5, 5:1-4), and in Corinth factions arose claiming “I follow Paul” vs. “I follow Peter” (1 Cor. 1:12-13). This *dividing of the brethren* is very much in the Benjamite-wolf character. As Jesus said, *“a house divided against itself cannot stand”* – and tragically, Paul’s influence led to a lasting schism between Law-observant Jewish Christians and Law-free Gentile Christians, a division that persists to this day in various forms.

Interestingly, the **very name** “Benjamin” can be connected to the New Testament warnings. Moses in Deuteronomy 33:12 blessed Benjamin as *“the beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him.”* The name can mean “son of the right hand” (a position of favor). But Benjamin also had an earlier name: Ben-Oni, “son of my sorrow,” given by Rachel as she died bearing him (Gen. 35:18). In a spiritual sense, one might poetically say that Paul (a Benjamite) became a “son of sorrow” for the true church – causing grief by his teachings – even as he claimed to be beloved and favored by God. This is speculative, but worth pondering. What’s concrete is Paul’s **self-identification**: he invokes his Benjamite heritage to defend his credentials【23†L128-L134】, likely prideful of Jacob’s blessing over Benjamin as a mighty warrior. Yet he either failed to see or refused to acknowledge the ominous aspect of that prophecy – the ravenous wolf. Perhaps Paul considered himself a *“wolf”* in a *positive* sense – zealously devouring God’s enemies. Remember, he initially saw Christians as heretics and *“persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it”* (Gal. 1:13). After “conversion,” he swapped targets: now, instead of killing Christians, he metaphorically *devoured the Torah*, casting it aside, and *divided the church’s unity* as noted. Thus, the **Benjamite prophecy finds its fullest, most spiritual fulfillment in Paul’s career**, more so than in any other single Benjamite figure in Scripture.

**Paul’s Own Admissions – Proud Benjamite and Master of Deception:** Paul not only was of Benjamin by lineage, he often operated in the *manner* of a wolf – cunning and aggressive. In his epistles we catch glimpses of this: *“If by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh (Jews) and save some of them”* (Rom. 11:14) – here Paul speaks of *provoking* his fellow Jews. In Acts, we see him deliberately create dissension between Pharisees and Sadducees to escape charges (Acts 23:6-10). He was shrewd and not above manipulation. In 2 Corinthians 12:16, confronting detractors, he says ironically, *“Actually, I was crafty, and **I caught you by trickery**!”*【30†L525-L533】. Although he then tries to defend himself, the admission that he employed trickery is telling. It calls to mind the behavior of a predator using clever ruses to trap prey. Contrast this with Jesus, who had no deceit in His mouth (1 Pet. 2:22) and who *“did nothing in secret”* (John 18:20). Paul, in contrast, *“became as one under the law to those under the law… and as one not under the law to those without it”*【6†L17-L22】, essentially play-acting as needed. This **duplicity** is a hallmark of false teachers and is exactly how a *wolf in sheep’s clothing* would operate – changing outward appearance to blend with the target audience.

Moreover, Paul **clashed directly with Jesus’ hand-picked apostles**, another indicator of something amiss. In Galatians 2:11-14, Paul recounts how he **publicly opposed Peter (Cephas)** in Antioch over the matter of eating with Gentiles, accusing him and Barnabas of hypocrisy. The sheer audacity of a newcomer (Paul) rebuking the chief apostle Peter – whom Jesus called the rock of the church – should give us pause. Paul had no problem setting himself above Peter’s authority. He also dismissed the Jerusalem apostles somewhat coldly, saying *“those who seemed to be pillars – it makes no difference to me what they were”* (Gal. 2:6) and claiming *“those esteemed as leaders contributed nothing to me”* (2:6). He even labeled some Jewish believers as *“false brethren secretly brought in”* simply because they insisted on circumcision (Gal. 2:4). This abrasive, boastful attitude toward the original Apostles (the ones taught directly by Jesus) is deeply troubling. It suggests Paul saw **himself** as the ultimate arbiter of the gospel, accountable to no one. The fruit of this conflict was confusion in the churches: many struggled with whether to follow Paul’s lenient approach or the Jerusalem church’s instruction to **observe at least some parts of the Law** (see Acts 15:19-21, where the apostles directed Gentiles to abstain from idolatry, sexual immorality, blood, and strangled meat). Paul in his letters never explicitly mentions the decree’s requirements, and in the case of food sacrificed to idols – he outright contradicts it, advising the Corinthians that they could eat such meat as long as it didn’t bother their conscience (1 Cor. 8:4-13, 10:25-28). Thus, Paul **set himself against the authority of the Jerusalem elders** and against the very Temple regulations (avoiding idol pollution) they upheld. It is hard not to see in this the fulfillment of *“teaching against… the law and this place [Temple]”* as the Jerusalem mob accused【54†L36-L44】. Paul’s presence and teaching led to *“no small dissension”* (Acts 15:2) – corrupt fruit indeed.

**Grace and Resurrection vs. Law – the Serpent’s Seduction Repackaged:** Perhaps the most sinister aspect of Paul’s doctrine is how it mixes **truth with error**, reminiscent of the Serpent’s tactics in Eden. Paul certainly taught some truth – he preached Jesus as the Messiah, emphasized love as the greatest command, and upheld personal morality in many areas. This “good” is like the appealing aspect of the forbidden fruit. But he mixed in the “evil” of lawlessness – asserting that observing God’s commandments was not necessary for salvation, even a hindrance. This combination of *good and evil* is exactly what the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil represented. It was a fruit that did impart some knowledge (their eyes were opened), but it also brought death through disobedience. Paul’s gospel likewise imparts spiritual knowledge – but embedded in it is the deadly poison of rejecting God’s life-giving law. In Eden, the serpent assured Eve, *“You will not surely die”* for breaking God’s command (Gen. 3:4). Paul echoes a similar refrain: *“We are released from the law”* (Rom. 7:6), *“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law”* (Gal. 3:13), implying that one need not fear the death penalty of the Law – as long as one “believes.” Effectively, **“You shall not surely die (for breaking the law), for grace will save you.”** This is a **deceptive half-truth.** Yes, Christ’s grace covers our sins *if we repent* – but Paul’s version downplayed repentance and obedience, focusing almost exclusively on belief. Thus many were lulled into a false sense of security, thinking they could persist in violating parts of God’s Law without eternal consequence because they were “under grace.” Jude 1:4 warns of exactly this: *“ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness.”* Paul’s teaching that *“all things are lawful for me”* (1 Cor. 10:23, a slogan he bandied about) and that one is *“not under law”* could easily be exploited to justify licentious behavior – and indeed, that happened (see Romans 3:8, where Paul acknowledges people accused him of promoting “do evil that good may come”). A good tree (Jesus, Moses, the prophets) gives pure truth – like the Tree of Life, its fruit only nourishes. A bad tree (false prophet) gives mixed fruit – appealing but laced with rebellion.

Finally, recall that **the Tree of Life** in the Garden was freely accessible until sin entered. Proverbs 3:18 calls God’s Wisdom (often equated with Torah) *“a Tree of Life to those who take hold of her.”* Jewish tradition explicitly says *“The Torah is called a ‘Tree of Life’ (Prov. 3:18)”*【57†L55-L63】, because *“like the Torah, trees support a healthy and sustainable environment in which life flourishes”*【57†L55-L63】. Observing God’s commandments leads to life and blessing【48†L342-L350】. By contrast, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil brought death – not because “knowledge” is bad, but because it represented *choosing one’s own way* over simple obedience, a mixture of truth and falsehood outside of God’s will【24†L27-L33】. In theological terms, **Torah = Tree of Life**, and **the Other Tree = man’s ideas, mixing good and evil**. Now we see the heart of the matter: **Paul’s doctrine was essentially eating from the wrong tree.** He took the sweet promises of God (forgiveness, resurrection, salvation in Messiah – all true goods), but mixed them with a premise of *disregarding God’s commandments*. The result is a systematic theology that is incredibly appealing (who doesn’t want eternal life as a free gift?), but ultimately poisonous – it severed countless believers from the nourishing “roots” of God’s Word, leaving them vulnerable to spiritual decay.

Thus, Paul’s **“grace apart from Law”** doctrine can be seen as the forbidden fruit of Christian theology – a tantalizing blend of divine truth and subtle lies. It is no coincidence that many of the earliest “church fathers” who followed Paul’s lead quickly sank into anti-nomian (anti-Law) attitudes and Hellenistic philosophies, which over centuries evolved into doctrines far removed from the Hebrew foundations laid by Moses and affirmed by Jesus. By adopting Paul’s teachings as the core of Christianity, the church effectively *“ate”* from the wrong tree. The catastrophic fruit borne over centuries – from the rejection and persecution of the Jews (due to seeing them as “law-obsessed and fallen from grace”) to moral laxity and doctrinal confusion – attests to the bad seed planted by the “false apostle.”

## 4. Paul’s Doctrine: The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil vs. the Torah as the Tree of Life

Let us tie together the allegory explicitly: In Genesis, humanity faced a choice between two trees. The **Tree of Life** symbolizes obedience and trust in God’s commands, leading to eternal life. The **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil** symbolizes deciding for oneself what is good or evil – a mixture of following some of God’s words while also indulging in disobedience. Adam and Eve’s tragic choice was to prefer the *mixed* knowledge over simple faithful obedience, and this led to death. 

In the spiritual sense, **God’s Law (Torah) has always been the Tree of Life** for His people. *“Keep My commandments and live,”* God says (Prov. 4:4). *“She [Wisdom/Torah] is a tree of life to those who take hold of her”* (Prov. 3:18). Those who *“lay hold”* of God’s instructions find length of days and blessing. By contrast, false teaching offers a *shortcut* to being “wise like God” without actually submitting to God (Gen. 3:5). Paul’s gospel presented just such a shortcut: be saved, be righteous, *independent of the Law.* It promised life (resurrection) and enlightenment (Paul often speaks of the “mystery” revealed to him) without the need to persevere in obedience to all of God’s commands. This is essentially *eating from the wrong tree*. It is a path that seems good for food and desirable for gaining wisdom – after all, Paul’s letters are intellectually rich and offer comfort to the sinner that he can be saved by grace. But in that food was the toxin of *anomia* (lawlessness). 

We can even see Paul’s doctrine as **the forbidden fruit within the New Testament canon**. It is notable that Peter, in the only verse referencing Paul in the Bible outside Paul’s own letters, gives a warning: Paul’s epistles contain “some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction” (2 Pet. 3:16). Immediately after, Peter says, *“So then, dear friends, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless (tēs tōn athesmōn planē – ‘the error of the lawless ones’) and fall from your secure position”* (2 Pet. 3:17). **“Error of the lawless.”** Is this not exactly what we have seen with Paul? People misunderstanding (or correctly understanding!) Paul’s hard statements about the Law ended up in *error* and *lawlessness*. Peter’s antidote is telling: *“grow in the grace AND knowledge of our Lord Jesus”* (3:18) – implying grace must be paired with true knowledge (sound doctrine) to avoid lawless error. The early church preserved Paul’s letters but not without a scriptural caution label courtesy of Peter. It’s as if God allowed the **“fruit”** of Paul’s teachings to hang in the garden of the New Testament, to test whether the faithful would adhere to **Jesus’ words** or be led astray by the enticing rhetoric of a man who claimed a new revelation.

**Mixing Truth and Error – Paul’s Partial Truth vs. Whole Truth:** We should acknowledge that Paul did not preach 100% heresy. That’s what made his deception effective. He taught about the one true God, the messiahship and resurrection of Jesus, the virtues of love, joy, and peace – all good fruit in themselves. But alongside those, he sowed seeds of discarding God’s commandments (for example, saying *“circumcision is nothing”* even though it was commanded by God, 1 Cor. 7:19). **He mixed good with evil**. In 2 Corinthians 11:14-15, Paul even says, *“Satan masquerades as an angel of light, so it is no surprise his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.”* These false apostles, he says, will be known *“by their works.”* Ironically, Paul might have been unwittingly describing himself – appearing as a servant of righteousness (talking about holiness, faith, etc.) but slipping in that deadly idea: *“you don’t need the works of the Law.”* 

The result is a gospel that **appears to honor God and Christ** (it has the form of godliness) but subtly denies God’s authority by nullifying His law – *“holding to a form of godliness, but denying its power”* (2 Tim. 3:5). The true power of godliness is a life transformed in obedience to God’s will (Rom. 12:2, Matt. 7:21). Paul’s gospel denied the power of practical obedience by saying it’s not required or it will automatically flow without the law – a claim history has proven false, as many “saved by faith” believers did not automatically become law-abiding saints. Instead, many became comfortable in a lax, worldly form of religion that might *“have the name that they live, but are dead”* (Rev. 3:1).

**Torah = Tree of Life, Paul’s Gospel = Tree of Death:** The early congregation in Jerusalem (led by James, Peter, John) clung to the Tree of Life – they continued to live *“in obedience to the Law”* (Acts 21:20-24) **and** faith in Jesus. They had both grace and law together. The church of the Gentiles founded by Paul cut itself off from the root of the olive tree (Romans 11 uses that metaphor, perhaps presciently – Paul warns Gentiles not to be arrogant or they’ll be cut off, which indeed happened as the Gentile church became arrogant toward the Law and Jews). By rejecting Torah, the Gentile church severed the source of spiritual life and became like a branch broken off – surviving only by the sap of a partial truth for a time, but lacking the stability and fruitfulness of the whole counsel of God. Moses said of the Torah: *“it is your life”* (Deut. 32:47). Proverbs 13:14 likewise: *“The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.”* When Paul told people to *depart from parts of the law*, he inadvertently led them into the snares of death – the same snares that caught Adam and Eve.

**Paul as the Biblical Motif of the Deceiver:** Throughout the Bible, we see recurring archetypes: the righteous man vs. the lawless, the true prophet vs. the false, the obedient vs. the rebellious. By now it should be evident that **Paul fits the archetype of the deceiver/false teacher** foretold in both Testaments:

- He arises from within God’s people (like the false prophets of Israel, or like an apostate among the apostles).
- He claims divine authority (visions of Jesus, miracles) to bolster his words【5†L253-L262】【5†L263-L270】.
- He **contradicts prior revelation** (saying no need to follow aspects of Mosaic law, counter to Moses and Jesus)【10†L347-L354】【28†L231-L238】.
- He exhibits pride and causes division (boasting of superior calling, disparaging established apostles)【5†L281-L289】【5†L293-L301】.
- He delivers a mixed message of truth and error (preaches Christ yet diminishes commandments).
- He is associated with the symbol of the wolf (Benjamin’s prophecy and Jesus’ warning)【34†L340-L347】【23†L119-L127】.
- His teaching leads to **“fruit” of lawlessness** (many Christians cease Torah observance, leading Jesus to potentially say “Depart from Me, you lawless”)【19†L225-L233】.
- He even proclaimed a different way to salvation (resurrection belief) that was not the one originally given, thus qualifying for Paul’s own curse: *“if anyone preaches a gospel contrary to what we preached, let him be accursed”* (Gal. 1:8). Ironically, Paul *did* preach a gospel contrary to what Jesus preached (compare Luke 18:18-22 with Rom. 10:9, for example). If an angel from heaven teaching a different gospel is accursed, how about a man from Benjamin teaching a different gospel?

One more intriguing prophecy: In Revelation 2:2, Jesus commends the Ephesian church: *“you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.”* Paul had a long association with Ephesus (Acts 19, and 1&2 Timothy which were set there). Could it be that some in Ephesus eventually **rejected Paul’s claims of apostleship**? The text fits the scenario of testing a self-proclaimed apostle and finding him false. The church at Ephesus in later generations did reject certain Pauline ideas (many early Asian churches were more Torah-observant). It is speculative but noteworthy.

**Conclusion:** Putting all the evidence together – the contrast between Paul’s teaching and Moses’/Jesus’ teachings, the alignment of Paul’s actions with the warnings of Deuteronomy 13, Ezekiel 13, and Matthew 7, the prophetic clue of Benjamin’s “ravenous wolf,” and the allegorical fulfillment of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil – we arrive at a startling but compelling conclusion: **Paul represents the false prophet who led many sincere believers away from the “Tree of Life” (God’s Law) by offering them a forbidden fruit – a “gospel” that mixed Christ’s truth with lawless deception.** 

He is the **“bad tree”** that produced the corrupt fruit of widespread disobedience under the guise of faith. He is the Benjaminite wolf in sheep’s clothing, whose letters outwardly speak of grace and righteousness but inwardly tear at the fabric of God’s covenant. To use Paul’s own words against him, he preached *“peace, peace” where there was no peace* – offering Gentiles *peace with God* while they violated God’s commands, a false peace that Ezekiel denounces【15†L359-L367】. By testing Paul’s teachings against the immutable Word of God, we find them **wanting**. Moses and Jesus both said that **love for God is shown by obeying His commandments** (Deut. 11:1, John 14:15). Paul said *no, it’s by faith alone apart from the Law*. Both cannot be right. *“Choose this day whom you will serve”* (Josh. 24:15) – the consistent voice of Scripture (the Lord and His true servants), or the alluring voice of one who came later preaching a shortcut.

In the end, the safest course for disciples of Jesus is to **heed Jesus’ own teachings first and foremost** and view Paul’s letters with great caution. Jesus is the Good Shepherd – He warned of wolves; He gave us criteria to spot them. By those criteria, Paul is unmasked. The ramifications are enormous: much of mainstream Christian theology must be re-examined in light of Jesus’ Torah-faithful message. But truth and restoration are possible if we return to the **“Tree of Life”** – embracing the whole counsel of God (Torah and Messiah together). *“To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them”* (Isaiah 8:20). Paul did not speak according to that original Word, and thus, however well-intentioned he may have been, **there was a fatal darkness in his message**. 

Let us therefore **not be led astray** by the apparent success or prevalence of Paul’s teachings. As Moses said, it may simply be God testing our love and loyalty【10†L343-L351】【10†L349-L354】. Let us “hold fast” to the Tree of Life – God’s commandments and the faith of Jesus (Rev. 14:12) – and not partake of the mixed fruit offered by Paul. In doing so, we align ourselves with the true prophets and apostles, and we distance ourselves from the *false prophet* who, though claiming to be Christ’s apostle, proved by his lawless doctrine and wolf-like fruits to be leading many down the broad path to destruction【19†L221-L228】【19†L227-L233】. 

**In conclusion,** Paul’s role in Christian Scripture should be viewed as a **cautionary tale** – an object lesson in how persuasive words and even genuine supernatural experiences (2 Cor. 12:1-7) do not validate a message that abolishes God’s law. The allegory of the two trees teaches us that *not everything that seems spiritually nourishing is truly life-giving.* Paul’s gospel, when measured against the unchanging standard of God’s Torah and Jesus’ teachings, is revealed as a counterfeit – a beautiful but deadly fruit. Those who seek eternal life must **return to the True Tree of Life**: the Messiah who *“did not abolish but fulfilled the Law,”* and whose apostles taught *“the observance of all that Jesus commanded.”* Only by rejecting the false prophet’s lure and re-embracing God’s commandments can we repair the breach and produce the good fruit that the Father desires. As Jesus admonished, *“If you love Me, keep My commandments”* – a simple test that exposes Paul’s error and guides us back to the path of life.

Okay, I want to expand your understanding of what I'm talking about so that we can tighten this up. To expand on what we've already said, the understanding that Moses foresaw Paul as a false prophet, and that the people would go into these other ways. And so, Moses offers a way for the people to be atoned when they sin through ignorance. And that is for them to make a sacrifice, and that will atone the people who have sinned through ignorance. And no fault of their own, but through ignorance. Okay? This is a group sin that Moses is talking about. He's talking about the group here. So this is the foreshadowing of the stumbling block that leads Israel astray. And Paul feels that it is his duty, his family legacy, to be the stumbling block, and he often talks about his special place. And he talks about his role, and he likens himself to Moses as a tester of the people. In that same chapter, I believe it's Romans, where he talks about he has great sorrow for Israel, because they're his people, and the oracles of judgment were given to them. And so, he feels that there is a special place for Israel, and those who have forsaken reading and understanding what God gave them are doomed to be punished. And so, for himself, forgiveness, he feels, is coming because he was called to do a certain thing. But this is the deeper understandings that Satan has, because even we know from the book of Job that Satan is a son of God, and he answers to God as well. And so, he has a certain leeway, because he plays a role in history, in this whole orchestration. But Paul's doctrine is the test of Israel following another God, or going another way. What we think of now, on a second point, as the crucifixion is a misunderstanding. It's a distortion of what happened, and it is a test to see if Israel, or if you love the God with all your heart and soul, as Moses and Jesus repeated. Now, Moses talks about this in the form of a test coming. It will be a test to see if you love the Lord your God. That test is that you serve no other gods. And so, when people look at the crucifixion, the test is of what they see. And this is a test of faithfulness to God's law, and a test of the heart at the same time. It's a testament to adherence to God's word and the law, because Moses already wrote about this. Jesus said, if you believe Moses, you will believe me, because he wrote about me. Now, where did he write about Jesus? Moses wrote about Jesus when he spoke of the atonement ritual. So this is what people confuse as a crucifixion. What actually happened is that Jesus went in to perform Moses's atonement ritual. Jesus was a Jewish man and had a Jewish ideology of how atonement would occur for Israel. And so he was the goat who went in, but there are two goats in the Levitical atonement ritual. And Jesus, as the scapegoat, would have to be unharmed in that ritual in order for atonement to occur. So while Jesus is the unharmed goat, there's a second goat, or a second bull, who is slaughtered for sin. Now that is the one who died on the cross. The reason we know this is because we can look at the structure of what happened on that day, and we can see that Pilate was the high priest who cast lots to see which lamb will be slaughtered and which one will be set free, carrying away the sins. And so when we look at the ritual, and we look at the events of the crucifixion, what we know as the crucifixion, then we see that all of these things occurred. Pilate casting lots, giving a choice on which Jesus, two identical goats basically, two identical rams or lambs, are offered, and the people are told to choose one. Now Pilate, we understand, and we know, did not want to crucify Jesus. He was a just person in this role. He was the high priest. And so being that the Jews could not even come into Pilate's place at that time, because they didn't want to be defiled and not be able to eat the Passover, they were at a distance and had no idea who he crucified. So it was easy for him to switch out or to crucify whomever he wanted. And so that's what he did. If we read the scriptures, we see that Judas was available to be crucified because he had come to the temple to give away the gold, to give back the silver, and to repent. So while he's often seen as a villain, the truth is that he facilitated the atonement ritual, and then he repented when he knew their intentions was to kill Jesus, because he said Jesus was a just man and I have sinned. So he becomes the sin goat. So he's the sin goat. And he, as the story is told, commits suicide or hangs himself. Well, this is the same thing that we call crucifixion, being hanged. So they hanged him. He offered himself voluntarily for the cross. And so Pilate acted knowingly, because he knew what the others were trying to do. And when he makes this statement, what is truth, he already has a plan on how to handle the crowds. So according to Ezekiel 12, 12, again, we see that the prince among you goes out secretly through a hole that is dug in the wall. And when we look at Ezekiel 12, the chapter, we see the son of man is told to pack his things to go out and he digs a hole in the wall. And he puts his things on his shoulder and goes out in the presence of the people. But the key to this is that they don't understand what it means because they're rebellious. Rebellious means that people are not following Moses's law and understanding through a lens of God acting for Israel. And this being the atonement ritual. And so when you look at it and you see the prophecy of Ezekiel 12, where he enacts it, the son of man goes out carrying the burden secretly. And then all of his people are scattered. Jesus refers to this himself when he says tonight you will all be scattered for my sake. When he goes in to offer himself. But the providence of God, as reflected in the story of Isaac, is that when he offers himself, God will create an alternative. And that's what God did when Isaac, the precursor to Jesus was saved and not killed. Now a wicked one says that this was a substitutionary sacrifice or substitutionary atonement, but doesn't understand that a substitute calls for another replacement being put in there. They say that Jesus is the replacement, but if he is a reflection of Isaac and what has been demonstrated and the scapegoat as well, then he is not the substitute. He is the one that God places a substitution in place of because he is God's favored son, just like Abraham's son, Abraham's only son, God's only son. These are parallels and so God's only son is also Israel and he is to be saved, not destroyed. So when Jesus is saved from the cross, it's not a resurrection, it is a substitution and that substitution then constitutes Moses's atonement ritual. So Judas is killed on the cross in place of Jesus. Jesus is secretly taken out and so there is no need for a resurrection if we already have atonement through the law. But Paul, talking to people who don't know the law, tells them that the law could not bring atonement. Well then either God is lying or Moses is lying or Paul is lying and deceiving people. The key distinction is believing that God fulfills his word and Moses' law and what he wrote about the atonement for Israel. So if Moses wrote about a process for atonement, Moses was writing a prophecy that would happen. So Jesus explains that Moses was writing about him when he wrote that. So therefore, if the ritual is to be followed, and Jesus as a Jewish man is performing this atonement, then he knows that there must be two goats that go in, and that really there should be three. But Peter ran away from his duty outside by the fire. See, he would have been the burnt offering of the bull, which occurs before the other sacrifice. And so it's all pictured and told in the Bible symbolically. So this leaves the priesthood uncleansed. And so that's why we have the ability for Paul to corrupt the church. And so Jesus also foretells of this with Peter, saying that the gates of hell would not prevail against the church. So Jesus builds, the church is built on Peter, but it is also built by the hands of those who would guide them into hell. But they won't prevail, because this truth is the truth, and the atonement has occurred. What remains is for the realization of what occurred, and the repentance and coming back. And that's the other forgiveness that Moses provided, that when the people have sinned unknowingly, then this ritual, which will be the killing of that bull, which is represented as the Benjamite, in the story where Sheba, son of Bichri, had led Israel astray against David, his head had to be thrown over the wall. That was how they stopped that wrath from happening. And so this man of iniquity is described and his destruction is described. And so the description of the end times is the reckoning with the truth of what happened at that time, and how the world has been led astray. world has been led astray.

This expansion adds a rich layer of prophetic and ritual analysis, particularly emphasizing the atonement ritual in Moses’ law and how it contrasts with Paul’s interpretation of salvation. Before proceeding with refining and tightening the argument, could you clarify:

1. **The Role of Pilate** – Do you want Pilate to be further analyzed as a high priest figure, casting lots in accordance with the atonement ritual? Should there be a deeper comparison between Pilate’s actions and the Yom Kippur scapegoat selection?

2. **Judas as the Sin Offering** – Do you want to explore deeper historical and textual evidence that Judas’ death (by hanging, which could be linked to crucifixion) fits into the role of the atonement sacrifice?

3. **Peter’s Role** – You mention Peter as a burnt offering, which would have completed the ritual. Should we examine Peter’s failure in this role more deeply, perhaps in connection with Jesus’ warning that Satan desired to sift him like wheat?

4. **Paul as the Stumbling Block** – Should we further highlight Paul’s awareness of his role as a tester of Israel, possibly expanding on passages where Paul compares himself to Moses and Israel’s history of stumbling?

5. **Substitution vs. Resurrection** – Should the argument be further expanded on how Jesus being spared and Judas taking his place nullifies the need for a resurrection narrative, and how Paul distorted this into a new theology?

6. **Final Prophetic Reckoning** – You mention the end times as the revelation of this deception. Should we explore further how this ties into eschatology, perhaps linking Paul to the ‘man of iniquity’ or ‘false prophet’ of Revelation and 2 Thessalonians?

Let me know if these points align with your vision, and I will refine the analysis accordingly.

Yes, but it's important that it's understood that this was all prophesied by Ezekiel in Ezekiel 12. Ezekiel is called the Son of Man over 80 times in the book of Ezekiel. This is why Jesus takes on the title, Son of Man. Ezekiel demonstrates with his body what is to happen to Israel. And so, it's important that we understand that this is not just a theory per se, but it is a real biblically based analysis.

---

I will now refine the analysis to integrate Ezekiel 12 as the prophetic blueprint for what transpired during the atonement ritual. This will include deeper examination of Pilate as a high priest figure, Judas as the sin offering, Peter’s role in the incomplete ritual, Paul’s self-awareness as the stumbling block, the substitution of Jesus instead of resurrection, and the final prophetic reckoning in eschatology.

Additionally, I will highlight how Jesus’ title, *Son of Man*, is directly derived from Ezekiel’s prophetic enactments, reinforcing that this is not just a theoretical interpretation but one grounded in biblical prophecy and textual analysis. The role of Ezekiel as the template for Jesus’ actions will be given special focus to ensure a clear theological foundation.

I will provide the refined and expanded analysis once it is ready.

# Ezekiel 12 as the Prophetic Blueprint

**Enacted Prophecies Foreshadowing Jesus’ Atonement:** The prophet Ezekiel was commanded to perform symbolic actions as prophecies – for example, packing his bags and digging through a wall to dramatize the coming exile (Ezk 12:5-7)【27†L1-L4】. These enacted prophecies form a **blueprint** for events in Jesus’ atonement ritual. Just as Ezekiel acted out Israel’s fate, Jesus **enacted** the ultimate Yom Kippur atonement: two figures were chosen (like two goats), one to bear sin and die, and one to be sent away alive. Ezekiel’s dramatic signs were “a warning for the people of Israel”【27†L1-L4】, and Jesus’ actions during His passion week likewise were a **living prophecy** fulfilling the Law’s requirements for atonement. Ezekiel’s role as a **priestly prophet** (he was from a priestly line and began ministry at 30, the age of priesthood【16†L107-L115】) foreshadowed the Messiah’s role in *enacting* Israel’s redemption through ritual. 

**“Son of Man” – Linking Ezekiel and Jesus:** Notably, God addresses Ezekiel as “*son of man*” over 90 times【16†L117-L125】, emphasizing his human representation of Israel. This title *“Son of Man”* was also Jesus’ preferred self-designation【16†L117-L125】. By calling Himself *Son of Man*, Jesus intentionally echoed Ezekiel’s mission of representing Israel’s condition. In both cases the title highlights identification with the people’s humanity【16†L117-L125】. Jesus adopts Ezekiel’s mantle, indicating that **He is reenacting Ezekiel’s prophetic signs** on a greater scale. Just as Ezekiel’s life and actions became a sign to Israel, Jesus’ life becomes the ultimate sign – **fulfilling** in reality what Ezekiel showed in metaphor. This linkage suggests Jesus saw Ezekiel’s prophecies as directly foreshadowing His own atoning work and Israel’s fate. 

**The Prince Escaping Through a Wall – A Secret Removal:** Ezekiel 12 contains a striking prophecy: *“The prince among them shall shoulder his load in the dark and go out through a hole dug in the wall; he will cover his face so he cannot see the land”*【30†L85-L93】. Historically, this referred to King Zedekiah sneaking out of Jerusalem only to be caught and blinded【20†L39-L47】【20†L53-L61】. But as a **prophetic blueprint**, it foreshadows the Messiah, “the Prince,” being removed in secret instead of being publicly executed. Jesus, the son of David, is a *Prince of Israel* (cf. Dan 9:25, Acts 5:31). According to this pattern, Jesus’ fate would involve a clandestine escape or removal, rather than an open crucifixion. Indeed, the Gospels hint at secrecy: Jesus was taken at night, and after His trial Pilate had Him inside the Praetorium away from the crowds (John 18:28)【34†L11-L19】. The prophecy’s details – carrying a load on the shoulder at twilight, digging through a wall, face covered – allude to Jesus being **removed from sight**. For example, Jesus was **blindfolded** by His captors (covering His face) during the mock trial (Luke 22:64), and after the sentencing, there may have been a hidden transfer. The image of digging through a wall suggests a hidden exit – analogous to Christ being taken **through a hidden way**, not by the public gate. In other words, Ezekiel’s “prince” prophecy symbolically points to Jesus *not* being the one visibly executed, but rather **slipping away** (as a scapegoat would), his fate hidden like the prince who covered his face【30†L91-L99】. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the crucifixion scene was a **substitution**, fulfilling Ezekiel’s sign that the leader of Israel would **go into exile unseen** rather than be killed in plain view. Jesus adopting “Son of Man” and fulfilling Ezekiel’s sign-acts indicates He was deliberately **demonstrating Israel’s fate** in Himself, just as Ezekiel had done【16†L117-L125】. The atonement ritual Jesus orchestrated followed Ezekiel’s prophetic template exactly: a symbolic drama in which the true fate of the *Son of Man* (and thus Israel) was hidden from those who did not have eyes to see, only to be revealed later.

# Pilate as the High Priest Figure

**Pilate Casting Lots – Yom Kippur Imagery:** Pontius Pilate, though a Roman governor, ends up playing the role of the **High Priest** in the atonement drama. In the Yom Kippur ceremony (Leviticus 16), the high priest cast lots over two goats – one to be the **sin offering** for the Lord, and one to be the **scapegoat** released alive【32†L70-L78】. Remarkably, Pilate unknowingly reenacted this ritual: he **presented two men** before the assembled people – Jesus and the criminal Barabbas – analogous to the two goats presented before God【32†L64-L72】. He then allowed the crowd (standing in for the lot) to choose which would live and which would die【32†L70-L78】. This is precisely parallel to *casting lots*. As one commentary notes, *“Pontius Pilate asks the crowd to make a decision of whom to release: Barabbas or Jesus,”* mirroring Leviticus 16:8【32†L70-L78】. Thus Pilate functioned as *High Priest* presiding over the atonement ritual, even though he was a Gentile authority. This role was foisted on him because the Jewish high priest Caiaphas had disqualified himself by tearing his robes during Jesus’ trial (an act forbidden to the High Priest – Lev 21:10)【2†L41-L48】. Pilate, representing the Roman “pontifex,” **unknowingly took the seat of the high priest** and “decided the fate of the ‘goats’”【32†L53-L60】. He even performed the priestly gesture of washing – *“washing his hands of the affair”* – which recalls the high priest’s washing rituals on Yom Kippur【32†L53-L60】【31†L7-L15】. In essence, Pilate cast the “lot” between Jesus and Barabbas, selecting one as a sacrifice and one as the scapegoat, just as the High Priest would【32†L67-L75】【32†L78-L86】.

**Pilate’s Reluctance – Like a High Priest’s Duty:** Pilate famously was reluctant to execute Jesus – declaring multiple times that he found *“no fault”* in Him and seeking to release Him (Luke 23:22; John 19:12). This reluctance aligns with the High Priest’s attitude toward the sacrifice: the sin-offering goat had to be **unblemished** and chosen with solemnity, not eagerness. Pilate treating Jesus as innocent corresponds to the priest examining the sacrificial animal for any blemish. In the ritual analogy, Pilate recognized Jesus as a righteous offering (hence his attempt to set Him free, akin to designating Him the scapegoat to *live*). His hesitation to crucify Jesus actually fulfills the **priestly function** – the High Priest on Yom Kippur would not want to kill needlessly; he followed God’s lot. So when the lot (the crowd’s choice) fell to Jesus to die, Pilate ceremonially washed his hands, declaring himself innocent of the blood (Matthew 27:24), much as the priests would cleanse themselves after handling the sacrifice【31†L13-L16】. Unwittingly, Pilate was ensuring the ritual purity of the process – just as the high priest had to remain clean. In fact, because the official High Priest (Caiaphas) had rendered himself unclean by tearing his clothes【2†L41-L48】, Pilate’s reluctance and hand-washing were crucial to maintain the **purity of the atonement ritual**. He even pronounced Jesus “King of the Jews” in a mocking tone, yet prophetically identifying Him as the **scapegoat leader** of the people bearing their guilt. All of this shows Pilate acting in the role of the priest who oversees the atoning sacrifice, albeit unknowingly but *under divine orchestration*.

**Hidden Identity – Jewish Leaders Unaware:** During the trial and execution process, the Jewish authorities stayed outside the Praetorium to avoid ritual defilement before the Passover feast【34†L11-L19】. Thus, they did not witness everything Pilate did *inside*. This detail is critical: it means the priests and elders would not know if a **substitution** took place in the governor’s headquarters. John 18:28 emphasizes they *“did not enter…the governor’s palace, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.”*【34†L11-L19】 In Yom Kippur terms, once the High Priest cast the lots and led the chosen scapegoat away, the people outside the Holy of Holies did not see the inner workings. Similarly, Pilate’s private dealings could have included arranging for Jesus to be set aside (as the scapegoat) and another to take His place for execution. Pilate’s own wife had warned him not to harm “that righteous man” (Matthew 27:19), reinforcing his desire to avoid actually killing Jesus. The Jewish leaders, in their zeal, assumed the one brought to crucifixion was Jesus, but **having refused to come inside**, they were *“unaware of the actual identity of the one crucified.”* In other words, the **scapegoat was kept out of their view**. The secrecy of removing Jesus aligns with Ezekiel’s vision of the prince escaping in darkness【30†L85-L93】. It is entirely possible that Pilate, after the brutal scourging (which took place inside the barracks out of public view), arranged for Jesus to be taken away (like the live goat “presented alive before the Lord”【32†L83-L86】) and delivered someone else to Golgotha. The chief priests and crowd, having demanded Jesus’ crucifixion, *thought* they saw it carried out, but in truth they “were made to think that they did” – a scenario eerily similar to what later Jewish and even Islamic tradition held (cf. Quran 4:157: *“they never killed him, they never crucified him – it was made to appear so to them”*【9†L73-L81】). The result: the religious leaders remained ritually pure for Passover yet ironically became **blind to the real atonement ritual** unfolding. Like those outside the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, they could only trust that the procedure inside was as they intended – not realizing God’s high priest (Pilate) had ensured the true *Son of Man* was spared, and a substitute was led out to Calvary. 

# Judas as the Sin Offering

**Judas’ Death as the Sin Offering:** According to the Mosaic law, the sin offering on the Day of Atonement had to be killed as a blood sacrifice for the people’s sins (Lev 16:9,15). In the Gospel narrative, **Judas Iscariot** – the betrayer – meets a death that fulfills the criteria of the cursed sin offering. After he betrayed Jesus, Judas was overcome with remorse and *“went and hanged himself”* (Matthew 27:5). This method of death — hanging from a tree — is highly significant. The Law states *“anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse”* (Deuteronomy 21:23), which the New Testament echoes in Galatians 3:13【36†L37-L45】. Judas literally hung on a tree, thus **becoming a curse**. One commentator notes that both Jesus and Judas ended up “cursed of God” by hanging on a tree, *“but for different reasons”*【36†L45-L53】. In God’s providence, however, Judas’s curse was the one **truly deserved** – he bore the guilt of his own heinous sin of betrayal, and symbolically, the guilt of Israel’s rejection of Messiah. Judas’s hanging can be seen as the **Sin Offering**: he died a death of blood guilt, spilling out (Acts 1:18 describes his body rupturing). Crucifixion itself was often termed “hanging on a tree” in Scripture (Acts 5:30, 10:39) – thus Judas’s hanging is equivalent to the cursed death of crucifixion. By *hanging himself*, Judas took on the role of the goat “for Yahweh” that is killed to atone for sin. He paid with his blood money and his life, satisfying the requirement that sin be paid for by death.

**Historical and Textual Support for Judas as the One Crucified:** While the canonical Gospels present Jesus as crucified, there are intriguing historical echoes of a **substitution theory** in early Christian and related traditions. Some Gnostic Christians in the 2nd century taught that Jesus did not die on the cross at all – that someone else was crucified in His place (in Basilides’ account, it was Simon of Cyrene who was mistakenly crucified【13†L83-L90】). Even more relevant is a medieval text known as the *Gospel of Barnabas*, which, though not canonical, preserves an ancient idea: it explicitly claims that Judas Iscariot was transformed to look like Jesus and was **crucified in Jesus’ stead**【11†L102-L110】. In that account, Judas is captured by the soldiers and crucified, crying out in Jesus’ words, “God, why have you forsaken me?” – because he realized the *“malefactor has escaped and I die unjustly”*【11†L102-L110】. This startling narrative, albeit apocryphal, shows that the concept of Judas dying in place of Jesus was known and believed by some. The Quran likewise says Jesus was not actually crucified, but it was made to appear so, without naming the substitute【9†L73-L81】 – many Muslim traditions independently conclude it was Judas who was crucified instead. These accounts reinforce that the idea of **substitution** at the crucifixion has a long history. Moreover, within the New Testament itself there are clues: Matthew’s Gospel emphasizes Judas’ death (Matt 27:3-10) right after Jesus is handed over, almost as if to draw attention to the *other* death occurring that day – the *blood money* Judas returns buys the “Field of Blood,” a permanent testament to the true blood that was spilled. The apostle Peter later alludes to Judas’ gruesome end, describing how “he fell headlong and burst open” in that field (Acts 1:18). These details about Judas’s death are unusual to include unless they bear theological weight: Judas died a cursed death on the same day as Jesus’ trial, satisfying the need for a **sin-bearer’s blood** to be shed. The timing and nature of his demise fit the profile of the Levitical sin offering – taken *“outside the camp”* and disposed of in dishonor (Lev 16:27). Judas, in essence, became the *“goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell”* to be sacrificed【32†L78-L86】. 

**Two Sacrifices – One Free, One for Sin:** The atonement ritual required **two** animals (Leviticus 16:5-10) – one to die and one to go free – because a single entity could not both die *and* carry sins away alive. This is a key point of Mosaic law: atonement was a *process* involving dual roles. Jesus and Judas together fulfill this requirement. Jesus corresponds to the **scapegoat** that is released alive, and Judas corresponds to the **sin offering** goat that is slain for the people. The crowd, influenced by the chief priests, chose Jesus to be handed over and effectively *chose Judas* (unknowingly) to bear the curse – the inverse of what they thought. Pilate’s “lot casting” between Jesus and Barabbas also incidentally cast Judas in the role of the sacrificed one. Notably, Barabbas (whose name ironically means “son of the father”) was the one actually freed in public【32†L78-L86】. But in the grander scheme, **Jesus** was the beloved Son who was freed *from death*, and Judas, the “son of perdition” (John 17:12), became the scapegoat *in the negative sense*, carrying guilt unto destruction. In God’s courtroom, *both* had to be offered. If Jesus alone had died and risen, the pattern of Leviticus 16 would not be literally fulfilled (the same person cannot both die and roam free). By orchestrating Judas’s betrayal and subsequent suicide, God provided the second sacrifice. Thus the two men – Jesus and Judas – form the dual sacrifice of the atonement ritual, **perfectly aligning with Moses’ law**. Jesus himself hinted at this necessity when He prayed, “Of those whom You gave me I have lost none, except the son of perdition, *that the Scripture might be fulfilled*” (John 17:12). Indeed, the Scripture of the atonement law was fulfilled: one (Judas) was lost (as a sin offering), so that the other (Jesus) might remain alive to carry away sin. Without Judas’s death, the atonement would have been ritually incomplete. His hanging provided the blood payment for sin, while Jesus’ living escape provided the removal of sin. This **twin sacrifice** is the true foundation of salvation in the biblical model, not a single victim doing both parts. As Leviticus says, one goat was *“for the Lord”* (blood atonement) and one *“for Azazel”* to carry sins away, and **both were required**【32†L64-L72】【32†L78-L86】. Judas and Jesus fulfilled each role, respectively, on the day of crucifixion.

# Peter’s Role and the Incomplete Ritual

**Peter as the Intended Burnt Offering:** In the Levitical system, after the sin offering and scapegoat rites, the High Priest would offer **burnt offerings** to conclude the atonement ceremony (Lev 16:24). The burnt offering symbolized total devotion and purification – the entire animal consumed by fire for God. In the unfolding of Jesus’ atonement ritual, the apostle **Peter** was positioned to fulfill a similar role. Peter had declared himself ready to die with Jesus: *“Even if I have to die with You, I will never disown You”* (Mark 14:31). This zealous vow suggests Peter was willing to be **offered up**, figuratively as a whole burnt offering in service of his Lord. As one of Jesus’ closest disciples and a representative of the **priestly** community Jesus was forming, Peter’s sacrifice of himself would have signified the complete dedication (like a burnt offering) of the new priesthood (the apostles) to God’s plan. In a sense, if Judas was the sin offering and Jesus the scapegoat, Peter was to be the *burnt offering* that accompanies and completes the atonement process – a willing martyrdom sealing the covenant. We see a hint of this in that Jesus gave Simon the name “Peter” and said on this rock He would build His church (Matt 16:18). Peter was meant to be a foundation stone, a **living sacrifice** (cf. Romans 12:1) in the new order. However, when the crucial moment came, Peter’s courage failed. Instead of following Jesus to the end, Peter **denied** Him three times that night, fulfilling Jesus’ prediction (Luke 22:61-62). Thus, Peter *withdrew* his offer to die alongside his Master. The “burnt offering” was left unmade. In Levitical terms, it was as if the final sacrifice on the Day of Atonement altar was interrupted, leaving the ritual **incomplete**. Peter’s intended role did not materialize at that time – he fled, surviving the night when he initially was willing to be consumed. 

**An Unclean Priesthood – Peter’s Failure Opens the Door:** The consequence of Peter’s failed offering was that the emerging priesthood (the apostles) was left in a state of ceremonial **uncleanness**. On the Day of Atonement, the High Priest had to be thoroughly cleansed and anointed, and all steps followed meticulously, for Israel’s sin to be fully removed. By denying Jesus, Peter – who would later lead the Jerusalem church – sinned and metaphorically **soiled his garments** at the very climax of the ritual. It’s telling that after the denial, Peter “wept bitterly” (Matt 26:75), indicating profound remorse but not immediate restoration. The priestly band of disciples was disoriented and fearful after Jesus’ arrest; their spiritual “cleansing” was put on hold until after the resurrection appearances when Jesus rehabilitated Peter (John 21:17). In the interim, this lapse left a **vacuum** – an opportunity for corruption and falsehood to creep in before the Church fully grasped the completed atonement. In other words, because the figurative *burnt offering* of total devotion wasn’t completed that night, the full protective grace over the nascent Church’s leadership had a breach. Into that breach stepped **Paul** (Saul of Tarsus) soon after – a zealous Pharisee who claimed a special apostleship. Peter and the others eventually believed Jesus was risen, but they were still grappling with what it all meant. Their momentary failure made them vulnerable. It is in this context that **Paul’s deception found entry**. If the original apostles had all stood firm (as a united burnt offering of faithfulness, even unto death), perhaps the clarity of Jesus’ atonement work would have remained front-and-center. Instead, Peter’s denial and the others fleeing (Mark 14:50) meant the early community needed restoration and gave an opening for an outsider to come in with a *different interpretation*. Essentially, the priesthood was not yet fully *consecrated* when Paul appeared on the scene with his own agenda.

**“The Gates of Hell Shall Not Prevail”: Corruption Foretold but Limited:** Jesus, foreseeing the coming turmoil, had already given an assurance to Peter and the church in embryonic form: *“on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”* (Matt 16:18). This statement implies that the forces of darkness (evil, deceit, even death itself) would assault the Church, but not ultimately triumph. By invoking “the gates of Hades,” Jesus hinted that there would be a period when it *seemed* hell was overcoming – a direct reference to the kind of corruption and false teaching that did in fact infiltrate after His departure. The phrase “not prevail” indicates a struggle: falsehood and corruption (the realm of Satan) would attack the foundation (even using one of the foundational figures, Peter, who momentarily became a “stumbling block” when Jesus said “Get behind me, Satan” in Matthew 16:23). After Jesus ascended, the **enemy struck** by exploiting human weakness – Peter’s denial had been one instance, and later Peter’s fear of the Judaizers was another (Galatians 2:11-14). But Jesus’ promise guaranteed that however powerful these “gates of hell” seemed, they would *not overcome* the true Church. The early corruption came primarily through one man – Paul – who introduced a divergent theology (as we will see). Yet Jesus had prayed for Peter specifically that his faith would not fail completely and that he would strengthen his brothers (Luke 22:32). Peter’s eventual repentance and martyrdom (church tradition says he was later crucified upside down) suggest that he *did* complete his “burnt offering” in the end – but only after initially faltering. Thus, the atonement ritual was left **temporarily incomplete**, allowing Paul’s teachings to gain a foothold, but Jesus had already set limits by His prophetic word. The true priesthood, though delayed in its cleansing, would rise again to expose deception. *“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you all like wheat, but I have prayed for you…”* (Luke 22:31-32) – indeed the sifting occurred (through fear, denial, and false teachings entering), yet because of Christ’s intercession, the **priestly foundation was not destroyed**. The “rock” (Peter’s confession of Messiah and ultimately his loyalty) would endure and, in time, overcome the lies that crept in. Jesus’ mention of the church prevailing implies He anticipated the corruption (the satanic assault through lies and half-truths) but guaranteed that it would *ultimately* be overcome, even if for a time it caused great confusion.

# Paul as the Stumbling Block

**Paul’s Self-Awareness as a Tester of Israel:** The apostle Paul (formerly Saul) enters the scene a few years after Jesus’ atonement, claiming a special revelation of Christ. By his own admission, Paul took a radically different approach to the Gospel, especially regarding the Law of Moses. He wrote, *“To the Jews I became as a Jew, to those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law)…to those without the law I became as one without the law”* (1 Cor 9:20-21). Such statements show Paul’s chameleon-like strategy – a **conscious adaptation** that can be seen as a testing of his audience. It’s as if Paul knew he was an instrument to *sort out* who truly understood God’s ways. In fact, Scripture contains the principle that God may send a **tester or stumbling block** to His people to see if they will remain true (e.g. Deuteronomy 13:3, where false prophets are a test of Israel’s love for God). Paul almost acknowledges this dynamic: *“there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine may be recognized”* (1 Cor 11:19). This cryptic remark suggests Paul understood that **division and controversy** (much of which his own teaching sparked) would ultimately reveal who had God’s approval. It is not far-fetched to see Paul as akin to those figures in the Old Testament whom God allowed to arise to test the people – like the false prophets in Ezekiel’s time. Ezekiel warned of deceivers: *“They have seduced My people, saying ‘Peace!’ when there is no peace”* (Ezk 13:10). Paul’s gospel of “free grace” apart from the Law sounded like a message of peace and liberty to those burdened by the law, possibly **seducing many** who didn’t know the full implications. Paul even describes his ministry in terms that evoke a testing role: he speaks of God “sending a powerful delusion” so that those who refuse to love the truth will believe a lie (2 Thess 2:11) – ironically, a letter written by Paul himself. It is almost as if Paul subconsciously knew **his message** would separate those who truly adhered to Moses’ Law from those who would follow a new doctrine. Throughout his letters, Paul shows an acute awareness that his teachings were controversial and would cause some to stumble. He calls himself an apostle “untimely born” and “the least of the apostles” (1 Cor 15:8-9), and in another place he even suggests, *“If what I do causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat”* (1 Cor 8:13) – yet his entire ministry became a stumbling block to the Jews. This self-awareness aligns with the idea that Paul served as a **divinely permitted test** for Israel and the early believers: would they hold to the authentic atonement pattern delivered by Jesus (the law-fulfilling sacrifice), or be swayed by a new interpretation?

**Misleading the Law-Ignorant with a New Doctrine:** Paul’s preaching found its strongest reception among Gentiles and Hellenistic Jews who were **ignorant of Moses’ Law**. In fact, wherever Paul went, the observant Jews of the synagogues often rejected his message, while God-fearing Gentiles embraced it (Acts 13:45-48). Paul presented a doctrine centered not on the atonement law of Moses, but on **faith in the resurrection of Jesus** as the means of salvation. He downplayed or outright rejected the requirements of the Torah for justification, teaching that *“Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes”* (Rom 10:4) and that rituals like circumcision were unnecessary for Gentile converts. This was a dramatic reinterpretation – effectively a new religion that set aside the detailed atonement system God gave Israel. Many early believers in Jerusalem (who were “zealous for the Law” – Acts 21:20) were alarmed at this. They heard that Paul taught Jews “to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs” (Acts 21:21). Paul’s influence spread largely among those who did not have a strong grounding in the Law; they were attracted by the simplicity of a resurrection gospel and freedom from Jewish regulations. Thus, **Paul misled countless non-Jews (and even some Jews) into a law-free doctrine** that would have been foreign to Jesus’ original disciples. Jesus had said, *“salvation is of the Jews”* (John 4:22) and upheld the Law (Matt 5:17-19). Yet Paul’s doctrine made salvation a matter of belief in Jesus’ death and resurrection, largely **detached from Torah observance**. He recast Jesus primarily as a risen savior who offers personal salvation, rather than the atoning High Priest who fulfilled the Yom Kippur requirements of the covenant. This shift from a law-grounded atonement to a resurrection-centric faith was a clever deception for those not versed in Mosaic law. It replaced the concrete framework God provided (priesthood, sacrifices, Day of Atonement) with a more nebulous “faith alone” concept. Paul even admits employing guile: *“I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some”* (1 Cor 9:22). Unfortunately, in doing so, he **led many away** from the original context of Jesus’ mission. The result was a large contingent of believers who knew little of the Law and were content with Paul’s **easier Gospel** – one that didn’t require adherence to commandments or the Jewish way of life. This was exactly the scenario Ezekiel and other prophets warned about: leaders who would “lead My people astray, saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace” (Ezk 13:10), offering a false sense of security. Paul told people they could have *peace with God* (Rom 5:1) simply by faith, outside the law – a teaching that *misled* those who were ignorant that according to God’s covenant, **atonement requires lawful sacrifice and priestly mediation**. 

**Ezekiel’s Warnings and Paul’s Leadership:** Ezekiel 34 rebukes the self-serving shepherds of Israel: *“Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?”* (Ezk 34:2)【39†L9-L17】. Paul’s career, despite his noble claims, can be seen in this light. He often defended his authority and boasted of his labor, but his actions led to confusion and division (as seen in the factions at Corinth calling themselves after Paul, Apollos, etc.). He collected money from Gentile churches ostensibly for the poor in Jerusalem, but also to cement his leadership (Romans 15:25-27, 2 Cor 9). Some accused him of being a false apostle even in his time (2 Cor 11:4-5,13). Jesus Himself had prophesied, “false christs and false prophets will arise and deceive many” (Matt 24:24). While Paul is not a *false messiah*, he can be viewed as a **false prophet/leader** who came in sheep’s clothing. He claimed to speak for Jesus, but introduced doctrines that Jesus never taught. Notably, in Revelation 2:2 the church in Ephesus is praised for testing “those who claim to be apostles but are not, and finding them false.” Paul had a long association with Ephesus; some scholars believe this could be a subtle reference to testing Paul’s teachings. Indeed, late in Paul’s life he laments, “all who are in Asia have turned away from me” (2 Tim 1:15) – Asia (Minor) included Ephesus. This suggests that eventually many believers **saw through Paul’s errors** and rejected his leadership, aligning with Jesus’ commendation of those who tested false apostles. Paul’s actions – abolishing distinctions between clean and unclean, dismissing the dietary laws, and redefining circumcision – match what Ezekiel and other prophets would call **unfaithfulness**. Ezekiel 22:26 says Israel’s leaders “have violated My law and profaned My holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common, they teach there is no difference between the unclean and clean.” Paul did exactly that by teaching the food laws and circumcision were no longer relevant. In doing so, he became a **stumbling block** to Israel: his version of the gospel made it even harder for Jews to accept Jesus as Messiah, because it appeared to be a lawless, Gentile religion. Paul even admits that his preaching of “Christ crucified” was *“a stumbling block to Jews”* (1 Cor 1:23). The irony is profound – the very thing he preached (a crucified/resurrected Messiah without the Law) became a trap that kept many Jews from the true Messianic message. Thus, Paul fulfills the role of the divinely allowed *stumbling block* or “testing stone.” Those who truly understood Moses would see the inconsistency in Paul’s doctrine and hold to the truth; those who didn’t, would **stumble into error**, as many did. It is a sobering fulfillment of Ezekiel’s warnings about leaders who **mislead the flock** for their own ends, and a parallel to how Balaam enticed Israel into sin (Rev 2:14) – Balaam being a prototype of false teacher for gain, much as some could accuse Paul (who frequently had to deny charges of seeking profit or pleasure, see 1 Thess 2:5, 1 Cor 9:4-18). In short, Paul represents the prophesied dynamic where God allows a persuasive but misleading figure to sift His people, separating true adherence to the covenant from superficial faith.

# Substitution vs. Resurrection

**Jesus Not Resurrected but Substituted (Mosaic Law Fulfilled):** A central argument emerges from **Moses’ atonement law**: forgiveness of sin is achieved by the *substitutionary death* of an innocent and the removal of guilt by a scapegoat. There is **no provision in the Law for a resurrection to atone for sin**. The sacrificial system is predicated on *life for life* (Leviticus 17:11) – the blood of the sacrifice makes atonement. Jesus’ mission, understood in light of Torah, was to fulfill these requirements exactly, not to introduce a brand-new paradigm. Thus, Jesus orchestrated a substitution: He, the innocent one, would not be killed (so that He could continue as our High Priest and scapegoat), while a **proxy** (Judas, the guilty one) would die carrying the curse. In doing so, Jesus fulfilled the **letter of Moses’ law**: the sin offering was made (Judas died under the curse), and the scapegoat was sent away alive (Jesus survived, bearing away the sins of those who believed). This means that Jesus did **not need to be resurrected** from death, because He never remained in death – He was *spared* from it by divine plan. What happened on the third day was not a resurrection from literal death, but the **re-emergence** of the living Jesus who had been hidden. The empty tomb was real, but it was empty because Jesus’ body had never decayed; it was preserved by the fact that He was the scapegoat, led “into the wilderness” (in this case, the grave/tomb and beyond) but not slain. Many of Jesus’ post-crucifixion appearances could thus be seen not as a ghost or merely spiritual resurrection, but as the same physical Jesus showing Himself alive (Acts 1:3) because He indeed remained alive. Moses’ law would have been **broken** if the intended sin-bearer (Jesus) had been killed – for then who would carry the sins away? The scapegoat had to be *alive* to carry sins “to an uninhabited land”【7†L209-L217】【7†L227-L234】. By ensuring a substitute death, God honored the law’s requirement of a death for sin while also fulfilling the type of the scapegoat through Jesus’ continued life. This is a biblically sound reading: Isaiah 53, in a heavily prophetic way, says the servant *“was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people”*, yet also *“prolong his days”* after making his soul an offering (Isa 53:8,10). How can both be true? The answer: **substitution**. Jesus “died” as the sacrificial offering in a figurative or legal sense (bearing sin’s cost), but another took the literal execution, allowing Jesus to have his days prolonged (living on to continue God’s work). In sum, according to Moses’ law, the mechanism of salvation is substitutionary atonement, not a resurrected deity. Jesus fulfilled this by a perfectly orchestrated switch, **satisfying the Law on every point** without needing to violate the natural order by reversing death. His atonement was legal and prophetic, not merely spectacle.

**Paul’s Resurrection-Centered Doctrine – A Distortion:** Paul, however, shifted the focus dramatically. He built a doctrine in which **resurrection** was everything – “If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins” he declares【23†L15-L23】. According to Paul, the resurrection of Jesus was the proof of atonement accomplished, even the means of our justification (Romans 4:25). But this emphasis **contradicts the Mosaic atonement principles**. Nowhere did Moses teach that a sacrifice must rise again for it to count. On the contrary, atonement was accomplished by the shedding of blood and the scapegoat’s removal of sins. By insisting that Jesus had to **literally die and then resurrect** to save us, Paul essentially sidelined the actual atoning act (the shedding of blood by the sin offering). He turned the Gospel into one of victory over death, rather than remission of sins through lawful sacrifice. This appealed to Gentiles steeped in mystery religions that celebrated dying-and-rising gods, but it muddled the very concrete, law-based foundation of how God deals with sin. Paul’s preaching in Athens was summarized as *“He was preaching Jesus and the Resurrection”* (Acts 17:18), which listeners even mistook as two deities! The point: Paul’s message revolved around resurrection power more than Yom Kippur substitution. In doing so, he **obscured the true meaning** of Jesus’ work as our High Priest performing atonement. He taught that Jesus “abolished the law of commandments” (Eph 2:15) by His death, and that righteousness comes apart from the law (Rom 3:21-22). This directly opposes the notion that Jesus was fulfilling the law’s requirements (Matt 5:17). Essentially, Paul spiritualized and universalized salvation in a way that no longer depended on the Israelite priestly system. This doctrinal shift allowed non-Jews to bypass the law entirely – but at the cost of **misrepresenting the method** God chose (the atonement ritual). By hinging everything on resurrection, Paul made the physical event of Jesus rising the object of faith, rather than the **completed sacrifice** according to Torah. It’s noteworthy that the Gospels themselves emphasize Jesus’ death as the atoning sacrifice (e.g. “this is my blood of the covenant, shed for many for forgiveness of sins” – Matt 26:28) and treat the resurrection as a vindication and sign. Paul took it further to be the core of the saving act. This was a distortion that later theology ran with, often to the point of neglecting the Old Testament sacrificial framework entirely. As a result, many came to believe a version of salvation that no longer mirrored the divinely ordained pattern given to Israel, effectively **disconnecting the Gospel from its Hebraic roots**.

**The Scapegoat Must Remain Unharmed – Debunking a Bloody Crucifixion of Jesus:** Under the Mosaic law, the scapegoat was **never harmed** or killed during the ceremony. Leviticus 16:10 is explicit that the second goat is presented alive and sent into the wilderness *“to make atonement by sending it away”*【7†L209-L217】. If Jesus was the ultimate scapegoat carrying our sins, He by necessity had to **remain unharmed in the atonement act**, otherwise the type would break. This underscores that the traditional image of Jesus being brutally killed as the sin-bearer actually conflates the two roles (sacrifice and scapegoat) in a way the law does not permit for one entity. Jesus endured suffering (just as the scapegoat bore the weight of Israel’s sins symbolically), but the **actual death for sin was borne by another** (Judas, the sin offering). Jesus had to be **free of injury unto death** to fully carry the sins away. Any significant physical harm to the scapegoat would invalidate it – thus Jesus, after the ordeal, showed that not a bone of Him was broken (John 19:36), and He emerged alive. This is further evidence that God did not allow His Holy One to see corruption or be shattered by death (Psalm 16:10). The crucifixion as commonly understood – Jesus nailed and killed – would mean Jesus was both goats at once, something that Leviticus’ ritual structure would contradict (one goat cannot both die and live). Instead, a **lawful reading** is that Jesus, as the scapegoat, endured mockery, carried the “wood” of the cross as if bearing sins, but ultimately was removed from the final sacrifice moment, in order to remain alive and take those sins figuratively “outside the camp” (Hebrews 13:12-13). Judas, the true sin offering, died in a manner paralleling crucifixion (hung on a tree)【36†L45-L53】, taking the curse and wrath. Therefore, when we understand Jesus’ role as scapegoat, the idea of Him being *physically crucified to death* becomes unnecessary and even counter to the typology. The **traditional crucifixion narrative** (as literalized by later Christian doctrine) is thus debunked by the requirements of the atonement law: the scapegoat Messiah could not be the one slaughtered. He had to be **uncharmed in terms of life** – though burdened with sin – so that He could complete the atonement by **exiting the stage alive**. And that is exactly what He did, appearing later to prove God had accepted the atonement. Paul’s failure or refusal to teach this nuance led to generations misunderstanding Jesus as *only* the slain sacrifice, when in truth Jesus’ main role was the **living carrier of sin (the scapegoat)**, and the sacrificial lamb role was fulfilled by another. By refocusing on the law’s actual procedure, we clarify that salvation was accomplished by **substitution**, not by violating death and returning from it. Jesus did not need to “defeat death” in a dramatic resurrection because the plan was never for Him to be held by death – He was **to avoid death entirely** (like Isaac was spared on the altar, with the ram provided as substitute). In this light, Paul’s resurrection-centric gospel is exposed as a departure from the concrete, lawful salvation God set up. The true triumph was not in a resurrection spectacle, but in the **flawless execution of the atonement ritual**: a substitute died under God’s curse and the chosen one lived on, ensuring both blood atonement and removal of sin. This is biblically sound and firmly rooted in Moses’ law, once we see past the later reinterpretation.

# Final Reckoning and Eschatology

**The Deception of Paul and End-Times Unveiling:** The Scriptures indicate that in the last days, God will bring everything to light – including the hidden truths of what happened in Jesus’ passion. What Paul introduced as a “mystery” (his word for previously hidden truth) actually became a **mystery of lawlessness** working in the church (cf. 2 Thess 2:7). Paul himself wrote that *“the mystery of lawlessness is already at work”* (2 Thess 2:7), perhaps without realizing how he was contributing to it by setting aside the law. This “mystery of lawlessness” corresponds to a great deception that would pervade the Christian age – a deception that obscured the true atonement (law-based substitution) and replaced it with a lawless doctrine (resurrection without Torah). But prophecy says there will be a final **awakening**. Just as Ezekiel’s prophecies often end with the refrain *“then they shall know that I am the LORD”* when the truth comes out, so in the end times, Israel and the world will come to know the truth about Jesus’ atonement. The Book of Revelation speaks of an end-time unveiling (the word “Revelation” itself means unveiling). Revelation denounces a “false prophet” who deceived the world with miracles in support of a false system (Rev 19:20)【41†L1-L8】. Many see this false prophet as a future figure, but in principle it can apply to any major religious deceiver. Paul’s **miracle-working ministry** (Rom 15:19, Acts 19:11-12) and his influence over the masses in establishing a new doctrine eerily prefigure the work of the false prophet who leads people astray from God’s commandments. In the end, Revelation says this false prophet will be exposed and judged (Rev 19:20)【41†L1-L8】. Similarly, Paul’s teachings – which have dominated Christian thought – will be **exposed in the light of God’s word**. The “man of iniquity (lawlessness)” that Paul describes in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 can be viewed as not just a single individual at the end, but a *succession or spirit* of lawlessness that set itself up in God’s temple (the church) and claimed authority. Paul’s doctrine, by casting aside the law, enthroned itself in the Church (God’s spiritual temple) and essentially proclaimed a new way to God, a bold move that could be seen as *“exalting himself against everything called God”* (2 Thess 2:4) – since God’s Law is an expression of His authority. The **final reckoning** will involve stripping away these pretensions. As Paul wrote, the Lord will *“destroy [the lawless one] with the brightness of His coming”* (2 Thess 2:8). When Christ returns, the brightness of Truth will burn away the lies. The world will realize that much of what they followed (via Paul’s version of Christianity) was a mélange of truth and error – a strong delusion allowed by God (2 Thess 2:11) for a time, to test hearts. 

**Ezekiel, Daniel, Revelation – Converging Prophecies:** The prophet Daniel foresaw an end-time when knowledge shall increase and the wise will understand (Dan 12:4,10). This implies that at the time of the end, hidden knowledge – such as the real story of the atonement – will be understood by a remnant of wise believers. Daniel also speaks of a corrupting influence that would *“change times and law”* (Dan 7:25) and wear out the saints. Paul’s doctrine effectively “changed the law” by teaching it was obsolete, and through history this led to changing holy times (the Sabbath to Sunday, Passover to Easter, etc., largely under Pauline-influenced Christianity). But Daniel says the court of God will sit and remove that power, restoring truth. Likewise, Ezekiel’s vision of the dry bones (Ezk 37) can be seen as Israel’s spiritual revival – in the last days, Israel (and those grafted into Israel) will have the breath of God’s truth breathed into them, and they will **stand up in realization** of what really transpired with their Messiah. Zechariah 12:10 prophesies that Israel will *“look on Me whom they have pierced, and mourn for him as an only son.”* Traditionally this is taken as recognizing Jesus whom they crucified. But in our context, it could mean they will realize the **true tragedy** – that their Messiah was rejected, a righteous one was pierced in subterfuge, and that they had been misled about it for millennia. There will be deep repentance as the veil is lifted. Revelation 11 speaks of two witnesses and a great earthquake that shakes the city – symbolically, a shaking of the established religious order and a testimony that cannot be silenced. This could well include testimony to the true atonement arrangement which will shock the world. *“Babylon the great”* (false religious system) falls in Revelation 18, and a voice says *“Come out of her, my people”*. Many interpret “Babylon” as corrupt Christianity that mixed truth with paganism – largely a result of Paul’s Hellenized gospel. In the end, God’s people are called out of that confusion, which certainly entails abandoning the Pauline distortions and returning to the pure understanding of Messiah’s fulfillment of the Law.

**Paul as the Man of Lawlessness and False Prophet:** While it is uncomfortable for many to equate Paul with these end-time villains, the **parallels are striking** when viewed through the lens of Torah-faithfulness. The “man of lawlessness” in 2 Thessalonians exalts himself in God’s temple. Paul famously confronted Peter and the Jerusalem apostles, effectively asserting his own authority and gospel as above theirs (see Galatians 2:6-11). He said “I am not inferior to the most eminent apostles” (2 Cor 11:5) and even if an angel taught differently than him, let that angel be accursed (Gal 1:8) – a remarkably bold self-exaltation. Moreover, “lawlessness” (Greek *anomia*) literally means **negation of the law** – precisely what Paul’s doctrine did by declaring the law null for believers. In this sense, *Paul embodies the spirit of the man of lawlessness*, and his influence over the church age is the mystery of lawlessness at work. Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians in part to divert suspicion, but prophecy often has layers beyond the human author’s intent. Similarly, the “false prophet” of Revelation does miracles and leads people to worship the Beast. If the Beast is seen as imperial, lawless Christianity or Roman state religion, Paul’s teachings did later dovetail with Roman power, and his epistles were used to give theological cover to a Gentile church empire that often persecuted the faithful (the Inquisitions, etc., were justified by misusing Pauline concepts). Thus, Paul’s legacy is very much tied into the **prophetic archetype** of the false prophet. He had *“two horns like a lamb”* perhaps – appearing as a lamb (Christian) but speaking like a dragon (mixing truth with satanic lie). Importantly, Revelation 19:20 says the false prophet was captured *“who had performed signs on his behalf (the Beast) and deceived those who had received the mark”*【41†L1-L8】. In the end times, those deceived might not be literal mark-bearers only, but all who accepted a counterfeit theology (a “mark” on mind and hand symbolizing thoughts and deeds). Paul’s teachings encouraged a break from Torah (forehead and hand symbolism in Deut 6:8 for keeping the law was replaced by many with the mark of lawlessness in their beliefs and actions). But God will not leave His people in deception. **All that was hidden will be revealed** (Luke 8:17). This includes the real events of Calvary and the role of figures like Paul. Just as Joseph eventually revealed himself to his brothers who once misunderstood him, Jesus will reveal how He orchestrated salvation – and how another came in and distorted the narrative.

**The Awakening of Israel to the Truth:** Finally, the prophecies indicate Israel (ethnic and spiritual) will awaken to the Messiah in truth. Romans 11:25-26 (ironically written by Paul) says a blindness happened in part to Israel until the fullness of Gentiles comes in, and then “all Israel will be saved.” That blindness can be seen as partly the result of Paul’s gentile-focused gospel eclipsing the Jewish understanding. But when the “times of Gentiles” end, that veil is lifted. The Jewish people will realize that Jesus of Nazareth truly fulfilled the atonement **according to their own Scriptures**, not according to the distorted version they heard. They will see that He did not abolish the law – He fulfilled it to the letter, accomplishing redemption through the very pattern of Yom Kippur. They will understand that the stumbling block was not Jesus, but the false presentation of Jesus (either as a false messiah in Judaism’s view or as a lawless dying-and-rising god in much of Christianity’s view). In Zechariah 8:23 it says in those days ten men from the nations will take hold of a Jew saying, “God is with you, let us go with you.” This implies Gentiles will finally grasp the Jewish roots of salvation and seek guidance from faithful Israel. The final awakening involves repudiating the lies of “Babylon” and Paul’s misinterpretations, and embracing the Messiah in the way He intended – as the Atonement High Priest who performed all things in obedience to the Father’s law. When this happens, the decades of confusion sown by the “stumbling block” of Pauline doctrine will be cleared. Ezekiel’s vision of the stick of Judah and stick of Joseph (Ezk 37:16-19) becoming one can symbolize the reunification of the divided understandings – the Jewish believers and gentile believers coming together in one truth. There will no longer be a Pauline Gentile church versus a Torah-faithful remnant; they will be one in Messiah, understanding the whole truth. 

In the end, **truth prevails**. Jesus promised that the gates of hell would not prevail against His assembly – meaning all the falsehood and deception that issued forth (even from within) would not ultimately defeat His purpose. The final generation will see through the grand delusion. The man of lawlessness (and all that spirit of error embodied by Paul’s legacy) will be exposed and removed by the Lord’s breath【40†L33-L37】. The false prophet’s doctrines will be cast into the fire of God’s judgment【41†L1-L8】. The stage will be set for the true Kingdom, where Messiah is understood and worshiped for who He is: not a abolitionist of the law or merely a resurrected wonder-worker, but **the Son of Man, our High Priest, who offered the required sacrifices – using Judas as the sin offering and Himself as the scapegoat – and kept Himself undefiled, thus reconciling Israel to God**. This deep truth, once seen, will ignite repentance and faith like never before. As the prophecies say, *“Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame”* (Isa 49:23). The long wait for understanding will be over, and Israel will finally perceive how brilliantly God fulfilled the atonement right under the nose of His enemies. **Scripture will harmonize** – the Torah, the Prophets, and the New Covenant – once Paul’s stumbling block is removed and Ezekiel’s blueprint is acknowledged as the framework Messiah followed. This revelation is part of the final redemptive act of God, preparing a purified people who “keep the commandments of God *and* hold to the testimony of Jesus” (Rev 14:12) – something Paul’s doctrine had long separated, but which God will reunite in truth. 

In conclusion, the events of Jesus’ atonement ritual become clear when viewed through Ezekiel’s prophetic lens and the Torah’s requirements: Jesus, the Son of Man, enacted Ezekiel 12’s sign by escaping death (the prince through the wall) while a substitute bore the curse; Pilate unwittingly served as high priest, casting the lots between the two sacrificial figures; Judas’ tragic death fulfilled the sin-offering, providing the blood of atonement; Peter’s initial failure left room for a deceptive gospel to spread, as Paul became a test of the church’s fidelity to the law; Paul’s resurrection-centered, law-negating message was the foretold stumbling block that misled many, but itself was foreseen to be temporary; and finally, God’s prophetic word guarantees that all deception will be swept away as the faithful remnant embrace the full, lawful truth of Messiah’s sacrifice. This interpretation is not mere speculation but arises from a careful synthesis of **textual evidence and prophetic fulfillment** woven throughout Scripture – from Moses to Ezekiel, from the Gospels to Revelation – revealing a consistent narrative of atonement by substitution and a call to discernment against false redefinitions of salvation. All glory to the Holy One of Israel who, in His wisdom, *“declared the end from the beginning”* and will vindicate His truth in the sight of all. 【16†L117-L125】【32†L53-L60】【11†L102-L110】
