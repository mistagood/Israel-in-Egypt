How many of our 12 (13) constellations have female zodiacal characters traditionally associated with them

Traditionally, in the Greco-Roman zodiac (the system that defines the 12 signs, plus the 13th *Ophiuchus*), only **three** constellations are explicitly female in character. However, if you include mythic associations and variants, you can stretch that to **four**. Let’s go through them:

**1. Virgo — “the Maiden”**  
Unambiguously female. Usually identified with Dike (Justice), Astraea (the last immortal to live among humans), or Demeter’s daughter Persephone. The only one in the zodiac named for a woman outright.

**2. Libra — “the Scales”**  
Technically inanimate, but mythologically the scales belong to Astraea/Virgo. In older traditions, Virgo and Libra were one figure: the Virgin holding the scales. So Libra is a *partial* feminine derivative.

**3. Aquarius — “the Water-Bearer”**  
Nominally male (Ganymede), but in Mesopotamian and Egyptian origins the water-pouring figure was often a goddess—e.g. the Sumerian Ea’s consort Damkina or the Egyptian goddesses pouring life-waters. So it once had feminine aspects before the Greek recast it male.

**4. Pisces — “the Fishes”**  
The fish pair represent Aphrodite and her son Eros transformed to escape the monster Typhon. So half of this duo (Aphrodite) is female. Pisces thus encodes a *maternal* feminine component within a mixed pair.

All others—Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Scorpio, and Ophiuchus—are traditionally masculine or gender-neutral animals/figures (bull, twins, crab, lion, centaur, sea-goat, scorpion, serpent-bearer).

So, by strict Greek classical interpretation:
- **1 clearly female (Virgo)**  
- **3 with female connection (Virgo, Libra, Pisces)**  
- **4 if including early or alternate feminine traditions (Virgo, Libra, Pisces, Aquarius)**  

This means that roughly **a quarter to a third of the zodiac’s characters are feminine**—a minority, but notably clustered around the late-summer to early-spring arc of the sky.

Well, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the known constellations. I ain't talking about ancient things. I'm talking about which of them has a figure that's a woman. That's not an animal, but a woman. Not something turned into a fish, not something inanimate, but an actual woman. As it's known popular symbol.

If you mean *as they are depicted now*—the modern, recognized constellations of the zodiac and Ophiuchus, not ancient prototypes or symbolic mergers—then only **one** constellation is unambiguously represented as a woman:  

**Virgo.**

All others are either male, animal, hybrid, or object. Here’s the full set in modern astronomical and popular zodiacal imagery:

1. **Aries** – male ram  
2. **Taurus** – male bull  
3. **Gemini** – twin *men* (Castor and Pollux)  
4. **Cancer** – crab  
5. **Leo** – lion  
6. **Virgo** – *woman (the maiden)*  
7. **Libra** – scales (object)  
8. **Scorpio** – scorpion  
9. **Sagittarius** – centaur (male)  
10. **Capricorn** – sea-goat (male hybrid)  
11. **Aquarius** – man pouring water  
12. **Pisces** – two fish  
13. **Ophiuchus** – man holding a serpent  

So, in the officially recognized zodiac plus Ophiuchus, only **Virgo** is a human *woman*.  
Every other humanoid figure is male, and the rest are animals or symbols.  

In short: **1 out of 13** constellations—**Virgo**—is female in its popular, visual, and astronomical identity.
