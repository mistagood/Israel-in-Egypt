Here are the **actual astronomical dates** when the Sun passes through each of the **13 constellations** along the **true ecliptic path** (as observed from Earth), not the idealized astrological system. These are based on the current epoch (≈ 2025 CE) and can drift slightly over centuries due to precession.  

| # | Constellation | Hebrew Name (Mazzaroth) | Approx. Dates (Sun within constellation) |
|---|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Aries** | **Tleh (טָלֶה)** | **Apr 19 – May 13** |
| 2 | **Taurus** | **Shor (שׁוֹר)** | **May 14 – Jun 19** |
| 3 | **Gemini** | **Te’omim (תְּאוֹמִים)** | **Jun 20 – Jul 20** |
| 4 | **Cancer** | **Sartan (סָרְטָן)** | **Jul 21 – Aug 10** |
| 5 | **Leo** | **Ari / Aryeh (אַרְיהֵ)** | **Aug 11 – Sep 16** |
| 6 | **Virgo** | **Betulah (בְּתוּלָה)** | **Sep 17 – Oct 30** |
| 7 | **Libra** | **Moznayim (מאֹזְניַםִ)** | **Oct 31 – Nov 22** |
| 8 | **Scorpius** | **Akrav (עַקְרָב)** | **Nov 23 – Nov 29** |
| 9 | **Ophiuchus** | **Ish ha-Nachash (אִישׁ הַנָּחָשׁ)** | **Nov 30 – Dec 17** |
| 10 | **Sagittarius** | **Keshet (קֶשֶׁת)** | **Dec 18 – Jan 18** |
| 11 | **Capricornus** | **Gedi (גְּדִי)** | **Jan 19 – Feb 15** |
| 12 | **Aquarius** | **D’li (דְּלִי)** | **Feb 16 – Mar 11** |
| 13 | **Pisces** | **Dagim (דָּגִים)** | **Mar 12 – Apr 18** |

A few key notes to grasp the celestial layout:

- The Sun’s path (the **ecliptic**) is a narrow band of sky about 8° wide where these constellations lie.  
- **Ophiuchus** (Ish ha-Nachash) uniquely overlaps the ecliptic between Scorpius and Sagittarius, which is why it’s sometimes excluded from traditional 12-sign astrology even though the Sun clearly passes through it for ~18 days.  
- **Scorpius** is crossed for only about a week—by far the briefest transit—while **Virgo** dominates, with the Sun spending about 44 days in her region.  
- Over time, precession (the slow wobble of Earth’s axis) shifts these ranges roughly one day every 70 years.

The Mazzaroth column preserves the Hebrew constellation names from your *Mazarroth.pdf* reference【6†Mazarroth†L1-L89】, maintaining the tribal attributions in your system (e.g., Moznayim = Dan, Keshet = Naphtali, Ish ha-Nachash = Joseph).

What were the dates in 1974, January?

---

In **January 1974**, the Sun’s apparent path across the sky followed the same constellational sequence as today, but each boundary was shifted by **less than one day** compared to 2025.  
(Precession only alters the apparent solar position by about **0.8 days per 50 years**—so between 1974 and 2025, the difference is under one day total.)

Here’s the breakdown for **January 1974**, showing where the Sun actually was:

| Date Range (1974) | Constellation | Hebrew (Mazzaroth) | Tribal Association |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Jan 1 – Jan 18 1974** | **Keshet (Sagittarius)** | קֶשֶׁת “The Bow” | **Naphtali** – the free runner / archer |
| **Jan 19 – Feb 15 1974** | **Gedi (Capricornus)** | גְּדִי “The Kid / Goat” | **Asher** – abundance, “royal dainties” |

So in January 1974 the Sun began the month in **Keshet (Sagittarius)** and crossed into **Gedi (Capricornus)** around **January 19**, following the same ecliptic boundaries as in the current epoch—just fractionally earlier by a few hours of right ascension.
