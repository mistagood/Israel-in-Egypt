Relating to the adage, if you don’t like something change it let’s analyze the trend of rhinoplasty and its rise as a psychological phenomenon. What were the most common practices for rhino probably plastics in the beginning, but look at Hollywood and the changing of names and noses in order to not seem so Jewish, and then let’s look at that trend spreading to the actors, and all actors following the trend, and how those said or followed certain European ideals of beauty

### Early Practices and Psychological Aspects of Rhinoplasty

Rhinoplasty, historically rooted in medical necessity and functionality, has evolved significantly due to psychological and cultural factors. The initial focus was on reconstructive surgery for congenital defects, trauma, or disease. However, as societal norms shifted towards the aesthetic, the psychological motivations behind rhinoplasty became more prominent.

### Hollywood Influence and Ethnic Identity

In the early 20th century, Hollywood played a crucial role in shaping beauty standards, particularly influencing the trend of rhinoplasty among actors. During this period, many Jewish actors underwent rhinoplasty to conform to the prevailing Eurocentric beauty ideals and to minimize ethnic markers that could affect their career opportunities. This trend was driven by the desire to avoid ethnic stereotyping and to fit into the mainstream, which often equated success with a more "Anglo-Saxon" appearance.

**Examples of Hollywood Influence:**
- **Fanny Brice**: A famous early example, she underwent rhinoplasty to refine her nose and align more closely with the beauty standards of the time.
- **Other Actors**: Numerous actors and actresses changed their names and underwent cosmetic procedures to fit Hollywood's ideals, which often meant adopting less ethnically identifiable appearances.

### Spreading Trends and Psychological Phenomenon

The trend initiated by Hollywood celebrities soon spread to the general public. As actors became role models, their decisions to undergo rhinoplasty influenced fans and the wider society. This phenomenon was rooted in several psychological factors:

1. **Self-Image and Confidence**: Individuals sought rhinoplasty to improve their self-esteem and confidence, influenced by the perceived success and beauty of celebrities.
2. **Social Acceptance**: Conforming to beauty standards was often seen as a way to gain social acceptance and avoid discrimination.
3. **Media Influence**: The portrayal of ideal beauty in movies, magazines, and later on social media platforms reinforced the desire for rhinoplasty.

### Evolution of Beauty Ideals

The aesthetic goals of rhinoplasty have evolved, reflecting broader cultural shifts and changing perceptions of beauty:

- **Early Practices**: Initially, rhinoplasty techniques were relatively crude, focusing on significant reductions and alterations to fit a narrow definition of beauty.
- **Mid-20th Century**: Techniques improved, and the focus shifted towards more natural and proportional outcomes. Surgeons like Dr. Irving Goldman emphasized the importance of a nose that complemented the overall facial structure.
- **Contemporary Trends**: Today, there is a growing appreciation for diverse beauty standards. Surgeons aim to enhance a person's natural features while maintaining ethnic identity. The emphasis is on balance, harmony, and individuality rather than conforming to a single ideal.

### Psychological and Social Implications

Rhinoplasty as a psychological phenomenon reflects deeper societal issues related to identity, self-worth, and cultural assimilation:

- **Identity and Ethnicity**: For many, rhinoplasty was a way to navigate complex identities and societal pressures. The choice to undergo surgery often involved weighing personal and professional benefits against cultural heritage and authenticity.
- **Perception of Beauty**: The shifting ideals of beauty, influenced by media and celebrity culture, underscore how societal standards can shape individual desires and actions.
- **Mental Health**: While rhinoplasty can boost self-esteem for many, it also highlights the potential psychological impact of societal pressures and the importance of addressing underlying issues of self-acceptance and mental health.

### Conclusion

The rise of rhinoplasty in America, particularly influenced by Hollywood, illustrates a complex interplay between cultural norms, psychological motivations, and evolving beauty standards. Initially driven by the desire to conform to Eurocentric ideals, the trend has expanded and diversified, reflecting broader societal changes and a growing acceptance of individual and ethnic diversity in beauty. The historical context of rhinoplasty underscores the significant role of societal pressures in shaping personal choices and the continuous evolution of what is considered beautiful.

So let’s think about how ironic it is that so many people look in the mirror and are displeased by their facial features and so, they choose rhinoplasty because they don’t like their face. literally cut off their noses to spite their faces. How does the phenomenal experience of perception relate to this idea? We select surgical procedures that make us reflect our oppressors while simultaneously we seek to overthrow them.  Is this not the very desire to be the tyrant? The illogical desire, or is rooted in a self mutilation and self harm that we cannot avoid noticing here I don’t like my oppressors, and yet I strive to succeed among them, which makes me have to conform to them. Turning me into the ugly thing while I spitefully work against the thing, I’m trying to Master this is the definition of ‘cutting off one’s nose to spite your face’.  And this. Is the great poignant point of this entire thread.

The irony you highlight in the context of rhinoplasty and societal pressures is indeed profound. It delves into the complexities of identity, perception, and the psychological impact of conforming to oppressive beauty standards. Here's a deeper analysis of how the phenomenon of perception relates to this idea:

### Perception and Identity

**1. Self-Perception and Societal Standards:**
   - **Self-Image:** Individuals often internalize societal standards of beauty, leading to dissatisfaction with their natural appearance. This internalization is influenced by media, cultural norms, and social interactions.
   - **Conformity:** To gain acceptance and success, many people feel compelled to conform to these standards, which can involve altering their physical features through procedures like rhinoplasty.

**2. Psychological Conflict:**
   - **Identity vs. Conformity:** There's an inherent conflict between one's authentic self and the desire to conform to societal expectations. This can create a psychological struggle, where individuals feel pressured to change aspects of themselves to fit in while simultaneously feeling resentment towards the standards they are trying to meet.
   - **Oppressor’s Standards:** The irony lies in adopting the features of the perceived oppressors, which can be seen as a form of self-betrayal or self-mutilation. This is where the adage "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face" becomes relevant—individuals alter themselves to succeed within a system they fundamentally oppose.

### The Desire to Overcome and Conform

**1. Desire for Power and Acceptance:**
   - **Power Dynamics:** By conforming to the oppressors' standards, individuals may believe they are gaining power, acceptance, and opportunities within that societal framework. This desire to succeed and overcome often means adopting the very traits and behaviors of those in power.
   - **Illusion of Control:** This can be seen as an illogical or paradoxical desire—to overthrow the oppressor by becoming like them. It reflects a deep-seated need for validation and success, even if it means compromising one's identity.

**2. Self-Mutilation and Self-Harm:**
   - **Psychological Toll:** The process of changing one's appearance to fit societal norms can be viewed as a form of self-harm or self-mutilation, driven by the pressures of an oppressive beauty standard. This can lead to long-term psychological effects, including issues with self-esteem, identity, and mental health.
   - **Cultural and Historical Context:** Historically, marginalized groups have often altered their appearances to avoid discrimination or gain acceptance, which can be seen as a survival mechanism. However, it also perpetuates the cycle of conforming to and reinforcing oppressive standards.

### Reflecting on the Irony

**1. The Tyranny of Beauty Standards:**
   - **Cultural Critique:** The irony of striving to meet oppressive beauty standards while despising them highlights a fundamental issue with societal norms. It points to the pervasive and insidious nature of these standards and the psychological impact they have on individuals.
   - **Desire to Be the Tyrant:** This phenomenon can be interpreted as a desire to become the oppressor to gain power and control, which is an illogical yet deeply ingrained response to societal pressures.

**2. Breaking the Cycle:**
   - **Awareness and Resistance:** Understanding this irony and its psychological roots can help individuals and society as a whole to challenge and resist oppressive beauty standards. Embracing diverse beauty ideals and promoting self-acceptance are crucial steps in breaking this cycle.
   - **Cultural Shift:** A shift towards valuing individuality and rejecting narrow beauty standards can help mitigate the psychological conflict and reduce the pressure to conform through procedures like rhinoplasty.

### Conclusion

The phenomenon of rhinoplasty and its psychological implications reveal a poignant irony: individuals change their appearances to conform to oppressive beauty standards, thereby perpetuating the very system they may resent. This process can be seen as a form of self-mutilation driven by the desire for acceptance and success within an oppressive framework. Recognizing and addressing this irony is essential for fostering a more inclusive and accepting society that values diversity and individuality over conformity to unrealistic standards.

This is far beyond even oppression or inclusion. What’s very central is the mechanism that must exist allowing humans to disassociate from parts of their body/identity and phenomenal experience 

---

You're pointing to a deeper psychological and philosophical issue about human identity and self-perception. The central mechanism you're describing involves the ability of humans to disassociate from parts of their body or identity, which can be understood through several psychological and philosophical lenses:

### Psychological Mechanisms

1. **Cognitive Dissonance:**
   - **Definition:** Cognitive dissonance occurs when there is a conflict between beliefs, values, or attitudes and behaviors. To reduce the discomfort caused by this inconsistency, individuals may alter their attitudes or behaviors.
   - **Application to Rhinoplasty:** Individuals who feel societal pressure to conform to beauty standards might undergo rhinoplasty to align their appearance with these standards, even if it conflicts with their deeper values or sense of self. The alteration helps resolve the dissonance between their self-perception and societal expectations.

2. **Body Image and Dissociation:**
   - **Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD):** This psychological condition involves an obsessive focus on perceived flaws in appearance, which can lead to extreme measures like repeated cosmetic surgeries.
   - **Dissociation:** On a broader scale, individuals might disassociate from parts of their body that don't meet their or society's standards of beauty. This dissociation can manifest as a detachment or alienation from those body parts, making them more willing to alter them surgically.

3. **Identity and Social Comparison:**
   - **Social Comparison Theory:** People determine their worth based on how they compare to others. This can lead to dissatisfaction with one's appearance when compared to societal ideals.
   - **Conformity:** The desire to belong and be accepted within a social group can drive individuals to conform to its standards, even if it means altering their natural appearance.

### Philosophical Perspectives

1. **Phenomenology:**
   - **Body as Lived Experience:** Phenomenology examines the body as lived experience rather than a mere physical object. This perspective considers how societal pressures can alter one's lived experience of their body, leading to a disassociation from parts that don't fit societal ideals.
   - **Merleau-Ponty:** The philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty emphasized that our perception of our bodies is intertwined with our environment and social context. Changes in societal beauty standards can thus fundamentally alter our body image and self-perception.

2. **Existentialism:**
   - **Authenticity:** Existentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir explored the concept of authenticity—being true to one's self. Conforming to external standards at the expense of one's authentic self can be seen as living in bad faith.
   - **Self-Alienation:** The existentialist idea of self-alienation occurs when individuals lose touch with their true selves due to external pressures. Undergoing rhinoplasty to meet societal standards can be viewed as a form of self-alienation.

### Sociocultural Context

1. **Cultural Hegemony:**
   - **Definition:** Cultural hegemony, a concept by Antonio Gramsci, refers to the dominance of one social class's worldview, which becomes the accepted cultural norm.
   - **Beauty Standards:** Dominant beauty standards often reflect the preferences of the ruling class. Individuals alter their appearances to align with these hegemonic standards, leading to widespread acceptance of certain beauty ideals.

2. **Postcolonial Theory:**
   - **Colonial Influence:** Postcolonial theorists argue that colonialism has imposed Western standards of beauty on colonized societies, leading to a disassociation from indigenous identities and features.
   - **Internalized Oppression:** This internalized oppression causes individuals to alter their bodies to conform to the imposed standards, which can be seen as a legacy of colonial power dynamics.

### The Mechanism of Disassociation

The mechanism allowing humans to disassociate from parts of their body or identity involves a complex interplay of psychological, philosophical, and sociocultural factors:

1. **Internal Conflict:** Psychological mechanisms like cognitive dissonance and body dysmorphic disorder create internal conflicts that lead individuals to seek changes in their appearance to alleviate discomfort.
2. **External Pressures:** Societal beauty standards, reinforced by media and cultural hegemony, exert external pressure on individuals to conform, leading to disassociation from their natural features.
3. **Philosophical Insights:** Phenomenological and existential perspectives provide deeper insights into how our lived experience and sense of authenticity are affected by these pressures, leading to self-alienation and the desire for conformity.
4. **Sociocultural Dynamics:** Historical and cultural contexts, including colonialism and cultural hegemony, shape the standards of beauty and the pressures to conform, leading individuals to alter their appearances to fit these ideals.

### Conclusion

The phenomenon of altering one's appearance through procedures like rhinoplasty reflects a complex mechanism of disassociation rooted in psychological conflict, philosophical notions of self and authenticity, and sociocultural pressures. Understanding this mechanism requires a multifaceted approach that considers the interplay of individual psychology, societal norms, and cultural history. Recognizing and addressing these factors can help foster a more inclusive and accepting society that values diverse expressions of beauty and identity.
