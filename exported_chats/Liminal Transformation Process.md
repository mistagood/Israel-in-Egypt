# Liminal Transformation Process



---

In order to have transformation, one must exist in a state and accept that one is and is not. That is to say, one must accept and cultivate within the liminal state between becoming what one envisions or desires. In order to transition, and this is known as the time of transition, in order to transition, one has to go from existing in the state of accepting what one is, to becoming that which is not already existing, but one must realize that the thing or that the person themselves in fact exists as they are and as they will be, because they can only develop what is within them, and so they are what they are, and they are not what they are, because they will become something else, so they're not stuck in what they are, and they are not what they will become, but they are because they will become it if they can move through the liminal state, which is the exit way from what one is and the borderland of transition to what one will become.

This is a profound articulation of the paradoxical nature of transformation. What you’ve described is the essence of *liminality*—the sacred and volatile threshold where identity dissolves and reconstitutes. Let’s refine and shape it into a flowing exposé-style narrative, suitable for voiceover or documentary script:

---

To be transformed… one must first dwell in contradiction.

Not denial. Not delusion. But the sacred paradox: I am, and I am not.

Because transformation doesn’t come to the static. It requires motion—between what *is* and what *could be*. And this is the liminal state. A space not defined by arrival, but by transition. The borderland between form and becoming.

To change, one must first accept what they are—not as finality, but as foundation. Because what you are is not the limit of what you can be… it is the raw material.

And what you will become? It already exists—within. Not fully formed, not yet named, but present, in seed form. Dormant until dared into emergence.

So the self becomes a riddle: I *am* because I *am not yet*. And I am *not* because I *will be*. 

The liminal space is the chrysalis. It is darkness and uncertainty, where the old self dissolves, and something unrecognizable begins to stir.

Most avoid it. Because the borderlands are not safe. They are wilderness.

But for those who enter, something miraculous happens.

They emerge… not as who they were, and not as who they wished to be—but as the *true form* that only the fire of in-between could reveal.

Absolutely. Here's a revised version—more precise in its logic, retaining the spiritual and philosophical weight, while flowing smoothly for narration:

---

In order for transformation to occur, one must enter a paradox.

You must be willing to exist in a state where you are—and are not.

That is the essence of transition.

Because change does not come from rejecting what you are. It begins by recognizing it. Accepting it. Holding it, not as a prison, but as a starting point.

At the same time, you must accept that who you are is not all you will be.

What you will become does not exist yet—not in full form. And yet, it *does* exist. It lives within you, waiting to be drawn out.

So you are both what you are—and what you are not—at once.

This is the liminal space. The threshold.

It is not comfortable. It is not clear. But it is the only passage.

The liminal is not the thing, nor the goal. It is the crossing.

And to cross, you must release your grip on certainty. You must walk as if you are already what you hope to become—even when nothing around you confirms it.

Because transformation is not about adding something new. It is about unfolding something hidden.

You cannot become what you are not.

But you *can* reveal what has not yet been seen.

That is the mystery. That is the way.
