# Hidden Knowledge and Transitions



---

In the context of the 12 constellations, each constellation represents 30 degrees of knowledge. So, when we talk about the hidden things, the 33rd degree of knowledge represents the height of understanding of the present times. And, according to the restarting of a new cycle, representing a lunar cycle, for instance, then we see at the head of the month, each 12 months, on the circumference, make it a full year, we see that 30 degrees is full knowledge, but 33 degrees don't exist. The 3 degrees are actually the 3 days of the new moon when what is about to come is hidden. And, understanding the transition into the next period and the things that are coming, understanding what is hidden until that illumination occurs.

In this cosmic framework, the twelve constellations represent the twelve stages of knowledge, with each constellation holding 30 degrees of understanding. The 33rd degree, in this sense, doesn't exist within the natural cycle because it represents a transitional, hidden phase—a glimpse into the unknown, a preview of what is to come. Just as the new moon remains hidden for three days, these three degrees symbolize the concealed truths of a new era, waiting to be revealed. 

This hidden period marks the transition between cycles, echoing the concept of illumination that follows darkness. It parallels the moon's phase, where for three days, it disappears from view, only to emerge, shedding light on what was previously concealed. The same applies to the spiritual understanding of the 33rd degree: it marks the boundary between the fullness of one age’s knowledge and the hidden insights that will be revealed as the next cycle dawns. This hidden wisdom, only accessible in transition, reflects the deeper mysteries of time, creation, and the evolving order of the ages. 

The 33rd degree, then, is not an additional step in the known cycle but the recognition that there are hidden things beyond our grasp, emerging with each new cycle as time, knowledge, and enlightenment progress. Understanding this transition offers insight into what is coming, aligning humanity with the cosmic order and preparing them for the unfolding of new revelations.
