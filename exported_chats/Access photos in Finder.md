To access the photos from your **Photo Library** in the **Finder window** on a Mac, follow these steps:

---

### 🔍 **Option 1: Access via the Photos Library Package**

1. **Open Finder**
2. Go to your **Pictures** folder:
   - In Finder, click **Go** > **Home** > **Pictures**  
   - Or use the shortcut: `Command + Shift + H`, then open the **Pictures** folder.
3. Locate **Photos Library.photoslibrary**
4. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on `Photos Library.photoslibrary`
5. Select **Show Package Contents**
6. Navigate to:
   ```
   Masters/Originals/Year/Month/Day/...
   ```
   or
   ```
   Originals/YYYY/MM/DD/...
   ```
   (Apple changes the folder structure slightly depending on the macOS version.)

⚠️ *Do not move or delete items from here — it may corrupt your Photos Library. Instead, copy them if needed.*

### 📤 **Option 2: Export from Photos App**

If you just want to access certain images easily:

1. Open the **Photos** app
2. Select the photo(s) you want
3. Go to **File > Export > Export [number] Photo(s)...**
4. Choose format and destination folder (e.g., Desktop or custom folder)
5. Click **Export**

Then you can find those exported photos in Finder in the location you chose.
