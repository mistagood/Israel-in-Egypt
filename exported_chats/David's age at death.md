How old was David when he died

According to the Bible, **David died at the age of seventy (70)**.  

This is stated directly in **1 Kings 2:10–11**:

> *“So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.  
> And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:  
> seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.”*  
> — **1 Kings 2:10-11**

To reconstruct his age:
- He began to reign at **age 30** (see **2 Samuel 5:4**).  
  > *“David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.”*
- Therefore, 30 + 40 = **70 years old** when he died.  

So, **King David died at about 70 years of age**, after ruling Israel for 40 years—seven from Hebron and thirty-three from Jerusalem.
