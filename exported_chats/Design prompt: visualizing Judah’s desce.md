# Design prompt: visualizing Judah’s descendants



---



---

Here’s a tight layout prompt you can paste into your diagram/slide tool to keep things clean and printable.

**“Visualize Judah’s descendants from 1 Chronicles 2 as a left‑to‑right family tree grouped by household clusters (Judah → sons → key grandsons → notable lines like Hezron→Ram→Amminadab→Nahshon→Salma→Boaz; Hezron→Caleb/Kelubai→Hur→Salma→Bethlehem; Hezron→Jerahmeel; Shelah’s crafts guilds). Highlight name variants (e.g., Caleb/Kelubai; Salma/Salmon if cross‑referenced) with subtle badges, and add a caption note for disputed/ambiguous entries or overlaps (e.g., Salma fathering Bethlehem, guilds of byssus and pottery under Shelah) so viewers know what’s text‑explicit vs. inferred cross‑refs.”**

I don't understand where I would paste this. What do you mean, diagram or slide tool?

You’re right to ask. That earlier line only makes sense **if you were already inside some diagram-making app**. You’re not. You’re just asking for the biblical list. So let’s stay grounded and drop the software-language.

Here’s what you actually asked for:

**“Give me the list of Judah’s descendants in 1 Chronicles 2.”**

So here it is, clean, direct, nothing extra—**straight from the text, in order, using the narrative flow of the chapter**.

# **Judah’s Line as Given in 1 Chronicles 2**

### **Judah → 5 sons**
1. **Er** (by Bathshua the Canaanitess)  
2. **Onan** (by Bathshua)  
3. **Shelah** (by Bathshua)  
4. **Pharez** (by Tamar)  
5. **Zerah** (by Tamar)

Er dies first; the line continues through **Pharez**.

---

# **Pharez → 2 sons**
6. **Hezron**  
7. **Hamul**

---

# **Zerah’s sons (Judah’s line running parallel)**
8. **Zimri**  
9. **Ethan**  
10. **Heman**  
11. **Calcol**  
12. **Dara**  
(These are noted as “five,” which forms the Zerahite branch.)

---

# **Hezron’s line (the core royal line)**
Hezron has three principal sons:

13. **Jerahmeel**  
14. **Ram**  
15. **Chelubai (Caleb)**  

These three become major sub-clans.

---

# **Ram → 1 son**
16. **Amminadab**

Amminadab → **Nahshon** (leader of Judah in Moses’ era)

17. **Nahshon**  
Nahshon → **Salma (Salmon)**

18. **Salma**  
Salma → **Boaz**

19. **Boaz**  
Boaz → **Obed**  

20. **Obed**  
Obed → **Jesse**

21. **Jesse**  
Jesse → **David and his brothers**  
(Jesse’s seven sons; David is eighth in other texts, seven listed in Chronicles.)

---

# **Caleb (Chelubai) branch**
Caleb has multiple wives: Azubah, Jerioth, Ephah, Maachah, and others. From these wives and concubines come:

22. **Ishu**  
23. **Shobab**  
24. **Ardon**  
25. **Hur** (from Ephrath)  
Hur → **Uri**  
Uri → **Bezaleel** (the craftsman of the Tabernacle)

Caleb also produces several other sons via concubines Ephah and Maachah (listed in vv. 46–48).

---

# **Jerahmeel branch**
Jerahmeel, Hezron’s firstborn, produces:

26. **Ram (the firstborn)**  
27. **Bunah**  
28. **Oren**  
29. **Ozem**  
30. **Ahijah**

Ram → daughters and sons including **Maaz**, **Jamin**, **Eker**, and others through his wives Atarah and Abishur.

(The Jerahmeelite line is lengthy; I’m giving the main heads.)

---

# **Shelah branch (back to Judah’s sons)**
Shelah gives rise to guild-families:

31. **Er the father of Lecah**  
32. **Laadah the father of Mareshah**  
33. The families of the house of **linen workers**  
34. **Jokim**  
35. **Cozeba**  
36. **Joash**  
37. **Saraph**  
38. Families of **potters** who lived in Netaim and Gederah

Shelah’s line is not royal but *crafts-based*—a detail many skip.

---

# **Special note: Hur → Salma → Bethlehem**
This is the line that caught your attention with the “mystery” around Hur.

Hur (Caleb’s son)  
→ **Uri**  
→ **Bezaleel** (the artisan)  
→ **Salma**, called **“the father of Bethlehem.”**

This is where the text quietly roots Bethlehem **not in Judah proper**, but **in Caleb’s/Ephrath’s subline**, which is why it feels like a strange insertion.

Chronicles deliberately hides this in a list—yet that one line (“Salma the father of Bethlehem”) reveals the entire socio-political reshaping of Judah’s geography.

If you want, I can now **reconstruct the complete cleaned chart** (straight textual order, no software jargon) or isolate the **Hur → Bethlehem** branch for your documentary narrative.
