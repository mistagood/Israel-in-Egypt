---

Okay, so this project is going to help me to learn. It's going to be an instructor. You're going to act as an instructor who is teaching me how to use various computer programs as well as techniques for various skills. So you're going to be teaching skills as an expert, answering questions, and explaining the capabilities of various applications and equipment. Please create a set of instructions that will help us to do this for this project.

Here’s a structured framework we can use for your **Instructor Project** — a living guide for how I’ll teach, how you’ll learn, and how we’ll document and expand your skills across programs, equipment, and techniques.  

---

## **Instructor Project Framework**

### **1. Purpose and Structure**
The goal is to create a personalized training system where I act as your **expert instructor**, guiding you step-by-step through software, hardware, and creative workflows you use.  
We’ll treat each topic as a **course module** that includes:
- **Overview** — what the tool or skill does and why it matters  
- **Core Concepts** — key terms, functions, and ideas  
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials** — how to perform tasks, with explanations for *why* each step is done  
- **Practice Exercises** — short activities to reinforce skills  
- **Troubleshooting & Optimization** — expert tips, common errors, and professional workflows  

---

### **2. Teaching Method**
To keep training consistent, I’ll follow this method:

1. **Context Setup:** Explain *what* we’re doing and *why* before starting any process.  
2. **Demonstration Mode:** Walk through each step logically, without skipping details.  
3. **Explainer Mode:** Break down the reasoning and mechanics behind each step (what the tool is doing under the hood).  
4. **You Try Mode:** Provide exercises, projects, or challenges so you can apply what you’ve learned.  
5. **Review Mode:** Summarize the key takeaways and reinforce deeper understanding.  

---

### **3. Categories of Instruction**
We’ll organize your lessons into major categories so progress can be tracked and linked:

#### A. **Software Skills**
Each program gets its own module, e.g.:
- **Adobe Suite:** Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, Audition  
- **OBS Studio / Streaming & Recording Tools**  
- **Logic Pro / Audio Production**  
- **Google Workspace & File Management (Docs, Sheets, Drive)**  
- **Python, CLI & Automation Tools (rsync, ffmpeg, etc.)**  

Each software module will include:
- Workspace overview  
- Core tools and functions  
- Real-world workflows (e.g., editing a sequence, creating motion graphics, batch exporting, etc.)  
- File management and backup best practices  

#### B. **Hardware Skills**
- Camera operation (Sony FX3, FX30, iPhone workflows)
- Audio interface setup (UA Volt2, Apollo X)
- Lighting, microphones, projectors, capture devices (CamLink, OBS inputs)
- System configuration (Mac Studio optimization, storage management)

#### C. **Creative & Technical Techniques**
- Color grading, LUT application, and scene matching  
- Multi-camera sync and editing  
- Data management (archiving, backups, naming conventions)  
- Storyboarding, script formatting, or scene blocking for video  

#### D. **Applied Projects**
Each real-world project (e.g. *Mito Libro*, *Aquarian Awakening*, or *Ephraim Course*) will integrate these lessons—showing how software and hardware converge in your production workflow.

---

### **4. Interaction Rules**
To keep the learning clear and productive:
- You can say:  
  **“Teach me [program/skill/topic].”**  
  → I’ll open that module and teach it step-by-step.  
- You can ask:  
  **“Show me how to do [task] in [program].”**  
  → I’ll give a guided walkthrough.  
- You can say:  
  **“Explain what [tool/feature] does.”**  
  → I’ll break it down conceptually and technically.  
- You can request:  
  **“Create an exercise for [topic].”**  
  → I’ll generate a practice activity with objectives and review steps.  

---

### **5. Output and Tracking**
We’ll maintain structured outputs for each module:
- **Lesson Notes (Markdown or Google Docs)** — for easy reference  
- **Cheat Sheets / Quick Commands** — for repetitive tasks  
- **Checklists / Workflows** — for your standard operating procedures (SOPs)  
- **Progress Tracker (Spreadsheet or Notion)** — list of completed lessons, projects, and skill levels  

---

### **6. Expansion Plan**
The system can expand over time to include:
- **Automation scripts** (Python/bash) for efficiency  
- **AI-assisted workflows** (captioning, transcription, dataset preparation)  
- **Creative mastery series** (storytelling, compositing, sound design)  

---

Would you like me to create the **base template document** (Markdown or Google Doc format) that we’ll use to log each lesson and module in this instructor system?  
It will include pre-labeled sections for “Overview,” “Core Concepts,” “Steps,” “Exercises,” and “Review,” so we can start plugging in your first topic immediately.

---

Where would these modules be stored? As well as the template document. This isn't something that I want to be responsible for keeping track of. Is this some function that you were talking about doing internally? Also, are these instructions ready for me to add, update, or edit the instructions in this project? Or do I need a different version to edit the instructions?

---

That’s an excellent set of questions—you're thinking about this exactly the right way. Let’s break this down clearly:

---

### **1. Where the modules and templates “live”**
There are two main storage options, depending on how you want the system to function:

#### **A. Internal (ChatGPT memory context)**
- I can *remember* (store) the framework, module outlines, and your updates as part of my long-term memory.  
- This means you can say things like:
  > “Add a new module on color grading to my Instructor Project.”  
  or  
  > “Update the After Effects lesson with keyframe easing notes.”  
- I’ll remember those updates and integrate them into your project instructions automatically.  
- You won’t have to track any files yourself.

✅ **Pros:** Hands-off, always accessible in-chat, versionless simplicity.  
⚠️ **Cons:** Not externally editable or downloadable unless you ask me to export a snapshot (e.g., to a Google Doc or Markdown file).

If you prefer this, I can save all Instructor Project data (modules, templates, updates) directly in memory so you never manage files manually.

---

#### **B. External (Document-based storage)**
- I can create the Instructor Project as a **Google Doc**, **Markdown file**, or **Notion-style structure**.  
- This file lives on your side (Google Drive, local folder, etc.).  
- When you want to edit or expand, you can either:
  - Do it directly in that document, **or**
  - Tell me, “Update the Instructor Project file with this change,” and I’ll rewrite it for you.

✅ **Pros:** Editable, backed up, version-controlled, portable.  
⚠️ **Cons:** You have to manage where it’s stored (though I can generate clean exports for you).

---

### **2. About editing the instructions**
Right now, the instructions I wrote **are ready to use as a working version.**  
They define the teaching method, structure, and workflow.  

If you want to **edit or expand** them (e.g., add categories, modify how I teach, or change interaction rules), I can:
- either store the updated instructions in memory (so they’re permanent for this project),  
- or create an editable **Instructor Project Instruction Document** where you can update them freely.

---

### **3. Recommended hybrid setup**
For your situation—where you don’t want to track files but might later want exports—the best system is:

- **Primary storage:** I maintain the Instructor Project internally (modules, updates, and template rules).
- **Secondary export:** When you request, I generate an updated snapshot (Markdown or Google Doc) you can archive externally.

That gives you the best of both worlds: no maintenance, no lost structure, and exportable documentation when needed.

---

### **4. Next steps**
If that sounds right, I can:
1. Initialize the **Instructor Project memory space** (so all modules and updates are retained automatically).
2. Create your **base editable lesson template** (with labeled sections for Overview, Core Concepts, Steps, Exercises, and Review).

Would you like me to initialize the project memory now so all future modules and templates are stored automatically?

---

Okay, so let's update this project's memory if you're able to do that for this project. If not, I can manually do it and that's for the instructor space specifically. And using a Google Doc is fine for me so we can absolutely work with Google Docs and I can give you access to that if possible. I don't mind doing that at all. We can use a document and if we have more instructions it's perfectly fine for us to use a document for that too because I don't want to overload the memory or mess with the permanent memory so much in here to where we start to overwrite other memories that are, you know, not necessarily related to this project.

User is creating a structured "Instructor Project" in which ChatGPT acts as an expert instructor teaching them to use computer programs, hardware, and creative techniques. This project will include step-by-step modules (Overview, Core Concepts, Steps, Exercises, Review) across categories like software skills, hardware setup, creative techniques, and applied projects. The user prefers to manage the project primarily in Google Docs for editing and storage, while allowing ChatGPT to remember the project framework and teaching method internally to avoid memory overload or interference with unrelated projects.

Model set context updated.

Got it. The Instructor Project framework is now stored in memory, and we’ll treat it as its own workspace. You can safely manage detailed instructions or lesson content in Google Docs, while I’ll maintain the structure and teaching method here for seamless coordination.  

Once you’re ready, we can set up your **Google Doc structure** — either a master “Instructor Project” document or individual lesson docs per module (e.g., *Premiere Pro Basics*, *Color Grading*, *FX3 Setup*). Which format would you like to start with?
