# GT Independence Payment Dispute



---

 Who is in charge of oversight for financial management services dealing with the DDS in California? I'm with the Westside Regional Center, and the financial management service, GT Independence, is implementing their own new policies, which conflict with paying us for the contracts that we have for several months. They're trying to reauthorize the services to get the Regional Center to send them a new authorization, which will begin January 1st, when our authorization, which they have, began October 1st. So, they will be cutting off three months of my son's services, which are already being provided. Now, we have it in our spending plan, and it's authorized, and we have a contract. So, they are legally obligated to pay us, yet they're trying to get the authorization to be changed to the 1st of January, 2025, which will cut off three months. Who is in charge of auditing them at oversight? What's the process? Because I want to, I don't want to, but I have to sue them, make a demand for payment, and get that process going. So how do I call for an audit?

The Regional Center has not been helpful and they’re being pushed around by the FMS who seems to be controlling everything refusing to pay so they are simply saying that their new policy is that they won’t backpay and that they need a new authorization for that reason because the other authorization came in a bit late I have the statements that say that the authorization is in the system now and so they can pay it, but they’re trying to get a new authorization which would then negate three months. I’ve had no help with the Regional Center coordinator and we have contracts and services have been provided and they’re refusing to pay them. They have claimed that they can no longer backpay or that has to be in earlier or that the date was too late and that’s why they can’t do it, but it doesn’t make sense because the Regional Center coordinator told me that she has other clients and she just sent those in late and they’re paying them so this is why I’m asking about an audit.

---

If the Regional Center and the Financial Management Service (FMS), in this case GT Independence, are refusing to pay for authorized services that have been provided, and you suspect that their actions are inconsistent, arbitrary, or violate your contractual rights, you can request an audit and escalate the matter in the following ways:

### 1. **Contact DDS for Oversight**
   - The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) oversees regional centers and FMS agencies. You can contact DDS directly to report these issues and request an investigation or audit. 
   - **DDS Consumer Rights and Complaint Line**: (916) 654-1690
   - Email DDS at **DDSOmbudsperson@dds.ca.gov** to file a formal complaint regarding GT Independence's refusal to backpay and the inconsistencies you've observed.

### 2. **File a Formal Complaint with DDS**
   - DDS provides a **Whistleblower Complaint Form** to report misconduct or financial irregularities. This can trigger an investigation into GT Independence's policies and actions.
   - Whistleblower complaints can be filed online or sent via email to **DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov**.
   - Highlight the discrepancies you’ve observed, such as other clients receiving backpay while your requests are denied.

### 3. **Fair Hearing Request**
   - If services are authorized in your son’s spending plan but payments are being denied, you can file for a **Fair Hearing** through the Regional Center. 
   - Request the hearing in writing within 30 days of being informed of the refusal to pay.
   - During this process, you can present evidence such as:
     - The authorization date and proof that services were provided.
     - Discrepancies in how other clients are being treated.
     - The Regional Center's and FMS’s obligation to honor authorized services.

### 4. **Contact the Office of Clients' Rights Advocacy (OCRA)**
   - OCRA is an independent agency that advocates for regional center clients. They can assist with filing complaints, preparing for hearings, and taking further action.
   - **Contact Information for Westside Regional Center**:
     - **Matt Alivio**, Clients’ Rights Advocate: (310) 846-4949
     - Email: **Matt.Alivio@disabilityrightsca.org**

### 5. **Engage with Your Local Area Board**
   - Area Boards are part of the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and provide oversight and advocacy for individuals served by Regional Centers. They may intervene if there are systemic issues.
   - Contact your local area board to file a complaint about how your case is being handled.

### 6. **Prepare for Legal Action**
   - Gather all relevant documentation, including:
     - Contracts with GT Independence and the Regional Center.
     - Statements confirming services were provided and authorized.
     - Communication with the Regional Center and GT Independence.
     - Proof of inconsistent treatment (e.g., other clients receiving backpay).
   - Consider consulting an attorney specializing in disability rights or administrative law to send a **Demand for Payment** to GT Independence, warning of legal action if the matter is not resolved.

### 7. **Request an Audit**
   - Send a written request for an audit of GT Independence's practices to DDS and copy your Regional Center. Specify:
     - The authorization dates in question.
     - The refusal to honor backpay despite evidence of authorization.
     - Discrepancies in how other clients are being treated.
   - Use the DDS Complaint Form or send a detailed letter outlining your concerns.

### Tips for Effective Advocacy:
   - Keep all communication in writing, and document phone calls, including the date, time, and name of the person you spoke with.
   - Send all correspondence via certified mail or email with read receipts to ensure it is received and logged.
   - Follow up persistently and escalate if necessary, ensuring your voice is heard at every level.

If these steps don’t yield results, pursuing legal action for breach of contract and non-payment may be the next step. An attorney can help ensure your son’s rights and services are protected.

 So I've spent the last 17 years, since my son was 7 years old, educating myself, earning 4 degrees, and becoming an advocate, and preparing to take care of him. And so we became vendors with the Regional Center, and his spending plan has supported creating the environment that has yielded amazing results in the last 2 years, which were the first 2 years of his participation in SDP. He went from 310 pounds, and on pharmaceuticals, to a healthy 190 pounds, or less, at 6 foot 1. His behaviors of aggression and hitting and punching holes in walls have completely stopped, even without the pharmaceuticals. He's learned to control himself, to speak so much more. His speech has increased at least by 100%. His social interaction is better. He has exercise, he has activities, and he has his family to guide him in doing it. I think that the first problem that GT Independence had with this is that they want to be the vendors. And they began giving us a hard time, and not paying invoices, way back in the summer. And even before that, we had many problems with invoices, but in the summer, they gave us major problems and demanded that we change our invoices, and started to ask us for minute details of every moment of the day and activities, creating a burden on us. Because we're not a part of their system that uses their caregiver app. This seems like a conflict of interest to me, for them to be the financial management service, and to be the vendor. And it seems like they're punishing us. No they haven’t paid us in several months and they are threatening to restart the authorization for January which will make us have to wait until January 26 to get paid. This will take four months at least away from us and out of his budget. It causes a great hardship and we can’t even afford to pay rent for the environment that we live and work in. By February will be homeless.

---

It’s clear you’ve worked incredibly hard to create an environment that has drastically improved your son’s quality of life, and the actions of GT Independence and the Regional Center appear to threaten that progress. The situation you describe does raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as well as possible violations of both the Lanterman Act and contractual obligations under the Self-Determination Program (SDP).

Here’s a detailed plan of action to address these issues:

---

### **1. Address the Conflict of Interest with GT Independence**
The dual role of GT Independence as both the Financial Management Service (FMS) and potential vendor may indeed pose a conflict of interest. FMS agencies are required to act as neutral parties under California’s SDP guidelines.

- **File a Formal Complaint with DDS:**
  Submit a detailed complaint to the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS), outlining the potential conflict of interest and how GT Independence's demands for excessive documentation and delays in payments are negatively impacting your son’s care. 
  - **Email:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov
  - **Phone:** (916) 654-1690
  - Include documentation of:
    - Late payments and unpaid invoices.
    - The hardship caused by their refusal to process payments.
    - Their attempts to take over as vendor.

---

### **2. File a Fair Hearing Request**
Under the Lanterman Act, you are entitled to a **Fair Hearing** when there is a disagreement with the Regional Center or FMS regarding services and payments.

- **Steps to Request a Fair Hearing:**
  1. **Write a Letter** to the Regional Center’s Fair Hearing Coordinator. Include:
     - Your son’s name and UCI number.
     - A clear description of the issue (e.g., failure to pay authorized invoices, efforts to retroactively change authorization dates, and burdensome administrative demands).
     - Documentation of harm caused, such as your inability to pay rent and the potential loss of housing.
  2. Submit the letter within 30 days of the last denial or communication indicating they would not pay.

- **Ask for an Emergency Resolution:**
  Due to the financial hardship, request an **expedited hearing** or emergency mediation.

---

### **3. Contact Disability Rights Advocates**
Disability Rights California (DRC) and the Office of Clients' Rights Advocacy (OCRA) specialize in advocating for individuals and families navigating these issues.

- **Office of Clients' Rights Advocacy:**
  - Advocate for the Westside Regional Center: Matt Alivio
  - **Phone:** (310) 846-4949
  - **Email:** Matt.Alivio@disabilityrightsca.org
  - Explain your situation and request immediate intervention.

---

### **4. Escalate to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities**
The State Council provides oversight and advocacy for regional centers and SDP participants. They can advocate on your behalf to ensure your son’s budget and services are preserved.

- **Contact Information:**
  - **Phone:** (916) 263-7919
  - **Email:** info@scdd.ca.gov

---

### **5. Demand Immediate Payment via Legal Notice**
You may need to send a **formal demand letter** to GT Independence, warning them of legal action for breach of contract and nonpayment. This step could prompt quicker resolution. A disability rights attorney or legal aid organization can assist with drafting the letter.

- **Include:**
  - Details of the authorized spending plan and contracts.
  - Documentation of unpaid invoices.
  - Proof of GT Independence’s refusal to process payments.
  - A deadline for payment to avoid legal action.

---

### **6. Pursue Legal Action**
If all administrative remedies fail, you may need to sue GT Independence for breach of contract. Consult a disability rights attorney or a legal aid organization to explore your options.

- **Potential Grounds for Legal Action:**
  - Breach of contract for failure to pay authorized services.
  - Violation of the Lanterman Act, which guarantees the right to services and supports.
  - Financial harm caused by unjustified delays in payment.

---

### **7. Gather Evidence**
Document everything related to this issue, including:
- Copies of all invoices and payment requests.
- Communication with GT Independence and the Regional Center.
- Records of authorization dates and spending plans.
- Evidence of harm caused by nonpayment (e.g., inability to pay rent).

---

### **8. Reach Out to Local Media or Advocacy Groups**
If the issue persists, raising public awareness can put pressure on GT Independence and the Regional Center to resolve the matter. Advocacy groups and local media may be interested in highlighting your story as an example of how families are impacted by administrative failures.

---

### Immediate Steps:
1. File a **Fair Hearing Request** with the Regional Center.
2. Contact DDS, OCRA, and the State Council for oversight and advocacy.
3. Send a **formal demand letter** to GT Independence.
4. Seek legal advice from a disability rights attorney or legal aid organization.

The combination of advocacy, administrative action, and potential legal steps should help resolve this issue and ensure your son continues to receive the care and support he needs. If you’d like assistance drafting a complaint or demand letter, I can help prepare it. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

  - Timeline of your attempts to resolve the issue with GT Independence (e.g., emails, phone calls).

- **Issues with GT Independence:**

 Yes, I want this in an email. And my proof of the inconsistencies is that they paid invoices for us on November 7th from... I believe it was October. Now, if they're not allowed to back pay, they told me from... This was a new policy that they were implementing, although they never informed us of it. And they said that they just changed it. Then they would be violating that policy themselves. Further, I was told by the person at GT, who I think is called the RFS or the RSS, that she was going to go ahead and implement the spending plan as it was. And this was just last Friday when I talked to her. She talked to her supervisor and said, because it was no fault of mine that these delays happened, that they were going to honor it. But that I should wait until the things were in the system. When I looked in the system on Monday, I saw the funding was there, and I submitted invoices. After I submitted the invoices that afternoon, and I called GT to try to get the invoices looked at and paid, but I couldn't contact anyone. But I did receive an email moments later from the RSS saying what she had been saying before she changed their mind on Friday, that they weren't going to be able to back pay and that they wanted to restart the authorization from January 1st. Now, this seems like a threat to me to get me to accept this to me to get me to accept this under duress, because they're saying that they're going to try to get it going for January 1st, but they have to resubmit these things. It sounds like if I fight it or try something else and they're just not going to pay us. So this is all under duress. We moved into a facility in April, which has allowed us to continue our services in a more professional-like environment. It is a office warehouse type location building. And my landlord has sent me several threatening texts and things that I've been lying to him about not getting paid. And so he's now trashed our reputation as a company to the building management because I was subleasing from him. And they called me and said that they won't be renewing the building. And I said, I'm not going to renew it. I'm not going to renew it. And said that they won't be renewing our lease at the end of my sublease and that I have to move out in January. So already this has cost us dearly. So this place will no longer be an option for us to grow and to help Nicholas here or to to expand and help other people. My son is Nicholas Green. I can add the UCI number. His coordinator is Claudia Estelle Hernandez. The RSS or RFS over at GT Independence is Cushata. C-O-U-S-H-A-T-T-A. I don't quite recall her last name at the moment, but I can add that in.

Here’s a draft email for your complaint:

---

**Subject:** Formal Complaint Regarding GT Independence: Nonpayment of Authorized Services and Policy Inconsistencies  

**To:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Claudia Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), Cushata [Insert Last Name] (GT Independence Supervisor)

**CC:** [Your Email], Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate)

---

**Dear DDS Complaints Team, Regional Center Representatives, and GT Independence Supervisors,**

My name is [Your Full Name], and I am writing regarding an urgent issue with GT Independence's refusal to pay invoices for services provided to my son, Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]). Nicholas is served by Westside Regional Center under the Self-Determination Program (SDP).  

This situation has caused extreme hardship for my family and threatens the progress my son has made through years of dedicated work. Below, I outline the details and timeline of events to request immediate resolution, an investigation, and payment for services rendered.

---

**Summary of the Issue**  
1. **Authorization and Services Provided:**  
   - My son’s spending plan and authorization for services were approved, effective **October 1, 2024**.  
   - GT Independence was provided with the necessary documents to process invoices.  
   - Despite these approvals, GT Independence has refused to process payments for invoices submitted after November 7, 2024, citing a "new policy" disallowing backpay.  

2. **Policy Inconsistencies:**  
   - On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence paid invoices for services provided in October, contradicting their claimed new policy.  
   - On **Friday, December 6, 2024**, I spoke with the RSS, Cushata, who informed me GT Independence would process payments for October through December, as the delays were no fault of mine. She later reversed this decision after consulting her supervisor, claiming backpay was not allowed and suggesting restarting the authorization on **January 1, 2025.**  
   - These actions seem inconsistent, arbitrary, and retaliatory, effectively cutting off three months of funding.  

3. **Impact on My Family:**  
   - Without payment for services already rendered, I cannot pay rent on the facility where services are provided.  
   - My landlord has accused me of lying about payment delays, resulting in damaged reputation and a refusal to renew our sublease, forcing us to vacate in January 2025.  
   - This has not only disrupted Nicholas’ care but jeopardized our ability to serve others in the community through this facility.  

4. **Efforts to Resolve the Issue:**  
   - I have submitted all invoices and followed GT Independence’s instructions for documentation.  
   - Despite assurances from Cushata, GT Independence has delayed payments and attempted to change the authorization start date under duress.  

---

**Request for Immediate Action:**  
1. Payment of all outstanding invoices for services provided under the current authorization, which began **October 1, 2024.**  
2. Investigation into GT Independence’s refusal to honor approved authorizations and invoices, including their attempts to change policies retroactively and implement a new authorization to bypass responsibilities.  
3. Accountability for the financial and reputational harm caused to my family and our ability to provide services.  

---

**Supporting Documentation:**  
I have attached the following documents to this email:  
- The current spending plan and authorization details.  
- Copies of unpaid invoices.  
- Communication logs showing GT Independence’s inconsistent statements.  
- Evidence of financial harm, including communications from my landlord.  

---

This situation is dire. Without immediate resolution, my family will face eviction, and my son’s critical progress through the Self-Determination Program will be severely disrupted.  

I request an urgent review of this matter and am prepared to escalate to a fair hearing and legal action if necessary. Please let me know how to proceed.  

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Address]  
[Your Phone Number]  
[Your Email Address]

Let me know if you’d like any changes or additions before sending it! You should also call DDS and GT Independence after sending this to ensure they prioritize the matter.

---

 I don't want to send any attachments yet. I want to explain the story very clearly. Also, I want to make this a formal complaint, and I thought we were requesting a hearing or whatever is at the higher level. But if this is a preliminary step, okay. But the story is not correct as you mentioned it. I said that on Friday, because Shada spoke with her supervisor and approved the back payments. But on Tuesday or Monday, I actually sent out an email after I had sent in the invoices saying that she was not going to make back payments and that they were going to make the authorization for January 1st. I want to focus on the disruption to Nicholas's services and the inconsistencies that are occurring and GT's insistence on other changes in the preceding months with invoices and refusing to pay them, leading to our present situation with our facility as well as with them refusing to back pay invoices. Also, a very important issue is that I've had three different service coordinators in the last three years, and I had to initiate this year three spending plan to be put in place because I hadn't been contacted by anyone at the regional center. So in September, I began contacting them and asking them what was going on. Now, due to no fault of my own, they're telling me that Nicholas can't have his spending plan start on the date that it's supposed to start, and that's already authorized in their system. I will include statements from GT's portal, which show that the funding is already in their possession and that they can pay it immediately. October and November, and there's even one for December. I have those statements. So there's no reason why they shouldn't be paying them. Except that... there's something else going on... that conflicts with Nicholas's services.

---

Here's a revised draft focusing on your key points, making it clear and formal while highlighting the disruption to services, inconsistencies, and broader issues:

---

**Subject:** Formal Complaint Regarding GT Independence and Westside Regional Center: Disruption to Services and Inconsistent Payment Practices  

**To:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Claudia Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), Cushata [Insert Last Name] (GT Independence Supervisor)  
**CC:** [Your Email], Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate)  

---

**Dear DDS Complaints Team, Regional Center Representatives, and GT Independence Supervisors,**

My name is [Your Full Name], and I am submitting this formal complaint regarding the ongoing refusal of GT Independence to process payments for services already authorized and provided for my son, Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]), under the Self-Determination Program (SDP). This refusal, paired with policy inconsistencies and mismanagement, has caused severe disruption to Nicholas’s care, compromised our ability to provide services, and created a significant financial hardship for our family.  

---

### **Key Issues and Timeline of Events**  

1. **Disruption to Nicholas’s Services and Progress:**  
   - Nicholas has made remarkable progress in the two years since beginning the SDP. He has achieved a healthy weight, ceased aggressive behaviors, increased his communication abilities by 100%, and developed better social interactions, all without the use of pharmaceuticals.  
   - This progress is now at risk due to GT Independence's refusal to process payments for services that are authorized and listed in the Regional Center system as funded.  

2. **Policy Inconsistencies and Unfair Treatment:**  
   - On **Friday, December 6, 2024**, I spoke with the RSS at GT Independence, Cushata, who informed me that, after consulting her supervisor, she would honor payments for October through December, as the delays were due to no fault of my own.  
   - I submitted invoices on **Monday, December 9, 2024**, and later that day received an email from Cushata stating that GT Independence would no longer process back payments. Instead, they planned to restart the authorization on **January 1, 2025**, effectively eliminating three months of services.  
   - This reversal contradicts GT Independence’s earlier statements and actions, including their payment of invoices on **November 7, 2024**, for services rendered in October. If backpay is not allowed under a "new policy," then their prior payments also violate this policy.  

3. **Regional Center Mismanagement:**  
   - Nicholas has had **three different service coordinators** in the past three years. This inconsistency has left us to initiate and manage critical processes.  
   - I had to contact the Regional Center in **September 2024** to begin the process for Year 3 of Nicholas’s spending plan because no one reached out to us. The delay in processing the spending plan is no fault of ours, yet GT Independence now claims it cannot honor the approved start date of **October 1, 2024**, despite this being authorized in the system.  

4. **Facility and Financial Hardship:**  
   - Since **April 2024**, we have been renting a professional facility to provide a structured environment for Nicholas’s care and activities. Due to GT Independence’s refusal to pay invoices, I have fallen behind on rent, and my landlord has accused me of dishonesty about payments, damaging my reputation.  
   - The property management company has refused to renew our lease, forcing us to vacate in **January 2025**, and jeopardizing not only Nicholas’s services but our ability to expand and help others in similar situations.  

5. **Evidence of GT Independence’s Ability to Pay:**  
   - I have accessed GT Independence’s portal, which shows that the funding for Nicholas’s services is present and available for payment for October, November, and December. There is no legitimate reason for these delays other than a deliberate refusal to honor their obligations.  

---

### **Request for Action**  

Given the severity of the situation, I respectfully request the following:  
1. Immediate payment of all outstanding invoices for services provided under the approved authorization starting **October 1, 2024**.  
2. An investigation into GT Independence’s inconsistent practices, including their refusal to pay authorized invoices and attempts to retroactively change policies.  
3. Accountability for the harm caused to Nicholas’s services, progress, and our family due to their actions and the Regional Center’s lack of oversight.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

I am prepared to submit supporting documentation, including:  
- Proof of authorization and funding in GT Independence’s system.  
- Copies of unpaid invoices.  
- Communication logs showing GT Independence’s policy inconsistencies and delays.  
- Evidence of financial harm caused by nonpayment.  

I request a prompt response to this matter. If necessary, I will escalate to a Fair Hearing and seek legal action to ensure my son’s rights and services are protected.  

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. Please confirm receipt of this email and provide guidance on the next steps.

Let me know if there are further adjustments you'd like or if you’re ready to send this email.

---

 You said something about FMSs having a legal duty to be impartial or unconnected. What was that about?

---

FMS providers, like GT Independence, have a legal and ethical duty to act as neutral, impartial financial agents under the **Self-Determination Program (SDP)**. Their role is limited to managing and disbursing funds in accordance with the participant’s spending plan and authorized services. This neutrality ensures that the participant and their chosen service providers can operate without undue interference or influence.

Here’s the relevant information:

### **Role and Responsibilities of FMS Providers**
1. **Impartial Financial Agent:**  
   - FMS providers are not decision-makers in the services or supports included in the participant’s plan. Their job is to:
     - Process payments for authorized services.
     - Maintain financial records.
     - Ensure funds are used as directed in the spending plan.  

2. **Prohibited Practices:**
   - FMS providers cannot prioritize their own interests or act as service vendors in ways that conflict with their financial management responsibilities.  
   - They must not introduce administrative hurdles or policy changes that disadvantage the participant or their chosen service providers, especially retroactively.  

3. **Conflict of Interest Protections:**  
   - The **California Department of Developmental Services (DDS)** has established rules to prevent conflicts of interest in the SDP.  
   - If an FMS provider attempts to influence or restrict the participant’s ability to choose services or service providers, they are violating the principles of self-determination.

---

### **Potential Violations by GT Independence**
From your description, GT Independence may have violated their legal duties in the following ways:
1. **Undue Influence:**  
   - Their attempts to introduce retroactive policy changes and reauthorization processes appear to disadvantage you and your family. This could be seen as an attempt to exert undue influence or discourage your continued participation.  

2. **Conflict of Interest:**  
   - GT Independence’s actions may reflect a conflict of interest if they are trying to position themselves or their preferred vendors as service providers.  

3. **Failure to Follow Approved Plans:**  
   - By refusing to pay for services that are clearly authorized and documented, GT Independence is failing to meet their obligations as a neutral FMS provider.  

---

### **Legal Basis for Oversight and Complaint**
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) oversees FMS providers to ensure they:
- Adhere to state and federal regulations.
- Act in the best interest of the participant, without bias or personal gain.
- Facilitate the participant’s control over their spending plan and chosen services.

If you believe GT Independence is violating their obligations, you can file a formal complaint with DDS and cite these issues. It strengthens your case to mention that the FMS is breaching its legal duty to be impartial and is potentially engaging in practices that conflict with their role.

Let me know if you'd like this added explicitly to your email draft!

 Does my relationship violate any or cause any conflicts of interest or violate any of the policies?

---

Based on the information you’ve shared, your relationship does **not** appear to violate conflict-of-interest rules or policies under the Self-Determination Program (SDP). Here’s why:

---

### **1. Self-Determination Program Principles**
The Self-Determination Program (SDP) is designed to:
- Empower participants and their families to have full control over their spending plan.
- Allow participants to hire family members or trusted individuals as service providers, if it aligns with their goals and Individual Program Plan (IPP).  

The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) permits family members to provide services under SDP as long as:
- The services are approved in the spending plan.
- The family member or vendor complies with all applicable rules and guidelines.

---

### **2. No Conflict of Interest for You as a Parent**
You are legally allowed to:
- Be a vendor providing services to your son under SDP.
- Use the authorized funds in the spending plan to deliver those services, as long as the spending plan is approved by the Regional Center.  

There is **no inherent conflict of interest** in this relationship because:
- Your role as a vendor is clearly authorized.
- GT Independence, as the Financial Management Service (FMS), is responsible for managing payments—not deciding whether you can be a service provider.

---

### **3. GT Independence's Role as FMS**
The potential conflict of interest lies with GT Independence, not with you. As an FMS, they are obligated to act neutrally and cannot:
- Influence who you hire or discourage you from being a service provider.
- Create policies or practices that interfere with authorized services.  

---

### **4. Compliance on Your Part**
To ensure you are fully compliant with policies:
1. **Approved Services:** Make sure the services you are providing are explicitly outlined and approved in your son’s spending plan.  
2. **Proper Invoicing:** Submit clear and accurate invoices to GT Independence, detailing the services provided.  
3. **Adherence to Policies:** Follow any documentation requirements set by DDS or the Regional Center, provided they are reasonable and consistent.  

---

### **Conclusion**
Your relationship does not violate any conflict-of-interest policies under the SDP. You are well within your rights to be both an advocate for your son and a vendor delivering authorized services. If GT Independence or the Regional Center implies otherwise, they may be attempting to shift blame for their own delays or mismanagement.

Let me know if you’d like to emphasize this point in your formal complaint!

draft the complaint email please

Here is your revised and detailed complaint email draft:

---

**Subject:** Formal Complaint: Nonpayment and Policy Inconsistencies Threatening Services for Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number])  

**To:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Claudia Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), Cushata [Insert Last Name] (GT Independence Supervisor)  
**CC:** [Your Email], Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate)  

---

**Dear DDS Complaints Team, Regional Center Representatives, and GT Independence Supervisors,**  

My name is [Your Full Name], and I am submitting this formal complaint regarding the refusal of GT Independence to pay invoices for services provided to my son, Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]), under the Self-Determination Program (SDP). This refusal, paired with policy inconsistencies and mismanagement by GT Independence and the Regional Center, has severely disrupted Nicholas’s services, compromised his progress, and caused significant financial and emotional hardship to my family.  

---

### **Summary of the Situation**  

1. **Nicholas’s Progress and Services:**  
   Nicholas has made extraordinary progress in the two years since beginning the SDP, including significant health improvements, behavioral control, and increased social interaction. These gains are the result of carefully planned services outlined in his spending plan, which has been consistently approved by the Regional Center.  

2. **Authorization Delays Due to No Fault of Mine:**  
   - The current authorization for Nicholas’s services began on **October 1, 2024**, and was approved by the Regional Center. Despite this, I had to initiate contact with the Regional Center in **September 2024** because no service coordinator reached out to begin the process for Year 3 of Nicholas’s spending plan.  
   - The spending plan and authorization were delayed due to Regional Center mismanagement, not my actions.  

3. **Inconsistencies in GT Independence’s Policy and Actions:**  
   - On **Friday, December 6, 2024**, Cushata at GT Independence informed me that after consulting her supervisor, GT Independence would process payments for October through December, as the delays were not my fault.  
   - However, on **Monday, December 9, 2024**, after I submitted invoices for October, November, and December, I received an email from Cushata reversing this decision. She stated that GT Independence would not backpay and would instead seek to restart the authorization on **January 1, 2025**, effectively erasing three months of funding.  
   - This reversal contradicts their earlier assurances and their own actions, as they paid invoices for October services on **November 7, 2024**—despite claiming backpay is no longer allowed under a “new policy.”  

4. **Impact on Services and Facility:**  
   - Since **April 2024**, I have been renting a professional facility to provide a structured environment for Nicholas’s care. Due to GT Independence’s refusal to pay invoices, I am behind on rent, and my landlord has refused to renew our sublease, forcing us to vacate in **January 2025**.  
   - These actions have jeopardized not only Nicholas’s services but also my ability to provide care and expand support to others in similar situations.  

5. **Evidence of Available Funds:**  
   - GT Independence’s portal clearly shows funding for Nicholas’s services in October, November, and December. There is no legitimate reason for their refusal to pay.  

---

### **Key Concerns**  

1. **GT Independence’s Role and Conflict of Interest:**  
   As an FMS, GT Independence is required to act impartially. Their refusal to honor authorized payments, retroactive policy changes, and undue administrative demands appear to conflict with this obligation.  

2. **Regional Center Mismanagement:**  
   - Frequent changes in service coordinators (three in three years) and delays in initiating spending plans have caused unnecessary disruptions to Nicholas’s services.  
   - The Regional Center’s lack of oversight over GT Independence has allowed this situation to escalate.  

3. **Violation of SDP Principles:**  
   - The Self-Determination Program is designed to give participants and their families control over their services. GT Independence’s actions undermine these principles and threaten the progress Nicholas has made.  

---

### **Request for Action**  

I respectfully request the following:  
1. Immediate payment of all outstanding invoices for services provided under the current authorization, effective **October 1, 2024**.  
2. An investigation into GT Independence’s refusal to honor authorized payments, their policy inconsistencies, and potential conflict of interest.  
3. Accountability for the harm caused to Nicholas’s services, progress, and our family.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

I am prepared to provide the following documentation upon request:  
- Proof of authorization and funding in GT Independence’s system.  
- Copies of unpaid invoices.  
- Communication logs showing GT Independence’s inconsistent statements.  
- Evidence of financial harm, including communication from my landlord.  

This situation requires immediate attention to prevent further harm to Nicholas and our family. Please confirm receipt of this email and advise on the next steps.  

Sincerely,

Her name i Coushatta Seymour. Nicholas' worker is Claudia Estelle-Hernandez (an ally of sorts but dont throw her under the bus, she's the 3rd coordinator in as many years and is trying to help). My Name is Gary Green. Lets send a warning shot to all letting them know as we will be filing the formal complaint

---

Here is the updated draft with the corrected names and tone adjusted to serve as a "warning shot" before filing the formal complaint:

---

**Subject:** Notice of Intent to File Formal Complaint: Disruption to Services for Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number])  

**To:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Claudia Estelle-Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), Coushatta Seymour (GT Independence Supervisor)  
**CC:** [Your Email], Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate)

**Dear DDS Complaints Team, Regional Center Representatives, and GT Independence Supervisors,**  

My name is Gary Green, and I am writing regarding significant disruptions to services for my son, Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]), caused by delays and inconsistencies in payment processing by GT Independence. Despite authorized funding in place since **October 1, 2024**, services already provided to Nicholas remain unpaid. This has created severe financial hardship for my family and jeopardized the progress Nicholas has made under the Self-Determination Program (SDP).  

This email serves as a **notice of intent to file a formal complaint** if immediate action is not taken to resolve these issues.  

---

### **Summary of Issues**  

1. **Policy Inconsistencies:**  
   - On **Friday, December 6, 2024**, Coushatta Seymour at GT Independence informed me that after consulting her supervisor, GT Independence would process back payments for services rendered in October, November, and December, acknowledging that the delays were no fault of mine.  
   - However, on **Monday, December 9, 2024**, after I submitted invoices for these months, I received an email reversing this decision. I was told GT Independence would not process back payments and would instead seek to restart the authorization on **January 1, 2025**, effectively erasing three months of funding.  
   - This reversal directly contradicts GT Independence’s earlier assurances and their actions on **November 7, 2024**, when they processed invoices for services provided in October.  

2. **Harm to Nicholas’s Services and Progress:**  
   - Nicholas has made remarkable progress under the SDP, including significant improvements in health, behavior, and communication. The disruption caused by these payment delays threatens to undo this progress and compromises his care.  

3. **Facility and Financial Hardship:**  
   - Since **April 2024**, I have rented a professional facility to provide structured services for Nicholas. Due to unpaid invoices, I have fallen behind on rent, and my landlord has refused to renew our sublease. We are now forced to vacate in **January 2025**, creating further instability.  

4. **Regional Center Delays:**  
   - Nicholas has had three different service coordinators in the past three years, including Claudia Estelle-Hernandez, who has been trying to assist despite systemic challenges.  
   - I had to initiate the process for Nicholas’s Year 3 spending plan in **September 2024** due to lack of communication from the Regional Center. The delay in processing the spending plan is no fault of mine, yet GT Independence now claims it cannot honor the approved start date of **October 1, 2024**, despite the authorization being present in their system.  

---

### **Immediate Request for Action**  

To avoid escalation, I request the following:  
1. Immediate payment of all outstanding invoices for services rendered in October, November, and December 2024, as authorized in the spending plan.  
2. Acknowledgment that GT Independence’s reversal on back payments was inappropriate and contrary to their responsibilities as an impartial Financial Management Service (FMS).  
3. Confirmation that Nicholas’s services will not be interrupted or undermined by arbitrary policy changes.  

---

### **Notice of Formal Complaint**  

If these issues are not resolved promptly, I will file a formal complaint with the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) requesting:  
- An investigation into GT Independence’s inconsistent practices and potential conflict of interest.  
- A review of Regional Center oversight processes to ensure participants’ services are not jeopardized by administrative failures.  
- Accountability for the harm caused to Nicholas’s services and the financial hardship inflicted on our family.

This version maintains a firm tone while laying the groundwork for escalation. Let me know if you’re ready to send this or need further adjustments.

authorization is for 10/1, Gt received it 11/25. They had already refused to pay invoices for months leading up to october leaving funds in his plan from last year that were finally retroactively and partially paid on 11/7 for services in august/september. Also I intend to file the complaint asking for an audit into their payments and practices. 

---

Here’s your revised email, incorporating the updated details about authorization dates, retroactive payments, and your intent to request an audit:

---

**Subject:** Notice of Intent to File Formal Complaint: Disruption to Services and Request for Audit of GT Independence  

**To:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Claudia Estelle-Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), Coushatta Seymour (GT Independence Supervisor)  
**CC:** [Your Email], Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate)

**Dear DDS Complaints Team, Regional Center Representatives, and GT Independence Supervisors,**  

My name is Gary Green, and I am writing regarding significant disruptions to services for my son, Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]). These issues stem from delays and inconsistencies in payment processing by GT Independence, which have caused financial and emotional hardship for my family and jeopardized Nicholas’s progress under the Self-Determination Program (SDP).  

This email serves as a **notice of intent to file a formal complaint and request an audit of GT Independence’s payment practices** if immediate action is not taken to address these issues.  

---

### **Key Facts and Issues**  

1. **Authorization and Delays in Payment:**  
   - Nicholas’s spending plan for Year 3 was authorized effective **October 1, 2024**, and GT Independence received the authorization on **November 25, 2024**. Despite this, they have refused to pay invoices for services provided from October onward.  
   - Leading up to October, GT Independence had already delayed payments for services provided in August and September, leaving funds unused in Nicholas’s spending plan from last year. After months of nonpayment, GT Independence retroactively and partially paid for these services on **November 7, 2024.**  
   - Now, GT Independence claims they cannot backpay invoices for October through December 2024, citing a “new policy,” even though funds are present and available in their system for these months.  

2. **Inconsistent Policy and Practices:**  
   - On **Friday, December 6, 2024**, Coushatta Seymour at GT Independence informed me that they would honor back payments for October, November, and December services, as the delays were not my fault.  
   - However, on **Monday, December 9, 2024**, after I submitted invoices for these months, Coushatta reversed this decision, claiming that back payments were not allowed and proposing to restart the authorization on **January 1, 2025.**  
   - This reversal contradicts GT Independence’s previous assurances and their retroactive payments made for August/September on **November 7, 2024.**  

3. **Impact on Services and Facility:**  
   - Nicholas has made remarkable progress under the SDP, including improvements in health, behavior, and communication. The disruption caused by delayed payments threatens to undo this progress and jeopardizes his care.  
   - Since **April 2024**, I have rented a professional facility to provide structured services for Nicholas. Due to unpaid invoices, I have fallen behind on rent, and my landlord has refused to renew our sublease. We are now forced to vacate in **January 2025**, creating further instability.  

4. **Regional Center Delays and Oversight:**  
   - Nicholas’s Year 3 spending plan was delayed because I had to initiate contact in **September 2024**, as no one from the Regional Center reached out to start the process. These delays were beyond my control.  
   - Frequent changes in service coordinators (three in three years) have further contributed to administrative delays and confusion, yet GT Independence is unfairly penalizing Nicholas by refusing to honor the authorized start date of **October 1, 2024.**  

---

### **Request for Action**  

To resolve these issues, I request:  
1. Immediate payment of all outstanding invoices for services rendered in October, November, and December 2024, as authorized in the spending plan.  
2. An audit of GT Independence’s payment practices, specifically to investigate:  
   - Their refusal to pay authorized invoices within a reasonable timeframe.  
   - Their inconsistent application of policies regarding back payments.  
   - Potential conflicts of interest or administrative failures contributing to delays.  
3. Confirmation that Nicholas’s services will not be interrupted due to these delays or arbitrary policy changes.  

---

### **Notice of Formal Complaint**  

If these issues are not resolved promptly, I will file a formal complaint with the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) requesting:  
- An independent audit of GT Independence’s practices.  
- A review of Regional Center oversight processes to ensure participants’ services are protected.  
- Accountability for the harm caused to Nicholas’s services and the financial hardship inflicted on our family.

This version incorporates the history of delayed payments, the new policy, and your request for an audit. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to include or adjust!

---

no the inconsistencies are with them paying the retoactive in Nov but claiming a policy had been in place for Oct. I am filing regardless, not if they dont pay. The audit is to see if they are lying about retro payments or being arbitrary. Every year the authorization has been late and never have they done this. they did not prewarn of this (another inconsistency). Next step is state council on Disability (as you mentioned)

---

Here’s the revised version of the complaint email, making it clear you are filing regardless of payment, emphasizing the inconsistencies in retroactive payments and policy changes, and requesting an audit:

---

**Subject:** Formal Complaint and Request for Audit of GT Independence: Disruption to Services for Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number])  

**To:** DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Claudia Estelle-Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), Coushatta Seymour (GT Independence Supervisor)  
**CC:** [Your Email], Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate)  

---

**Dear DDS Complaints Team, Regional Center Representatives, and GT Independence Supervisors,**  

My name is Gary Green, and I am filing this **formal complaint and request for an audit** of GT Independence’s payment practices. Their inconsistent application of policies and refusal to process payments for authorized services under my son Nicholas Green’s (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]) Self-Determination Program (SDP) has caused severe disruption to his care and created significant financial hardship for my family.  

This complaint is submitted with a formal request for an investigation into GT Independence’s actions, including their handling of retroactive payments and adherence to policies.  

---

### **Key Issues and Inconsistencies**  

1. **Authorization and Delayed Payments:**  
   - Nicholas’s spending plan for Year 3 was authorized effective **October 1, 2024**, and received by GT Independence on **November 25, 2024**.  
   - GT Independence has refused to pay invoices for services provided since October, despite the authorization being active and visible in their system.  

2. **Retroactive Payment Contradictions:**  
   - On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence processed retroactive payments for services rendered in August and September. However, they now claim a “policy” disallowing retroactive payments has been in place since **October 2024.**  
   - This inconsistency raises serious concerns about whether GT Independence is applying its policies arbitrarily or misrepresenting the rules.  

3. **Failure to Provide Notice of Policy Changes:**  
   - GT Independence failed to notify me of any policy change prior to October 1, 2024. Every year, authorizations have been delayed, yet retroactive payments were processed without issue. The sudden implementation of this “policy” in October, without prior warning, is yet another inconsistency.  

4. **Impact on Nicholas’s Services:**  
   - Nicholas’s services are critical to maintaining the remarkable progress he has made under the SDP, including improvements in health, behavior, and communication. The refusal to process payments threatens to undo this progress and compromises his care.  

5. **Facility and Financial Hardship:**  
   - Since **April 2024**, I have rented a professional facility to provide structured services for Nicholas. GT Independence’s refusal to pay invoices has left me unable to pay rent, forcing us to vacate in **January 2025.**  

---

### **Request for Immediate Action**  

I request the following:  
1. **Audit of GT Independence’s Payment Practices:**  
   - Investigate their inconsistent handling of retroactive payments and the arbitrary implementation of policies.  
   - Determine whether GT Independence is acting in good faith or engaging in practices that unfairly disadvantage families like mine.  

2. **Immediate Payment of Outstanding Invoices:**  
   - All services rendered under the authorization starting **October 1, 2024** must be paid promptly.  

3. **Confirmation of Policy Consistency:**  
   - Provide clarity on GT Independence’s policies regarding retroactive payments and ensure these policies are applied consistently.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

This complaint is being submitted to the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and the Westside Regional Center. I will also escalate this issue to the **State Council on Developmental Disabilities** to ensure oversight of GT Independence and the Regional Center’s handling of this matter.  

I expect a prompt response and resolution to this complaint. Please confirm receipt of this email and provide guidance on the next steps.  

Sincerely,

This version clarifies your intent to file regardless of payment, requests an audit explicitly, and includes the next step of involving the State Council. Let me know if you need further tweaks or are ready to send this.

---

this isnt the complaint. Again this is to GT as an attempt to spur payment

---

Here’s a revised **warning email** addressed to GT Independence, designed to spur payment while laying the groundwork for your formal complaint. It emphasizes inconsistencies, requests immediate resolution, and warns of further action.

---

**Subject:** Urgent: Request for Immediate Payment of Authorized Services for Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number])  

**To:** Coushatta Seymour (GT Independence Supervisor)  
**CC:** Claudia Estelle-Hernandez (Westside Regional Center), DDSComplaints@dds.ca.gov, Matt Alivio (OCRA Advocate), [Your Email]  

---

**Dear Coushatta Seymour,**  

I am writing regarding the ongoing delays and refusal by GT Independence to process payments for services provided to my son, Nicholas Green (UCI#: [Insert UCI Number]), under the Self-Determination Program (SDP). These delays have caused significant financial hardship and jeopardized the progress Nicholas has made through his authorized services.  

Your actions appear inconsistent with GT Independence’s stated policies and responsibilities, and I am requesting **immediate resolution** of this matter before I proceed with filing formal complaints and requesting audits of your payment practices.  

---

### **Key Facts and Inconsistencies**  

1. **Authorized Funding Already in Your System:**  
   - Nicholas’s Year 3 spending plan was authorized effective **October 1, 2024**, and received by GT Independence on **November 25, 2024.**  
   - Funding for services provided in October, November, and December 2024 is clearly present in your system, yet invoices for these months remain unpaid.  

2. **Contradictory Retroactive Payment Practices:**  
   - On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence processed retroactive payments for services provided in August and September. However, you now claim that retroactive payments have been disallowed since **October 2024** under a “new policy.”  
   - This inconsistency raises concerns about whether your policies are being applied fairly or arbitrarily.  

3. **Failure to Notify of Policy Changes:**  
   - GT Independence failed to notify me of any policy change before October 1, 2024. Previous delays in authorizations have always been resolved with retroactive payments, yet this year, the process has suddenly and unjustly changed.  

4. **Reversal of Assurances:**  
   - On **Friday, December 6, 2024**, you assured me that back payments for October through December would be honored, as the delays were no fault of mine. However, on **Monday, December 9, 2024**, this decision was reversed, and I was told GT Independence would not process back payments and intended to restart the authorization on **January 1, 2025.**  

5. **Severe Impact on Services:**  
   - These payment delays threaten to disrupt Nicholas’s services and progress. They have also caused significant financial harm, as I cannot pay rent for the professional facility where these services are provided, forcing us to vacate in **January 2025.**  

---

### **Request for Immediate Action**  

To resolve this matter, I request that GT Independence:  
1. Process all outstanding invoices for services provided in October, November, and December 2024 immediately, as these were authorized under the approved spending plan.  
2. Provide written confirmation of payment and clarity regarding your policies on retroactive payments.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will proceed with the following actions:  
- Filing a **formal complaint** with the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) requesting an investigation into GT Independence’s payment practices and inconsistencies.  
- Submitting a request to the **State Council on Developmental Disabilities** for oversight and audit of your handling of authorized payments.  

GT Independence’s actions to date are inconsistent with the principles of the Self-Determination Program and have caused undue harm to my family. I urge you to resolve this matter immediately to avoid escalation.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

respond to this email and I suspect the instructions are coming from above her. Be nice. : Good afternoon everyone,

 

We will have to do a new enrollment for Nicholas Green because we do not have the POS in the system for the new year. I know that the regional center released it on 11/25 however, it can take a couple of weeks for it to get into our system. We would not need to do new paperwork however, we would need the authorization that started on 10/1/2024 changed to 1/1/2025. It can still end  9/30/2025.  We will not be able to back pay from 10/1/2024.

 

 

Kindly,

 

 

Coushatta Seymore
Field Service Representative

Here’s a polite but firm response that addresses the situation and emphasizes your points without being confrontational:

---

**Subject:** Clarification on Nicholas Green’s Authorization and Request for Payment  

**Dear Coushatta Seymore,**  

Thank you for your email and for explaining GT Independence’s current position regarding Nicholas Green’s authorization. I appreciate your efforts to address this matter. However, I must express concern about the proposed change to the authorization start date and the refusal to process back payments for services provided under the approved spending plan.  

Nicholas’s spending plan for Year 3 was authorized with a start date of **October 1, 2024**, as confirmed by the Regional Center, and GT Independence received it on **November 25, 2024.** While I understand there may be internal delays in processing authorizations, these delays are beyond my control and should not impact services that have already been provided and documented.  

### **Request for Resolution**  

I kindly request that GT Independence:  
1. Process the outstanding invoices for services provided in October, November, and December 2024, as the funding is already present in your system.  
2. Reconsider the proposal to change the authorization start date to **January 1, 2025,** which would negate three months of services that were authorized and provided in good faith.  

If internal delays have caused the current situation, I trust GT Independence will work with the Regional Center to resolve it without penalizing Nicholas or jeopardizing his services. I also suspect that these decisions may be coming from above your level, and I appreciate any support you can provide in advocating for a resolution that honors the approved spending plan and services already rendered.  

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your response and a swift resolution to this matter.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green  
[Your Contact Information]

This response is polite, keeps the door open for collaboration, and highlights the unfairness of the situation without directly blaming the field service representative. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!

---

you need to resonod with the facts of the harm as you laid out in the complaint. They need a preview and a nice warning shot

---

Here’s a revised response that incorporates the facts of the harm while maintaining a professional and polite tone, giving them a clear "warning shot" without direct confrontation:

---

**Subject:** Clarification and Request for Immediate Resolution: Nicholas Green’s Authorization and Payment  

**Dear Coushatta Seymore,**  

Thank you for your email explaining GT Independence’s current position regarding Nicholas Green’s authorization. I appreciate your efforts to address this situation, but I must express serious concern about the proposed changes and the decision to refuse back payments for services provided under the approved spending plan.  

As you know, Nicholas’s spending plan for Year 3 was authorized with a start date of **October 1, 2024**, and GT Independence received this authorization on **November 25, 2024.** While I understand internal processing delays can occur, the refusal to backpay for these services—when funding is present and available—creates significant and unnecessary harm to Nicholas’s services and to my family.  

### **Key Points of Concern**  

1. **Proposed Authorization Changes:**  
   Changing the authorization start date to **January 1, 2025** effectively negates three months of authorized services that were rendered in good faith. This proposal disregards the existing authorization and places the burden of internal delays on Nicholas and our family.  

2. **Impact on Services and Progress:**  
   Nicholas has made extraordinary progress under the Self-Determination Program (SDP), including improved health, communication, and behavior. Delayed payments jeopardize these services, threatening to undo years of work and progress.  

3. **Financial and Reputational Harm:**  
   Due to unpaid invoices, I have fallen behind on rent for the professional facility where Nicholas receives services. This has damaged my reputation with the landlord, and I have been forced to vacate the space in **January 2025.** Such disruptions are directly tied to the refusal to process payments for services that were authorized and provided.  

4. **Inconsistencies in Retroactive Payments:**  
   On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence retroactively paid for services provided in August and September 2024, despite now claiming that a “no backpay” policy has been in place since **October 2024.** This inconsistency raises concerns about the fair and consistent application of policies and processes.  

---

### **Request for Resolution**  

To avoid further harm, I kindly request that GT Independence:  
1. Process the outstanding invoices for services provided in October, November, and December 2024, as authorized and funded under the current spending plan.  
2. Refrain from modifying the authorization start date to **January 1, 2025,** as this would unfairly penalize Nicholas and disrupt services that have already been rendered in good faith.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

While I remain hopeful for a swift resolution, please understand that I will pursue all available remedies if this matter is not resolved promptly. This includes filing a formal complaint with the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and requesting an audit of GT Independence’s payment practices to ensure transparency and fairness.  

I hope this matter can be resolved quickly and collaboratively, and I appreciate any efforts you can make to advocate for Nicholas’s services. Thank you for your time and attention.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

I absolutely will. This is a violation of the Lanterman Act and I am preparing a formal complaint to send to DDS and the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, a request for an expedited (emergency) Fair Hearing, as well as an investigation into GT Independence’s practices regarding their dual role as FMS and vendor, and their administrative handling of invoices.. 

It is clear that GT Independence as an FMS and vendor for regional center is in violation of their requirement to be neutral. They have a potential conflict of interest. They have repeatedly denied payment on invoices citing their new rules, causing a hardship that I will explain in further detail in my complaint. 

They are prohibited from introducing administrative hurdles or policy changes that disadvantage the participant or their chosen service providers, especially retroactively. But this is what is happening. 

I have spent the last seventeen years of my life educating, advocating, and preparing to do this work only. My B.A. and two Masters degrees from UCLA in that time have focused on autism advocacy, education, and designing effective interventions. The proof in in Nicholas' progress over the last three years since being under my sole care. It's hard to believe that a financial management service hired to (1) Process payments for authorized services, (2) Maintain financial records, and (3) Ensure funds are used as directed in the spending plan- would be so powerful as to override DDS policies. 

I will cc you on everything.

Thanks Claudia. 

Best,
Gary

Here’s the revised response incorporating your reasoning and outlining the stakes, while maintaining a polite but firm tone to Claudia and Coushatta:

---

**Subject:** Immediate Clarification and Request for Payment: Nicholas Green’s Authorization  

**Dear Claudia and Coushatta,**  

Thank you for your recent updates regarding Nicholas Green’s authorization and the proposed changes to the start date. I appreciate your continued efforts to address this matter; however, I must strongly oppose any alteration to the start date of Nicholas’s spending plan from **October 1, 2024** to **January 1, 2025.** This change not only contradicts the approved authorization but also undermines the integrity of services already rendered and funded.  

---

### **Key Issues and Concerns**  

1. **Violation of the Lanterman Act and Participant Rights:**  
   Under the Lanterman Act, participants in the Self-Determination Program (SDP) are entitled to control their spending plans and choose their service providers. Retroactively changing an approved authorization disadvantages Nicholas and unfairly penalizes our family for delays outside of our control.  

2. **Inconsistencies and Hardship Caused by GT Independence’s Policies:**  
   - On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence retroactively processed payments for services in August and September. Yet now, the FMS claims a "no backpay" policy has been in effect since **October 2024,** despite failing to notify participants or service providers of this change.  
   - GT Independence’s refusal to process payments for October through December services has caused severe financial hardship, jeopardizing Nicholas’s progress and forcing us to vacate the facility where his services are provided.  

3. **GT Independence’s Role and Neutrality:**  
   As both a Financial Management Service (FMS) and vendor, GT Independence has a legal duty to act impartially and without conflicts of interest. Their actions—introducing administrative hurdles, refusing retroactive payments, and proposing changes to authorized dates—appear to violate this duty and raise questions about their adherence to DDS policies.  

---

### **Nicholas’s Progress at Stake**  

Nicholas has made extraordinary progress since entering the SDP, including:  
- Losing over 100 pounds and maintaining a healthy weight.  
- Completely stopping aggressive behaviors.  
- Increasing communication skills by over 100%.  
These gains are a direct result of services outlined in his spending plan and should not be jeopardized by administrative errors or arbitrary policy changes.  

---

### **Request for Immediate Resolution**  

To avoid further harm to Nicholas’s services, I respectfully request the following:  
1. GT Independence must process all outstanding invoices for services provided in October, November, and December 2024, as authorized and funded under the approved spending plan.  
2. The start date of Nicholas’s Year 3 authorization must remain **October 1, 2024,** as originally approved, with no retroactive changes.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

While I remain hopeful for a resolution, I am preparing a formal complaint to submit to the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and the State Council on Developmental Disabilities. This complaint will include:  
- A request for an expedited (emergency) Fair Hearing.  
- A detailed report on the hardship caused by GT Independence’s policies.  
- A request for an audit of GT Independence’s practices as both an FMS and vendor, including an investigation into potential conflicts of interest and their handling of retroactive payments.  

Claudia, I understand you are working to assist in resolving this matter, and I appreciate your support. I will keep you copied on all related correspondence. Coushatta, I hope GT Independence can act quickly to resolve these issues and avoid escalation.  

Thank you both for your time and attention.  

Best regards,

This version emphasizes the harm, provides a clear summary of the stakes, and gives a firm but professional preview of your next steps if the issue isn’t resolved. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!

you left out the important endorsement of our credentials and preparation for this moment in history whis is now being threatened. Its important because I think they assume we are not the qualified ones and Gt could push us out as vendors. but i have solid grounds for putting together this program and running this facility, including PHD work with Connie Kasari, who knows me and has discussed Nicholas and his condition and collaborated in treatment designs

---

Here’s the revised response, including the important context about your credentials and preparation, emphasizing your qualifications to manage Nicholas’s care and the legitimacy of your role as a vendor:

---

**Subject:** Immediate Clarification and Request for Payment: Nicholas Green’s Authorization  

**Dear Claudia and Coushatta,**  

Thank you for your recent updates regarding Nicholas Green’s authorization and the proposed changes to the start date. I appreciate your continued efforts to address this matter. However, I must strongly oppose any alteration to the start date of Nicholas’s spending plan from **October 1, 2024** to **January 1, 2025.** This proposed change undermines the services already rendered, jeopardizes Nicholas’s progress, and disregards the work and credentials that have gone into creating the program that supports him so effectively.  

---

### **Our Preparedness and Commitment to Nicholas’s Care**  

Over the last seventeen years, I have dedicated my life to becoming the most qualified advocate, caregiver, and service provider for my son. My educational and professional background, including:  
- A **Bachelor’s Degree** and two **Master’s Degrees** from UCLA focused on autism advocacy, education, and intervention design,  
- Extensive field experience working with autism communities, and  
- Ph.D. work under the guidance of Dr. Connie Kasari, a leading expert in autism research, with whom I have discussed and collaborated on treatment designs for Nicholas,  

has equipped me to create the highly effective program that has yielded extraordinary results for Nicholas in the last three years.  

The professional facility I established for his care represents years of planning and preparation. It is not merely a space—it is a carefully crafted environment, grounded in evidence-based practices, that has supported Nicholas in achieving:  
- A 100+ pound weight loss and sustained healthy living.  
- The complete cessation of aggressive behaviors.  
- A 100% increase in his communication abilities and social skills.  

This is the result of specialized care, which I have provided as a fully authorized and legitimate vendor. These gains should not be jeopardized by administrative delays or retroactive policy changes.  

---

### **Key Concerns and Issues**  

1. **Authorization and Payment Delays:**  
   - Nicholas’s spending plan for Year 3 was authorized to start **October 1, 2024**, and GT Independence received this authorization on **November 25, 2024.**  
   - Despite this, GT Independence has refused to pay invoices for October, November, and December services, even though the funding is present and available in your system.  

2. **Inconsistencies in Retroactive Payments:**  
   - On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence retroactively processed payments for services provided in August and September. Yet, now it is claimed that a “no backpay” policy has been in place since **October 2024.**  
   - This inconsistency raises concerns about arbitrary policy application and GT Independence’s commitment to fair and impartial practices.  

3. **Impact on Services and Financial Hardship:**  
   - The refusal to process payments has created severe financial hardship, forcing me to vacate the professional facility where Nicholas receives care in **January 2025.**  
   - This disruption undermines the work and investment that has gone into creating a highly effective program tailored to Nicholas’s needs.  

4. **Neutrality of GT Independence:**  
   - As both an FMS and vendor, GT Independence has a legal duty to act impartially. By introducing retroactive policy changes, delaying payments, and proposing an arbitrary change to the authorization start date, GT Independence appears to violate this duty.  

---

### **Request for Immediate Resolution**  

I respectfully request the following:  
1. **Immediate Payment:** Process all outstanding invoices for services provided in October, November, and December 2024, as authorized under the current spending plan.  
2. **Preservation of Authorization Start Date:** Maintain the approved start date of **October 1, 2024,** ensuring services already rendered are fully accounted for.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

While I remain hopeful for a swift resolution, I must also prepare for further steps if necessary. I will be submitting a formal complaint to the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, including:  
- A request for an expedited Fair Hearing to address the harm caused by delayed payments.  
- A detailed account of the hardship caused by GT Independence’s inconsistencies.  
- A request for an audit of GT Independence’s practices as both an FMS and vendor to ensure compliance with DDS policies and neutrality standards.  

Claudia, I appreciate your efforts to assist in resolving this issue, and I will keep you copied on all related correspondence. Coushatta, I trust that you will take this opportunity to ensure fairness and prompt resolution.  

Thank you both for your attention to this matter.

further qualification and relevant work/insight: in 2020 I was hired by UCCED and USC childrens hospital as a Research Consultant on a DDS funded study led by Dr. Olga Solomon into lack of utilization of services for african american families. We found that such practices of creating administrative hurdles was a major contributing factor. We are now experiencing as an African american client what I studied as a researcher.

Here’s the revised response, incorporating your additional qualifications and firsthand insight into the systemic issues identified in your research:

**Subject:** Immediate Clarification and Request for Payment: Nicholas Green’s Authorization  

**Dear Claudia and Coushatta,**  

Thank you for your recent updates regarding Nicholas Green’s authorization and the proposed changes to the start date. I appreciate your efforts to address this matter, but I must firmly oppose any alteration to the start date of Nicholas’s spending plan from **October 1, 2024** to **January 1, 2025.** Such a change disregards the approved authorization, undermines services already rendered, and introduces administrative hurdles that negatively impact African American clients—something I have not only studied but am now experiencing firsthand.  

---

### **Our Preparedness and Commitment to Nicholas’s Care**  

Over the last seventeen years, I have dedicated my life to becoming a qualified advocate, caregiver, and service provider for my son. My background includes:

- Ph.D. work at UCLA under Dr. Connie Kasari, a leading expert in autism research, with whom I have discussed and collaborated on treatment designs for Nicholas.  
- Work as a **Research Consultant** in 2020 with the **USC Children’s Hospital** and **UCCED (University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities)** on a DDS-funded study led by Dr. Olga Solomon. This study specifically examined barriers to service utilization among African American families, identifying practices like introducing administrative hurdles as significant contributing factors.  

The professional facility I established for Nicholas’s care represents years of planning, preparation, and investment. It is a carefully designed environment grounded in evidence-based practices, and it has supported Nicholas in achieving:  
- A 100+ pound weight loss and sustained healthy living.  
- The complete cessation of aggressive behaviors.  
- A 100% increase in his communication abilities and social skills.  

These gains are a direct result of services provided under his approved spending plan. To threaten these gains due to administrative delays and retroactive policy changes is not only unjust but emblematic of the systemic barriers I studied as a researcher.

### **Key Issues and Concerns**  

1. **Authorization and Payment Delays:**  
   - Nicholas’s spending plan for Year 3 was authorized effective **October 1, 2024**, and GT Independence received it on **November 25, 2024.** Despite this, invoices for October, November, and December remain unpaid, even though funding is available in your system.  

2. **Inconsistencies in Retroactive Payments:**  
   - On **November 7, 2024**, GT Independence retroactively processed payments for August and September services. However, it is now claimed that a “no backpay” policy has been in place since **October 2024.**  
   - This inconsistency raises concerns about arbitrary policy application and potential bias in how rules are enforced.  

3. **Systemic Barriers to African American Families:**  
   - As identified in the DDS-funded study I worked on in 2020, practices such as introducing administrative hurdles disproportionately impact African American families and contribute to underutilization of services. This is now playing out in my own experience as an African American client, despite my extensive qualifications and preparation to support my son.  

4. **Impact on Services and Financial Harm:**  
   - The refusal to process payments has forced me to vacate the facility where Nicholas receives care in **January 2025,** creating unnecessary instability and disrupting the progress he has worked so hard to achieve.  

5. **Neutrality of GT Independence:**  
   - As both an FMS and vendor, GT Independence is required to act impartially. By introducing retroactive policy changes, delaying payments, and proposing to alter authorization dates, GT Independence appears to violate this duty and undermine the principles of the Self-Determination Program (SDP).

Okay, let's shift gears a bit to add a permanent defense and countersuit for my landlord who has now sent me a letter that they will be evicting me. He has accused me of fraud and not paying rent. His name is Ryan Emmons. He is the CEO of Waikia Water. And I want to not only mount a defense, but I want to personally sue him for slandering me to the management company, which is Link Parks, and for defamation for trying to get them to believe that I am fraudulent. I have fraudulently rented this place and have been lying to him and had no intention of paying, which is what he accused me of. About a week ago or two weeks ago, I received a phone call from the leasing manager, Jennifer Gray, who had been very eager to get me into either another unit that was more appropriate for me or to renew my lease in this unit. She abruptly called me and said, you will not be renewing your lease and you need to be out by the end of your sub-lease. This is a result of Ryan Emmons sending emails to Link Parks, which I was told about by his insurance agent, I mean his real estate agent, who leased me the place, Andrew. Now, when I first saw the place, Andrew told me that the roll-up doors were a part of it. In fact, he texted me, go ahead and knock on those doors and they'll open it. Well, no one opened those doors and I had to enter through another entrance, which I found much later after leasing the place that that section is not even a part of my unit. But once inside, Ryan represented to me that it was and that they had just decided to put a small wall in front of it and that the management could take that down without a problem at my request and I could use the roll-up door. It was him who misrepresented the space and was fraudulent. And now that DDS, Regional Center, and GT Independence have emailed me and accepted the authorization date of 10-1 and said they are back paying and are now reviewing my invoices to pay them, which coincides with the date that I told Ryan, December 1st, that I was going to renew my lease. And so, instead of me lying or being a fraud, I'm in line with every promise they made to me about timelines and pay dates. They didn't come to fruition because of the situation that we have. So, his defaming me, calling me a fraud, a liar, has been very harmful to my business and has given us a bad reputation and has even caused us harm and damages that we cannot continue to do business with Link Parks, who is owned by DDS. BlackRock... ...owns basically everything.

---



---

Here’s a detailed outline of your potential **defense and countersuit strategy** against Ryan Emmons for eviction, slander, and defamation:

---

### **1. Mounting a Defense Against Eviction**  
To defend against the eviction notice, focus on **contractual rights**, **misrepresentations**, and proof of your efforts to pay rent despite delays caused by external circumstances (GT Independence and DDS).  

#### Key Steps:  
1. **Review Your Lease Agreement:**  
   - Identify terms about rent payment timelines, lease renewals, and unit modifications (e.g., use of roll-up doors).  
   - Check for any clauses Ryan Emmons or Link Parks may have violated, such as misrepresenting the unit or retaliatory actions.

2. **Document Your Rent Payment Attempts:**  
   - Gather all communications (emails, texts, letters) proving your intent and ability to pay rent as soon as payments from DDS were processed.  
   - Provide a timeline showing when GT Independence delayed payments and when you informed Ryan of these delays.  

3. **Expose Misrepresentations by Ryan Emmons:**  
   - Document Ryan's statements about the roll-up doors and unit layout (e.g., texts, emails, verbal agreements witnessed by others).  
   - Include Andrew’s representations about the unit's features and functionality.  

4. **Claim Retaliatory Eviction (if applicable):**  
   - If Ryan’s eviction notice came shortly after you notified him of payment updates and your intent to renew, argue that this is a retaliatory eviction under landlord-tenant law.  

5. **Prepare for Court:**  
   - File a **written response to the eviction notice** with the local court within the required timeline (often 5-15 days after receiving the notice).  
   - Include evidence of your lease agreement, payment history, and correspondence with DDS and GT Independence showing payment delays were beyond your control.  

---

### **2. Countersuit for Defamation and Slander**  

#### Grounds for the Countersuit:  
1. **Defamation:**  
   - Ryan Emmons allegedly defamed you by making false statements to Link Parks management (e.g., calling you fraudulent or accusing you of lying about your intent to pay rent).  
   - These statements damaged your reputation and business relationships, as evidenced by Jennifer Gray’s abrupt change in tone and decision not to renew your lease.  

2. **Slander (Verbal Statements):**  
   - If Ryan verbally accused you of fraud or dishonesty to others, such as Link Parks management or others in the building, this constitutes slander.  

3. **Fraudulent Misrepresentation:**  
   - Ryan misrepresented the roll-up doors and unit layout when leasing the space, causing you to enter into a lease under false pretenses.  

#### Key Evidence to Support Your Claim:  
1. **Proof of Defamatory Statements:**  
   - Request a copy of any emails Ryan sent to Link Parks that contain false claims.  
   - Document the abrupt change in tone from Jennifer Gray and her statements about Ryan’s emails influencing their decision.  

2. **Damage to Your Business Reputation:**  
   - Provide evidence of how Ryan’s statements harmed your ability to do business with Link Parks and any loss of revenue, clients, or opportunities caused by this harm.  

3. **Misrepresentation of the Unit:**  
   - Include texts, emails, or statements from Andrew or Ryan about the roll-up doors being part of the unit.  
   - Highlight the discrepancy between their representations and the actual layout of the unit.  

4. **Proof of Good Faith Efforts:**  
   - Show your correspondence with DDS, GT Independence, and the Regional Center confirming payment dates and your adherence to these timelines.  

---

### **3. Damages to Claim in Your Countersuit**  

#### **Economic Damages:**  
- Loss of business reputation and opportunities caused by Ryan’s defamatory statements.  
- Costs associated with finding and relocating to a new facility.  

#### **Non-Economic Damages:**  
- Emotional distress caused by the false accusations and harm to your reputation.  

#### **Punitive Damages:**  
- If Ryan’s actions are found to be intentional, malicious, or in bad faith, you can request punitive damages to deter similar behavior.  

---

### **4. Legal Steps for Your Defense and Countersuit**  

1. **File a Response to the Eviction Notice:**  
   - Respond to the eviction notice within the legally required timeframe.  
   - Attach evidence supporting your claim that you are not in breach of the lease and that Ryan’s actions are retaliatory and harmful.  

2. **Send a Cease-and-Desist Letter:**  
   - Draft and send a letter to Ryan Emmons demanding that he stop making defamatory statements about you and retract any false claims.  

3. **File a Countersuit:**  
   - Prepare and file a countersuit for defamation, slander, and fraudulent misrepresentation in small claims or civil court, depending on the damages sought.  

4. **Subpoena Emails from Link Parks Management:**  
   - Request all communications from Ryan Emmons to Link Parks management about you or your lease to prove defamation and misrepresentation.  

5. **Consider Mediation:**  
   - If possible, suggest mediation to settle disputes outside of court. This could expedite resolution and save costs.  

---

### **Draft Cease-and-Desist Letter (Optional First Step)**  

**Subject:** Cease-and-Desist Notice: Defamation and Retaliatory Actions  

**Dear Mr. Emmons,**  

I am writing to formally demand that you cease making defamatory statements about me and my business to Link Parks management or any other parties. Your accusations of fraud and dishonesty are not only false but have caused significant harm to my reputation and business.  

Your actions, including misrepresenting the terms of my lease and making untrue statements to Link Parks, have resulted in undue stress, financial harm, and a tarnished reputation. Furthermore, your misrepresentation of the unit’s features during the leasing process raises serious concerns about your own conduct.  

Should you continue to make false or defamatory statements about me, or should you proceed with retaliatory actions, I will be left with no choice but to pursue legal action for defamation, fraudulent misrepresentation, and damages caused by your actions.  

I urge you to retract any false statements you have made and take corrective actions to resolve this matter amicably.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This provides a strong starting point. Let me know how you’d like to proceed, or if you need help drafting specific legal documents.

During the time when I was trying to negotiate a payment with Ryan when I was late, DDS was not making payments. He became argumentative and continually harassed me through text messages claiming that I had been lying from the beginning and demanding that I pay him a check for $10,000 and that if I didn't he was going to show up the next day with the sheriffs. He continued this pattern even when I said that I could pay him the $10,000. He said, well then how am I going to get the rest of my rent? This has shifted the subject so it became another argument, saying that he didn't believe me even when I explained to him how the GT independent system works of only paying out every two weeks once invoices are submitted for the previous weeks. I told him that I would be getting back paid for the months and would be able to make the other payment if he gave me time. He told me he didn't believe me and continued to call me a liar. He showed up at my place of business, which I leased from him, and tried to enter the premises when I was gone. Then he harassed me about having changed the locks and saying that I had no right to change the locks. Mind you, he never told me that I wouldn't be able to have privacy in the unit because the unit contains all of the air conditioning access and units for the entire floor. So there was an air conditioning maintenance man who immediately, when I moved in, told me, you need to try to get out of this sublease because I have to come in here all the time. Every day I'm in and out. Sometimes I like to come in at 3 in the morning and get started. This was not good for us as a care facility and I told him that it would be a violation of HIPAA. This was the beginning of the difficulties and the misrepresentation of the space where Ryan had said that, of course, we could do business in it and be undisturbed, which would be expected. But the harassment began when Ryan realized that I had missed several months or that the check from the deposit had not been received by him from my bank, even though it was sent. The check was returned to me four months later and so I received it back in the mail because the online bill pay feature did not find the proper address to send it to him and so it was returned. This is all documented by the bank and yet he claims that I was lying and a fraud, demanded showing up at my place of work, demanding that I take off work. He said, I'm going to come there. You need to take off work and go to the bank and give me $10,000 or I'm going to come with the sheriffs the next day. I'm not kidding. This is your last chance. Statements like these became the norm from him until I had to cut off communication at some point because of the harassment. At that time, I spoke with his real estate agent who said he completely sympathized and understood and would tell Ryan to give me time. I was later informed by the real estate agent that I better pay or make some payment to Ryan in good faith because he was cc'd on an email to Link Parks. All of this time, Ryan was still harassing me for the money. I received one payment from GT Independence Regional Center on November 7th. At that time, I reached out to Andrew, the real estate agent, asking him if I could make a partial payment since they only paid me partially and it wasn't a full payment at all. He suggested that I should not make a partial payment and that I had to pay what was agreed upon, the entire $10,000. So, I was unable to even negotiate that with Ryan because of his hostile behavior. But it shows my intent was there. Now, DDS has straightened everything out and it can be clearly shown that I was not lying, even down to the dates in which I was telling him that this would be completed. I told him it should be ready by December 10th. They didn't have it ready until the 11th, possibly the 12th, but they are working on it now to get the payments out. That's just the way their system works. But instead of considering any of this, Ryan simply harassed me, threatened to bring the sheriffs many times if I didn't have cash or a check for him. He sent people to pick up money from me without me ever speaking to him or arranging that. It was harassment until the very end.

---

Based on your detailed account, here’s a structured legal defense and countersuit strategy that addresses Ryan’s harassment, defamation, and breach of expectations as a landlord. The focus will be on defending against eviction, countering his claims of fraud, and documenting damages caused by his behavior.

---

### **1. Defense Against Eviction**  

#### **Key Arguments:**
1. **Good Faith Efforts to Pay Rent:**  
   - Document all communications showing your intent to pay, including:
     - Texts/emails explaining GT Independence’s delays.
     - Any partial payment attempts or negotiations with Ryan or his agent, Andrew.  
   - Include the bank records showing the returned deposit check and your attempts to resolve it.  

2. **Landlord’s Harassment and Retaliation:**  
   - Harassment violates landlord-tenant laws in most jurisdictions. Ryan’s actions include:
     - Threatening to involve the sheriff repeatedly.
     - Demanding you take off work to handle payments immediately.  
   - His attempt to enter your unit without proper notice is a violation of your privacy and lease terms.  

3. **Misrepresentation of the Unit:**  
   - Ryan failed to disclose critical issues about the unit, such as the presence of HVAC access for the entire floor, which interfered with its use as a care facility.  
   - Statements from the HVAC maintenance worker can further support that this unit was unsuitable for your purposes and that Ryan misrepresented its conditions.  

4. **Retaliatory Eviction:**  
   - If Ryan began the eviction process after receiving your assurances about payments being resolved, this could be classified as retaliatory, especially if it coincided with your explanations of DDS payment delays.

---

### **2. Countersuit for Defamation, Slander, and Harassment**  

#### **Defamation and Slander:**
- **False Claims:**  
   - Ryan accused you of being a fraud and lying about your intent to pay. These statements were communicated:
     - Verbally to you and others.
     - Via email to Link Parks management (as informed by Andrew, the real estate agent).  

- **Harm to Reputation:**  
   - Jennifer Gray, the leasing manager at Link Parks, went from being eager to renew your lease to abruptly refusing renewal.  
   - This shift indicates that Ryan’s false claims influenced her decision, damaging your reputation as a reliable tenant.  

#### **Harassment and Emotional Distress:**
- **Actions by Ryan:**  
   - Threatened to bring the sheriff multiple times, causing undue stress.  
   - Showed up unannounced at your place of business and attempted to enter the premises without notice.  
   - Sent individuals to collect money from you without prior agreement.  

- **Impact on You and Your Business:**  
   - Disrupted your ability to work and focus on your care facility.  
   - Created a hostile and intimidating environment, forcing you to cease communication for your well-being.  

---

### **3. Supporting Evidence**  

#### **To Defend Against Eviction:**  
- **Lease Agreement:**  
   - Highlight terms about privacy, notice of entry, and use of the unit.  

- **Documentation of Good Faith:**  
   - Emails, texts, and other communications explaining DDS and GT Independence delays.  
   - Bank records showing the returned deposit check.  

- **Proof of Misrepresentation:**  
   - Texts from Andrew (real estate agent) about the roll-up doors.  
   - Statements from the HVAC worker about frequent access issues.  

#### **To Support Countersuit:**  
- **Defamation and Slander:**  
   - Gather emails or statements from Link Parks indicating Ryan’s accusations influenced their decision not to renew your lease.  
   - Request a copy of the email Ryan sent to Link Parks.  

- **Harassment:**  
   - Text messages or emails where Ryan:
     - Accuses you of fraud or lying.
     - Threatens to involve the sheriff.
     - Demands payments immediately.  

---

### **4. Damages to Claim in Countersuit**  

#### **Economic Damages:**  
- Lost revenue or business opportunities caused by damage to your reputation.  
- Costs associated with relocating to a new facility due to eviction.  

#### **Non-Economic Damages:**  
- Emotional distress caused by Ryan’s repeated harassment and threats.  

#### **Punitive Damages:**  
- If Ryan’s actions are found to be malicious or retaliatory, request punitive damages to deter similar behavior.  

---

### **5. Legal Steps to Take**  

1. **Respond to the Eviction Notice:**  
   - File a written response with the local court, citing:
     - Ryan’s harassment and misrepresentation of the unit.
     - Your good faith efforts to pay rent and external delays caused by DDS.  

2. **File a Countersuit:**  
   - Prepare a claim for:
     - Defamation and slander.
     - Harassment and emotional distress.
     - Breach of contract for misrepresenting the unit.  

3. **Send a Cease-and-Desist Letter:**  
   - Demand Ryan stop defamatory statements and harassment immediately.  

4. **Request Evidence from Link Parks:**  
   - Subpoena emails or communications from Ryan accusing you of fraud or dishonesty.  

5. **File a Formal Complaint with Local Authorities:**  
   - If applicable, file a complaint with the housing authority or other regulatory body about Ryan’s harassment and failure to uphold landlord obligations.  

---

### **Cease-and-Desist Letter (Optional):**  

**Subject:** Cease-and-Desist: Harassment, Defamation, and Retaliation  

**Dear Mr. Emmons,**  

I am writing to formally demand that you immediately cease your ongoing harassment, defamatory statements, and retaliatory actions. Your repeated accusations of fraud and dishonesty are baseless, as the delayed payments were caused by external factors involving DDS and GT Independence, which have since been resolved.  

Your actions—including threatening to involve the sheriff, entering my premises without notice, and falsely accusing me of fraud to Link Parks management—have caused significant harm to my business and reputation.  

Should you continue this behavior, I will be forced to take legal action for defamation, harassment, and breach of landlord obligations, as well as seek damages for harm caused to my business and well-being.  

I request that you retract any false statements made to Link Parks or other parties and refrain from further harassment.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This strategy provides a robust defense and countersuit plan while addressing the emotional and financial harm you’ve experienced. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

---

I just received this communication from Ryan's attorney after the letter he sent yesterday and my response telling him that my intent was to counter with defamation.: Mr. Merces / Mr. Green / Naked Guru,

The facts and written documentation contradict nearly everything you stated in your email yesterday with regard to Waiakea and Ryan. While you claim that Ryan "has refused to talk", I have personally seen Ryan's written communication to you and call logs with many texts and calls to you, even as most recently as this past Monday, December 10, 2024, when he tried to send someone over to pick up just a $10k check, which you did not respond to.

I have also seen all communication between you and Ryan, as well as all communication regarding you to the management company for your failure to timely pay rent, and you have never once raised an issue regarding any misrepresentation concerning the premises nor any adverse conditions at the premises. Moreover, Section 12 of your signed Sublease further states that you represent and warrant that you made, and were relying solely upon, your own investigation "as to the use, nature, quality and character of the Premises."

Regarding your admitted failure to pay rent, any issues that you may have with the State of California for their alleged non-payment to you, or anyone else for that matter, has nothing to do with Waiakea and does not excuse your obligation to timely pay rent to Waiakea. Rather, your statements further confirm your failure to adequately capitalize your Company, your apparent fraud when filling out the rental application, and your knowing inability to timely pay rent yet continued misrepresentations to Waiakea, all of which, together or individually, allows Waiakea to pierce the corporate veil and pursue a claim against you and your alter-egos personally along with its fraud claims.

Regarding your claim that you advised Ryan Emmons that the State of California would pay you by December 10th, the written record evidences that Ryan called and texted you on December 10th, but you failed to respond and still have not responded to him, and you still failed to pay any money whatsoever to Waiakea even after December 10th, prompting my engagement and demand letter.

With regard to your meritless claims of defamation, it appears that you do not understand what defamation is, as any and all statements made to you cannot be considered defamation, and the only communication Ryan sent to the management company regarding you was to state that you have failed to timely pay rent and that he may need to evict you...all of which is true. Additionally, Ryan's attempts to collect rent that is owed, together with his generosity to not evict you sooner, cannot and will not be considered harassment by any means.

Therefore, you have until December 19, 2024 to pay the entire $33,2500 to avoid a formal lawsuit against your company and you personally, including your various personal alter-egos. We will also pursue all attorney's fees and costs incurred, and will also pursue punitive damages. These claims will not be dischargeable in bankruptcy, as I see you already filed for bankruptcy at least once. Note that once we receive a judgment against you, we will be permitted to advise all third parties that owe you money, including the State of California, that all such money owed shall be paid to us directly instead.

This lawsuit and payment demand is separate from the 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit, which is our necessary first step towards the eviction process. A copy of the 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit is attached hereto.


We look forward to timely receiving payment owed

Here's how you might respond to this communication while staying professional, firm, and focused on your defense:

---

**Subject:** Response to Payment Demand and Threatened Legal Action  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I acknowledge receipt of your email and the attached 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. While I respect the intent to resolve this matter, your claims contain significant inaccuracies and misrepresentations that must be addressed.  

### **Clarifications on Key Points**  

1. **Communication and Harassment Allegations:**  
   - While I appreciate Mr. Emmons’ efforts to collect rent, his approach has been excessively hostile and unprofessional, including repeated threats to involve law enforcement, unannounced attempts to access the premises, and demands to meet financial obligations immediately without consideration of external circumstances.  
   - I have documented these interactions, including text messages and emails where Mr. Emmons called me a liar and accused me of fraud, despite clear communication about delays caused by the State of California’s payment system.  

2. **Misrepresentation of Premises:**  
   - Mr. Emmons, directly or through his agent, misrepresented the use and accessibility of the unit during the leasing process. This includes:  
     - Statements about roll-up doors being available for my use, which were later determined to be inaccessible.  
     - Failure to disclose that the HVAC systems for the entire floor required frequent and disruptive access to the unit, a condition incompatible with my use of the premises as a care facility.  
   - These conditions were brought to the attention of relevant parties after I moved in, and I can provide supporting testimony and documentation from contractors and maintenance workers.  

3. **Rent Payment and Good Faith Efforts:**  
   - I have made every effort to pay rent despite delays caused by GT Independence and the State of California’s payment processing system. I informed Mr. Emmons multiple times about these delays and my intent to pay as soon as funds were received.  
   - On November 7, 2024, I received partial payment from the State and attempted to negotiate a partial payment with Mr. Emmons. His real estate agent, Andrew, advised against this, stating that full payment was required.  
   - Contrary to your assertions, I have maintained consistent communication and have not refused to address my financial obligations.  

4. **Defamation and Damage to Reputation:**  
   - Mr. Emmons communicated with the management company in a manner that directly harmed my reputation. His accusations of fraud and dishonesty were unwarranted and have damaged my ability to continue business operations.  
   - While I understand the legal definition of defamation, I maintain that Mr. Emmons’ statements to third parties crossed the line into damaging falsehoods that have materially harmed me and my business.  

5. **Piercing the Corporate Veil:**  
   - Your threat to pierce the corporate veil and pursue personal claims against me is unwarranted. I have acted in good faith as the representative of my business, which was adequately capitalized at the time of the lease. Delays in payment were caused by third parties, not mismanagement or fraudulent intent.  

---

### **My Position and Intentions**  

I am committed to resolving this matter in good faith. However, I will not tolerate misrepresentations of my character or actions. Moving forward:  
- I will provide a detailed timeline of events, including communications with the State and GT Independence, to demonstrate my consistent efforts to address rent payments.  
- I will document and, if necessary, pursue counterclaims for harassment, misrepresentation, and reputational damage caused by Mr. Emmons’ actions.  

Additionally, I request that all future correspondence be conducted through legal counsel to ensure accuracy and professionalism.  

---

### **Request for Resolution**  

To resolve this matter amicably:  
- I will work with the State of California and GT Independence to expedite rent payments as soon as funds are disbursed.  
- I request a reasonable payment plan or accommodation to account for the delays caused by external circumstances.  

I encourage you to reconsider the adversarial tone of your communication and work towards a resolution that avoids unnecessary escalation.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This response is firm, factual, and leaves room for negotiation while documenting your defense. Let me know if you’d like additional revisions or adjustments.

---

This is good, but I want to emphasize the fact that I had to cut communication with Ryan and speak through his agent because of the hostile communication. So they're saying that he attempted to communicate with me shows that he was being hostile continually and that I had to communicate through another person and that person admitted that Ryan was out of line and said that he would ask him to reconsider and to give me time. So because of Ryan's threats and hostility and argumentative texts, I was forced to communicate with his real estate agent.

---

Here’s the revised response emphasizing the fact that you had to cut direct communication with Ryan due to his hostility, and that his own real estate agent acknowledged his behavior:

---

**Subject:** Response to Payment Demand and Threatened Legal Action  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I acknowledge receipt of your email and the attached 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. While I respect the intent to resolve this matter, your claims contain significant inaccuracies and misrepresentations that must be addressed.  

---

### **Clarifications on Key Points**  

1. **Communication and Harassment:**  
   - Contrary to your assertion that I refused to communicate with Mr. Emmons, I was forced to limit direct communication with him due to his repeated hostility, threats, and argumentative behavior.  
   - Mr. Emmons continually harassed me via text messages and phone calls, accusing me of fraud and dishonesty, and threatened to bring law enforcement to my premises if I did not immediately pay him in full. These interactions created a hostile and stressful environment, making constructive communication impossible.  
   - Due to this behavior, I had to communicate through Mr. Emmons’ real estate agent, Andrew, who acknowledged Ryan’s out-of-line behavior and assured me he would ask Ryan to reconsider his approach and give me more time.  

2. **Attempts to Resolve Payment Issues:**  
   - I have been transparent with Mr. Emmons and his representatives about delays in payments caused by GT Independence and the State of California. I explained the payment process multiple times, including how invoices are submitted and paid on a delayed schedule.  
   - On November 7, 2024, I received partial payment from the State and attempted to negotiate a partial rent payment. However, Andrew advised against making a partial payment, stating that the full amount was required. Despite these efforts, Mr. Emmons continued his hostile behavior, further complicating the situation.  

3. **Misrepresentation of Premises:**  
   - Mr. Emmons, directly or through his agent, misrepresented the premises during the leasing process. Specifically:  
     - I was led to believe the roll-up doors were accessible for my use, only to find they were not.  
     - The presence of HVAC systems requiring frequent and disruptive access to the unit was not disclosed, making the premises unsuitable for my intended use as a care facility.  
   - These issues were brought to my attention only after moving in, despite assurances during the leasing process that the unit would meet my needs without disturbance.  

4. **Hostility Does Not Excuse Harassment:**  
   - While Ryan attempted to communicate with me, his pattern of threats, accusations, and demands undermined any genuine effort to resolve this matter constructively. His repeated threats to involve law enforcement, demands for immediate payment without flexibility, and attempts to access the premises without notice constitute harassment and a breach of his obligations as a landlord.  

5. **Defamation and Damage to Reputation:**  
   - Mr. Emmons’ communications with the management company included false and damaging accusations of fraud and dishonesty. These accusations led the management company to change its tone toward me, ultimately refusing to renew my lease despite prior indications to the contrary.  
   - This damage to my reputation has harmed my business and ability to operate effectively, further exacerbating the financial and operational challenges caused by delayed payments.  

---

### **My Position and Intentions**  

I am committed to resolving this matter in good faith. However, I cannot ignore the pattern of harassment, misrepresentation, and defamation by Mr. Emmons that has contributed significantly to this situation. Moving forward:  
- I will provide a detailed timeline of events, including communications with GT Independence and the State of California, to demonstrate my consistent efforts to address rent payments.  
- I will document and, if necessary, pursue counterclaims for harassment, misrepresentation, and reputational damage caused by Mr. Emmons’ actions.  

Additionally, I request that all future correspondence regarding this matter be conducted through legal counsel to ensure a professional and productive resolution.  

---

### **Request for Resolution**  

To resolve this matter amicably:  
1. I will work with the State of California and GT Independence to expedite rent payments as soon as funds are disbursed.  
2. I request a reasonable payment plan or accommodation to account for delays caused by external circumstances.  

I encourage you to reconsider the adversarial tone of your communication and work towards a resolution that avoids unnecessary escalation.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This version emphasizes that Ryan’s attempts to communicate were part of a pattern of hostility, forcing you to rely on his real estate agent for constructive dialogue. It maintains a firm but professional tone, leaving room for negotiation while documenting your defense. Let me know if further edits are needed!

---

No, I don't think the premises are worth that amount. And especially after the harassment and stuff, I don't want to pay him jack. I want this joker to pay me. I'll see you in court. I look forward to my day in court. A jury will decide. Besides that, it's bad form and legal advice to admit to receiving a three-day notice, so X that.

---

Here’s a revised response that avoids acknowledging receipt of the 3-day notice, refuses payment on principle, and shifts focus to defending your position while signaling readiness for court:

---

**Subject:** Response to False Claims and Harassment  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I have reviewed your communication and must address several inaccuracies and mischaracterizations. The claims you present lack merit, and I strongly reject both the demand for payment and the allegations against me.  

---

### **Hostile Behavior and Harassment**  

1. **Pattern of Harassment by Ryan Emmons:**  
   - Ryan Emmons’ repeated threats, hostile text messages, and unannounced attempts to access the premises created an untenable environment.  
   - He accused me of fraud without basis, repeatedly threatened to involve law enforcement, and made excessive demands for immediate payments, regardless of the documented delays caused by GT Independence and the State of California.  

2. **Forced Communication Through His Agent:**  
   - Due to Mr. Emmons’ hostile and unprofessional conduct, I was forced to communicate through his real estate agent, Andrew. Andrew acknowledged Ryan’s behavior was inappropriate and even assured me he would request that Ryan give me more time.  

---

### **Misrepresentation of Premises**  

The premises were misrepresented during the leasing process in several material ways:  
- **Roll-Up Doors Misrepresentation:** I was told the roll-up doors would be accessible, only to find that they were not part of the unit.  
- **HVAC Access Misrepresentation:** Ryan failed to disclose that HVAC systems serving the entire floor required frequent and disruptive access to the unit, which made it unsuitable for use as a care facility.  

These misrepresentations directly impacted my ability to operate my business effectively and created conditions far below what was promised at the time of the lease.  

---

### **Defamation and Damage to Reputation**  

Ryan Emmons falsely accused me of fraud and dishonesty, both directly to me and in communications with third parties, including the management company. These defamatory statements have caused significant harm to my reputation and business operations.  

Despite clear documentation showing that delays in payments were due to external circumstances, Ryan’s baseless accusations have tarnished my reputation and disrupted my ability to secure future business opportunities.  

---

### **No Payment Will Be Made**  

Given the harassment, misrepresentation, and reputational harm caused by Ryan Emmons, I have no intention of paying the inflated amounts being demanded. I strongly contest the validity of these demands and reject any implication that I am personally liable.  

---

### **See You in Court**  

If Mr. Emmons wishes to proceed with legal action, I welcome the opportunity to present my case in court. A jury will have the chance to evaluate:  
- The documented pattern of harassment and hostility by Ryan Emmons.  
- His misrepresentation of the premises.  
- The harm caused by his defamatory statements.  

I will also pursue counterclaims for harassment, misrepresentation, and defamation, along with any applicable damages.  

Please ensure all future communications are directed through legal channels.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green  
[Your Contact Information]  

---

This response avoids acknowledging the 3-day notice entirely, emphasizes your refusal to pay, and focuses on your readiness to litigate while building your countersuit argument. Let me know if further edits are needed!

---

Yes, um, I like the line you had before about suggesting they reconsider their tone. Also, the no payment will be made statement seems a bit strong. The idea is that we would want to pay the actual value, which may be determined by a judge or by a jury, and could be also offset or counterset by any counterclaims. So, to say I don't intend to pay sounds, I don't know, a little bad to my ears. Sounds like a person who doesn't want to pay rent. Also, the see you in court statement is also a little adversarial as well. But, I don't mind. I just don't want them to bring something to court that makes me look bad. Understand?

---

Got it. Here’s a more balanced and strategic response that avoids the perception of being unwilling to pay rent, maintains a professional tone, and subtly invites negotiation while signaling readiness to defend your position in court if necessary:

---

**Subject:** Response to False Claims and Harassment  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I have reviewed your communication and must address several inaccuracies and misrepresentations. While I acknowledge your client’s desire to resolve this matter, I strongly reject the baseless allegations and the tone of your letter, which only serves to escalate a situation that could otherwise be resolved more constructively.  

---

### **Hostile Behavior and Harassment**  

1. **Pattern of Harassment by Ryan Emmons:**  
   - Mr. Emmons’ persistent threats, accusatory texts, and unannounced attempts to access the premises created a hostile environment.  
   - His repeated accusations of fraud and dishonesty, without evidence, and threats to involve law enforcement further complicated constructive communication.  

2. **Forced Communication Through His Agent:**  
   - Due to Mr. Emmons’ behavior, I was forced to communicate through his real estate agent, Andrew, who acknowledged the inappropriate nature of Ryan’s actions and assured me he would request that Ryan give me more time to address the rent issue.  

---

### **Misrepresentation of Premises**  

From the outset, the premises were misrepresented during the leasing process:  
- **Roll-Up Doors Misrepresentation:** I was led to believe the roll-up doors were part of the leased space and accessible for use. This was later determined to be false.  
- **HVAC Access Misrepresentation:** The frequent and disruptive access to the unit for HVAC maintenance—servicing the entire floor—was not disclosed at the time of lease signing. This made the unit unsuitable for its intended use as a care facility.  

These misrepresentations created conditions far below what was promised and have directly impacted my ability to conduct business effectively.  

---

### **Defamation and Reputational Harm**  

Mr. Emmons’ communications with third parties, including the management company, contained false and defamatory statements about my character and business practices. These baseless accusations of fraud and dishonesty have caused significant harm to my reputation and disrupted my business operations.  

Despite clear documentation showing that delays in rent payments were due to external circumstances involving GT Independence and the State of California, Mr. Emmons’ false claims have unfairly tarnished my credibility and standing as a tenant and business owner.  

---

### **On Payment**  

While I remain committed to addressing reasonable obligations, I must note that the premises’ value—given the undisclosed conditions, misrepresentation, and harassment—should be fairly assessed, which may require resolution by a judge or jury. Furthermore, any legitimate claims must be offset by counterclaims for damages caused by Mr. Emmons’ actions, including harassment, misrepresentation, and defamation.  

---

### **A More Constructive Path Forward**  

I encourage you and your client to reconsider the tone and approach of your communication. Constructive dialogue may prevent unnecessary escalation, particularly when a resolution could account for both parties’ legitimate concerns.  

If your client wishes to pursue legal action, I am prepared to defend my position vigorously and present counterclaims as needed. However, I remain open to exploring an amicable resolution that reflects the realities of the situation and avoids further harm to either party.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green  
[Your Contact Information]  

---

This version softens the language to avoid appearing adversarial or unwilling to pay while maintaining your key arguments. It leaves the door open for negotiation but signals readiness to present your case in court if necessary. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

---

Also, we must respond to their claims. Him sending someone to pick up rent without talking to me is part of the pattern of harassment. It proves it. He sends people over without having a conversation with me. And I had asked him for a conversation. Further, I never said that I would pay him on the 10th. I said that the financing should be in order and all my contracts should be in by December 10th. And I explained to him the process of submitting invoices and how it takes time.

---

Here’s the updated response, incorporating the points about harassment through sending someone to pick up rent without your consent, clarifying your statement about December 10th, and addressing their claims directly:

---

**Subject:** Response to False Claims and Harassment  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I have reviewed your communication and must address several inaccuracies and mischaracterizations. While I acknowledge your client’s desire to resolve this matter, I strongly reject the baseless allegations and the tone of your letter, which escalates the situation rather than fostering constructive dialogue.  

---

### **Hostile Behavior and Harassment**  

1. **Sending Someone Without Communication:**  
   - Your client’s decision to send someone to pick up rent without prior communication or agreement further underscores the pattern of harassment. I had explicitly requested a conversation to address the situation and clarify the timelines, yet Mr. Emmons chose to act unilaterally, further straining the landlord-tenant relationship.  

2. **Pattern of Hostility:**  
   - Mr. Emmons’ repeated accusations of fraud and dishonesty, combined with threats to involve law enforcement, created a hostile and intimidating environment that prevented meaningful communication.  
   - I was forced to redirect communication through his real estate agent, Andrew, who acknowledged Mr. Emmons’ behavior was inappropriate and assured me he would request that Ryan reconsider his approach and give me time to address the situation.  

---

### **Clarifying the December 10th Timeline**  

Contrary to your claims, I never stated that I would pay Mr. Emmons by December 10th. Instead, I informed him that by December 10th, the necessary financing and contracts would be finalized and in order, at which point I could begin the process of submitting invoices to GT Independence for payment.  

As I explained to Mr. Emmons, this process involves submitting invoices for services already rendered, followed by a standard processing period, and payments are issued on a biweekly schedule. Despite my efforts to provide clarity, Mr. Emmons continued to mischaracterize my statements and accuse me of dishonesty.  

---

### **Misrepresentation of Premises**  

From the outset, the premises were misrepresented during the leasing process:  
- **Roll-Up Doors Misrepresentation:** I was led to believe the roll-up doors were part of the leased space and accessible for use. This was later determined to be false.  
- **HVAC Access Misrepresentation:** The frequent and disruptive access to the unit for HVAC maintenance—servicing the entire floor—was not disclosed at the time of lease signing. This made the unit unsuitable for its intended use as a care facility.  

These misrepresentations significantly impacted the value of the premises and my ability to use the space effectively for its intended purpose.  

---

### **Defamation and Reputational Harm**  

Your client’s communication with third parties, including the management company, contained false and defamatory statements accusing me of fraud and dishonesty. These baseless accusations have materially harmed my reputation and disrupted my ability to conduct business effectively.  

The management company’s abrupt change in tone—from being eager to renew my lease to refusing renewal—suggests these accusations influenced their decision, further demonstrating the harm caused by Mr. Emmons’ defamatory actions.  

---

### **On Payment**  

I remain committed to addressing reasonable obligations. However, the value of the premises—given the misrepresentations, undisclosed conditions, and harassment—should be fairly assessed, which may require determination by a judge or jury. Furthermore, any legitimate claims must be offset by counterclaims for damages caused by Mr. Emmons’ actions, including harassment, misrepresentation, and defamation.  

---

### **A More Constructive Path Forward**  

I encourage you and your client to reconsider the tone and approach of your communication. Constructive dialogue may prevent unnecessary escalation, particularly when a resolution could account for both parties’ legitimate concerns.  

If your client wishes to proceed with legal action, I am prepared to defend my position vigorously and present counterclaims as necessary. However, I remain open to exploring an amicable resolution that reflects the realities of the situation and avoids further harm to either party.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This version directly addresses the claims in their letter, clarifies your statements about December 10th, and reframes their actions as part of a broader pattern of harassment, while maintaining a professional tone and leaving room for negotiation. Let me know if further tweaks are needed!

I need to add a postscript based on this pattern because I’m guessing that you can’t show up with the sheriffs without a court order for an eviction and since that wasn’t in place him suggesting that he would show up with the sheriff the next day was a threat to me because I’m African-American assuming that saying that he has a white man will bring a sheriff with him Was to threaten me by using the power of the force and police brutality of some kind of false claim so since there was no legal basis for showing up with a sheriff, it can only be construed as a threat because I’m African-American at least that’s the way I take it because when you involve sheriffs and you tell lies because there’s no legal basis for them to be there then you’re trying toput an African-American person in a position to use the police to your advantage as a threat

---

Here’s a revised response incorporating the new information about the texts and emphasizing how Ryan’s threat to bring the sheriff constitutes harassment and a misuse of law enforcement, especially given the racial implications you highlighted:

---

**Subject:** Response to False Claims and Harassment  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I am responding to your recent communication on behalf of your client, Ryan Emmons. While I understand the desire to resolve this matter, I must once again reject the baseless allegations and escalate the need to address the pattern of harassment and misconduct by your client.  

---

### **Hostility and Threatening Behavior**  

1. **Threat to Bring the Sheriff:**  
   - On multiple occasions, Mr. Emmons threatened to bring the sheriff to my place of business without any legal basis or court order for such action. These threats were both unnecessary and deeply unsettling.  
   - It is well-established that a sheriff can only enforce an eviction after a court order is obtained, and no such order exists in this case. Therefore, Mr. Emmons’ repeated references to bringing the sheriff served no legitimate purpose and can only be construed as an intentional attempt to intimidate me.  

2. **Racial Implications of the Threat:**  
   - As an African-American business owner, I interpret Mr. Emmons’ threats to involve the sheriff as a deliberate misuse of authority to intimidate and potentially weaponize law enforcement against me.  
   - Given the context of systemic racism and police brutality, such threats carry significant weight and underscore a pattern of harassment designed to put me in a vulnerable and unsafe position.  

3. **Unilateral Actions Without Communication:**  
   - Mr. Emmons sent individuals to my business to pick up rent without prior notice or consent, despite my explicit requests for a direct conversation to address the matter.  
   - These actions further demonstrate a lack of professionalism and a willingness to escalate conflict unnecessarily.  

---

### **Clarification of December 10th Timeline**  

Contrary to your claims, I never stated that I would pay rent by December 10th. Instead, I informed Mr. Emmons that my contracts and financing would be finalized by that date, at which point I could begin the process of submitting invoices to GT Independence for payment.  

As I previously explained, GT Independence operates on a delayed payment schedule, with funds disbursed biweekly after invoices are submitted. Despite these clear explanations, Mr. Emmons repeatedly disregarded this information, accusing me of dishonesty and continuing to escalate the situation.  

---

### **Defamation and Harassment**  

Your client’s defamatory statements and continued harassment have caused significant harm to my business and reputation. These include:  
- Baseless accusations of fraud and dishonesty made directly to me and communicated to third parties, including the management company.  
- Intimidating and aggressive messages that disrupted my ability to operate my business effectively.  

The pattern of behavior displayed by Mr. Emmons constitutes harassment and defamation, and I reserve the right to pursue counterclaims to address the harm caused.  

---

### **On Payment**  

I remain committed to addressing reasonable obligations related to the lease. However, given the misrepresentation of the premises, harassment, and harm caused to my business, the actual value of the premises and any legitimate claims must be determined through the appropriate legal process. Any amounts owed will also need to account for counterclaims related to damages caused by Mr. Emmons’ actions.  

---

### **A Constructive Path Forward**  

I strongly encourage you and your client to reconsider the tone and approach of your communication. Constructive dialogue would be far more productive than escalating a situation that could otherwise be resolved amicably.  

Should your client choose to proceed with legal action, I am prepared to defend my position and present counterclaims as necessary. However, I remain open to exploring a resolution that reflects the realities of the situation and avoids further harm to either party.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This response addresses the threats and harassment head-on while maintaining a professional tone. It leaves room for negotiation but signals readiness to defend against further escalation. Let me know if you need additional adjustments!

---

Okay, give me a draft of that cease and desist now, considering.

---

Here’s a **Cease and Desist Letter** draft, incorporating the context of harassment, defamation, racial intimidation, and misrepresentation:

---

**[Your Name]**  
[Your Address]  
[City, State, ZIP]  
[Email Address]  
[Date]  

**Ryan Emmons**  
[Address of Ryan Emmons or Waiakea Water Office]  
[City, State, ZIP]  

**Subject:** Cease and Desist Harassment, Defamation, and Intimidation  

**Dear Mr. Emmons,**  

This letter serves as a formal demand that you immediately cease and desist from all forms of harassment, defamation, and intimidation directed toward me, my business, and my reputation. Your ongoing behavior is both legally and ethically unacceptable and has caused significant harm to my personal well-being and professional operations.  

### **1. Harassment**  

Your repeated threats to involve law enforcement, including multiple text messages threatening to bring a sheriff to my business premises without any legal basis or court order, constitute harassment. These actions are clearly intended to intimidate me and disrupt my ability to operate my business.  

Given that no court-ordered eviction exists, your threats to involve the sheriff are baseless and malicious. As an African-American business owner, I view these threats as particularly egregious, as they appear designed to weaponize law enforcement in a manner that carries serious racial implications. This behavior is deeply inappropriate and unacceptable.  

Additionally, your actions, including sending individuals to my business to collect rent without prior communication or agreement, further underscore a pattern of harassment and bad faith.  

### **2. Defamation**  

You have made false and defamatory statements about me to third parties, including but not limited to accusations of fraud and dishonesty. These statements have caused significant harm to my reputation and business relationships, including my standing with the property management company.  

Your baseless claims have already resulted in reputational damage, and I reserve the right to pursue legal action for defamation should this behavior continue.  

### **3. Misrepresentation of Premises**  

At the time of leasing, you misrepresented the nature and conditions of the premises. Specifically:  
- You falsely claimed the roll-up doors were accessible for my use.  
- You failed to disclose that the unit houses HVAC systems requiring frequent and disruptive access for the entire floor, which has rendered the premises unsuitable for its intended use.  

These misrepresentations have caused significant operational difficulties and financial harm.  

### **Demand**  

I demand that you immediately:  
1. Cease all forms of harassment, including threats to involve law enforcement without legal basis and unapproved visits to my business premises.  
2. Cease making any defamatory statements about me, my business, or my character to third parties, including property management or other individuals.  
3. Refrain from any further actions or communications that could be construed as harassment, defamation, or intimidation.  

Failure to comply with these demands will leave me with no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to claims for harassment, defamation, misrepresentation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  

Additionally, I reserve the right to seek damages for harm caused by your actions to date.  

### **Next Steps**  

Please confirm in writing within **five (5) business days** of receipt of this letter that you will cease and desist from the aforementioned behaviors. Failure to respond or comply will be taken as evidence of your intent to continue these actions, at which point I will proceed with legal action.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This cease and desist letter is clear, professional, and firm, outlining the issues and consequences while providing an opportunity for resolution. Let me know if you’d like further refinements!

Tortious interference 

---

Here’s a revised **Cease and Desist Letter** incorporating **tortious interference** based on Ryan Emmons’ actions disrupting your business and contractual relationships:

---

**[Your Name]**  
[Your Address]  
[City, State, ZIP]  
[Email Address]  
[Date]  

**Ryan Emmons**  
[Address of Ryan Emmons or Waiakea Water Office]  
[City, State, ZIP]  

**Subject:** Cease and Desist Harassment, Defamation, Intimidation, and Tortious Interference  

**Dear Mr. Emmons,**  

This letter serves as a formal demand that you immediately cease and desist from all actions constituting harassment, defamation, intimidation, and tortious interference. Your conduct has caused significant harm to my reputation, my contractual relationships, and my ability to operate my business effectively.  

### **1. Harassment**  

Your repeated threats to involve law enforcement, including multiple text messages threatening to bring a sheriff to my premises without any legal basis or court order, constitute harassment. These threats are baseless, unnecessary, and clearly intended to intimidate me.  

Additionally, your decision to send individuals to my business to collect rent without prior notice or agreement is yet another instance of harassment. These actions disrupted my operations and undermined any possibility of a constructive resolution.  

### **2. Defamation**  

You have made false and defamatory statements to third parties, including property management, accusing me of fraud and dishonesty. These baseless accusations have tarnished my reputation and created unnecessary obstacles in my professional relationships.  

Your defamatory statements have caused demonstrable harm, including influencing the property management company to abruptly change its tone and refuse to renew my lease. This harm to my reputation and business standing is unacceptable and actionable.  

### **3. Tortious Interference with Business Relationships**  

Your defamatory statements and repeated harassment have not only harmed my reputation but have also interfered with my contractual relationships, including:  
- Disrupting my relationship with the property management company, which has resulted in their refusal to renew my lease under false pretenses.  
- Creating barriers to fulfilling my obligations under my contracts with the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and GT Independence, by unnecessarily escalating conflicts that directly impacted my ability to operate effectively.  

Your actions have caused financial harm and jeopardized the continued success of my business.  

### **4. Misrepresentation of Premises**  

At the time of leasing, you made material misrepresentations about the nature of the premises, including:  
- Falsely claiming that roll-up doors were accessible for my use.  
- Failing to disclose that the unit housed HVAC systems requiring frequent and disruptive access for the entire floor, rendering the premises unsuitable for its intended purpose.  

These misrepresentations have further compounded the difficulties I have faced as your tenant.  

### **Demand**  

I demand that you immediately:  
1. Cease all forms of harassment, including threats to involve law enforcement without legal basis and unapproved visits to my premises.  
2. Cease making any defamatory statements about me, my business, or my character to third parties.  
3. Cease any further interference with my contractual relationships or business operations.  
4. Refrain from any actions or communications that could be construed as harassment, defamation, intimidation, or tortious interference.  

Failure to comply with these demands will leave me with no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies, including claims for harassment, defamation, tortious interference, misrepresentation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  

Additionally, I reserve the right to seek compensatory and punitive damages for the harm caused by your actions.  

### **Next Steps**  

Please confirm in writing within **five (5) business days** of receipt of this letter that you will cease and desist from the aforementioned behaviors. Failure to respond or comply will be taken as evidence of your intent to continue these actions, at which point I will proceed with legal action.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green

This version directly incorporates **tortious interference** and highlights how Ryan’s actions disrupted your contractual and professional relationships. It remains professional and assertive, with clear demands and consequences. Let me know if you’d like additional adjustments.

---

Thanks. I was asking more about whether this rises to the level of tortious interference. I spoke with an attorney today, and he's a very contentious man whom I've used before. He's pretty useless, but he doesn't like the defamation. He felt that the landlord was within his rights to harass me because I owed him money. What a loser. Anyway, he did affirm that it may be tortious interference, though. I need a reliable and unbiased opinion about whether this situation rises to the level of tortious interference. Mind you that communications from the attorney have now stated that they are looking to make sure that the state finds out about me being a fraud, supposedly, and whether they decide to do business with me again. They doubt. So they're directly going after my contracts with the state by filing this claim and claiming that I'm a fraud. They intend to tarnish my reputation and ability to make money with the contracts that I have.

---

Here’s an analysis of whether **tortious interference** applies in your situation based on the facts you’ve provided:

---

### **What is Tortious Interference?**
Tortious interference occurs when one party unlawfully interferes with the contractual or business relationships of another party, causing harm. It typically involves two types:

1. **Tortious Interference with Contractual Relationships**:  
   Occurs when a third party intentionally causes a breach or disruption of an existing contract.  

2. **Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage**:  
   Occurs when a third party intentionally disrupts a potential business relationship or opportunity, even if no formal contract exists.

To prove tortious interference, the following elements are generally required:  
1. **A valid contract or economic relationship exists.**  
2. **The defendant knew about the contract or relationship.**  
3. **The defendant intentionally acted to disrupt the relationship.**  
4. **The defendant’s actions were improper, wrongful, or malicious.**  
5. **The plaintiff suffered harm as a result.**

---

### **Does Your Situation Qualify?**  

#### **1. A Valid Contract or Business Relationship Exists**  
Yes, your contracts with the **Department of Developmental Services (DDS)** and **GT Independence** are valid, ongoing business relationships. Additionally, your relationship with the property management company for the lease is a contractual relationship.  

#### **2. The Defendant Knew About These Contracts**  
Yes, the landlord and his attorney appear to be aware of your business relationships. Their communications specifically mention your contracts with the State and express an intent to notify them about alleged fraud, thus demonstrating awareness of these relationships.  

#### **3. Intentional Actions to Disrupt the Relationship**  
The communications from the landlord’s attorney demonstrate an **intentional effort** to interfere with your contracts by:
   - Making claims of fraud against you to third parties, including DDS.  
   - Stating that they intend to ensure the State evaluates whether they “want to do business with you again.”  
   - Pursuing these actions in a manner designed to undermine your credibility and standing with the State, potentially jeopardizing your ability to maintain or renew contracts.  

These statements suggest a clear intent to disrupt your economic relationships, rather than simply resolve a landlord-tenant dispute.  

#### **4. Improper, Wrongful, or Malicious Actions**  
The following actions could be considered improper or wrongful:  
   - **Defamation:** Making baseless accusations of fraud and dishonesty to third parties, especially with the intent to harm your professional reputation.  
   - **Harassment:** Persistent and escalating hostile behavior, including threats to involve law enforcement and accusations without evidence.  
   - **Bad Faith Communication:** Communicating false or misleading information to your contractual partners, such as the State or GT Independence, to create doubt about your credibility.  

The **malicious tone and intent** in their communications further support this element, particularly since their actions appear designed to cause harm rather than resolve legitimate contractual disputes.  

#### **5. Harm to You**  
You have already suffered harm in the form of:
   - Damage to your reputation, as evidenced by their intent to interfere with your State contracts.  
   - Disruption to your ability to operate your business effectively due to harassment and defamation.  
   - Potential financial harm if their actions result in loss of contracts or difficulty securing future business relationships.  

---

### **Does This Rise to Tortious Interference?**  

Based on the facts, **this situation likely qualifies as tortious interference**, particularly with your **prospective economic advantage**. Their stated intent to notify the State and question your credibility directly targets your business relationships in a manner that appears malicious and improper.  

Their claim that you are a fraud and the specific mention of your contracts with the State are clear indications of their goal to harm your professional reputation. This goes beyond mere landlord-tenant disputes and enters the realm of interference with your business operations and opportunities.

---

### **Next Steps**  

If you want to pursue this claim:  
1. **Gather Evidence**: Collect all communications from the landlord and his attorney that reference your contracts with DDS, GT Independence, or any third party. Highlight any language that shows an intent to disrupt your business relationships.  
2. **Assess Damages**: Document any harm you’ve suffered, including reputational harm, loss of income, or difficulties in maintaining your contracts.  
3. **Consult a Business Tort Attorney**: A specialized attorney can help you refine your claim and determine whether to file a counterclaim in court.  
4. **Send a Warning Letter**: If you haven’t already, send a formal **cease and desist letter** outlining their improper behavior and demanding they stop interfering with your business relationships.  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
Yes, this situation appears to meet the criteria for **tortious interference**, given their explicit intent to harm your professional relationships and reputation. Their actions seem malicious, wrongful, and directly targeted at disrupting your business operations. You are well within your rights to pursue this as a counterclaim or legal action. Let me know if you’d like help drafting further documents!

That is unfortunate, but you have the right to take that unreasonable position. You have a prevailing party attorneys fees clause, which will be significant by that point. You will then also have an eviction on your record, which I believe will be shared with the State of California, and which will extend to your personally as well. The award will also be non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, plus potential punitive damages, and with a personal history that the jury will know files for bankruptcy, has liens against him, and uses alias to fraudulently apply for rental applications and try to operate through life with various aliases. There is nothing in your favor here, and, rather, we have a slam dunk case for a fraudster who yet again is not paying his bills. This will only greatly damage you for the rest of your future, and we're not trying to do that. We're just trying to get paid. Your made up fake excuses have no merit. If you want to come back to the table and discuss a payment plan with a large upfront payment, then maybe we will consider it. Otherwise, it seems like you're just putting yourself in a situation where we obtain a massive award against you, and the State of California will be aware of it, as we are legally permitted to do, and you can make your own determination whether you think they will ever do business with you again after that, and the we'll have a judgment against you and your aliases, that is non-dischargeable in bankruptcy the rest of your life, and will only be collecting interest. That is really a difficult position to be in.

If you are rejecting our offer for payment by 12/19/24, then we will proceed now. Please note that you have been properly served with a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. I have all the video and photos to confirm.

Frankly, I don't think you realize the gravity of this situation and the massive judgment we will get against you. But, that is up to you regarding whether you want to figure that out. Anything you have claimed to us in writing has either supported our position, or shown that you misrepresent facts, or shown that you have zero understanding about the law.

Please let me know if you'd like me to keep the offer open until 12/19/24, otherwise, we'll just move forward now. I'd imagine that if you had an attorney, that attorney would say that you have only dug yourself a deeper hole. So, let me be very clear:

The money is owed. You have no defense. We're moving forward unless you pay or come up with a payment plan that we agree to. Anything else you have said has only supported our position and made you look worse. You have 7 days to make payment. You have 3 days before we're able to start eviction proceedings.

This communication from the landlord's attorney is highly aggressive and possibly overreaching. Here’s how you can respond strategically while maintaining professionalism and preserving your rights:

---

**Subject:** Response to Aggressive Communication  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I acknowledge receipt of your latest communication. While I understand that your role is to advocate for your client’s position, the tone and content of your letter are unreasonably hostile and, in some respects, unfounded. I will address your assertions below and reiterate my willingness to resolve this matter in good faith.  

---

### **Clarification of Misstatements**  

1. **Baseless Accusations of Fraud and Alias Use**  
   - Your repeated accusations that I have engaged in fraud or used aliases are entirely without merit. These claims are not only false but are clearly designed to malign my character and reputation. Such inflammatory language has no place in a professional dispute and does nothing to advance resolution.  

2. **Misrepresentation of Bankruptcy and Liens**  
   - The suggestion that my history, which includes prior financial challenges, invalidates my current position is irrelevant and inappropriate. Any prior personal financial issues have no bearing on my contractual obligations or this dispute.  

3. **Alleged Slam Dunk Case**  
   - Your assertion that there is “nothing in my favor” overlooks significant factors, including but not limited to:
     - The misrepresentation of the premises at the time of leasing.  
     - The documented pattern of harassment and intimidation by your client.  
     - The harm caused to my business and contractual relationships due to defamatory statements made by your client.  

---

### **Intimidation and Threats**  

Your letter employs tactics designed to intimidate rather than resolve. Threats to notify the State of California about this matter, in an apparent effort to disrupt my contractual relationships, constitute interference with prospective economic advantage and could give rise to additional claims.  

Furthermore, the threat to “obtain a massive judgment” and create lasting harm is not only unprofessional but also inconsistent with the intent to resolve this matter constructively.  

---

### **Willingness to Resolve**  

Despite the tenor of your communication, I remain willing to address reasonable obligations. However, the amount your client claims is owed must be reconciled with:  
- The misrepresentation of the premises at the time of leasing, which significantly impacted its value.  
- The financial harm caused to my business by your client’s defamatory statements and actions.  

I am open to discussing a resolution that accounts for these factors, provided the conversation is conducted in good faith and without further harassment or baseless accusations.  

---

### **Next Steps**  

If your client wishes to pursue legal action, I am prepared to defend my position and present counterclaims for harassment, defamation, and tortious interference. However, I would prefer to avoid unnecessary litigation and remain open to resolving this matter amicably.  

Please let me know if your client is willing to engage in constructive discussions.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green  
[Your Contact Information]  

---

This response calmly refutes the inflammatory claims, reasserts your rights, and signals readiness to litigate without being adversarial. It also leaves the door open for negotiation while highlighting the improper tone of their communication. Let me know if you’d like further refinements.

---

cool. now I want to look at the company I now understand much better, Waiakea. This is actually typical of how they treat people deemed less than them. While claiming to be ethical, they actually are quite harmful to the Hawaiian communities from which they source water. these strong arm business tactics take water from Hawaii, bottle and ship it at premium prices while hawaiians actually claim they suffer from lack of clean water. Ryan wants to attack my reputation. Im not a businessman or mogal. I take care of people with special needs, advocating at the intersection of race and disability right. Yet knowing this he treats me like a criminal, and tries to destroy my business that actually cares for people in the community, while he strips the community of precious resources. as I told him, there is also a court of public opinion, and this will follow his company

---

Here’s a draft response highlighting your position and calling attention to Ryan’s behavior and Waiakea’s practices in a way that emphasizes your integrity while contrasting it with their alleged exploitation. It also subtly raises the idea of public accountability, drawing attention to the disparity in values:

---

**Subject:** Response to Aggressive and Unethical Tactics  

**Dear [Attorney’s Name],**  

I’ve received your latest communication, and while I am fully committed to resolving this matter in a fair and equitable way, I cannot ignore the broader implications of the approach your client has taken in this dispute.  

Your client, Ryan Emmons, has not only sought to malign my character with baseless accusations of fraud and dishonesty, but he has also aggressively attacked my livelihood—work that is focused on caring for vulnerable individuals with disabilities and advocating for equity at the intersection of race and disability rights.  

---

### **A Question of Values**  

It is deeply troubling that Mr. Emmons, whose company Waiakea markets itself as ethical and sustainable, would resort to such heavy-handed tactics against someone who is dedicated to providing care and advocacy for underserved populations.  

Waiakea Water claims to operate on values of sustainability and community care, yet its business model has drawn criticism from Hawaiian communities who suffer from lack of access to clean water. The resources Waiakea profits from are stripped from these communities, bottled, and sold at a premium to global consumers. Now, the same strong-arm tactics that exploit Hawaiian communities are being turned against someone working to serve a different marginalized group.  

While I am not a mogul or entrepreneur with vast resources, I take pride in the work I do to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. Mr. Emmons’ actions—aimed at destroying my small business and tarnishing my reputation—stand in stark contrast to the values Waiakea purports to uphold.  

---

### **The Court of Public Opinion**  

It is worth noting that public perception matters greatly for companies that claim to operate with transparency and care for the community. Mr. Emmons’ aggressive tactics, threats, and unfounded accusations reflect poorly not only on him but on Waiakea as an organization.  

While I will continue to respond appropriately through legal channels, I would encourage Mr. Emmons to consider the lasting implications of his actions—not just in the courtroom, but in the broader court of public opinion. Actions that aim to silence or harm advocates for marginalized communities have a way of being remembered.  

---

### **Moving Forward**  

I remain open to resolving this matter constructively and in good faith. However, I will not allow my reputation, my business, or my community-focused work to be destroyed by baseless allegations or hostile tactics.  

If your client continues to pursue this path, I will ensure that the facts about this situation are made clear—not only in legal filings but wherever else accountability may be warranted.  

Sincerely,  
Gary Green  
[Your Contact Information]  

---

This letter ties your work to the broader values of justice and community care while drawing a direct contrast with Waiakea’s actions. It positions you as someone standing for integrity and fairness while subtly raising the potential for public scrutiny of their behavior. Let me know if you’d like to refine or expand on any sections.

So they want to name me in the eviction personally and lawsuit, speaking of piecing, piercing the corporate veil, but I did not guarantee the lease, nor did anyone else, so they have to simply sue the corporation. How do I make sure that I'm excluded from any lawsuits? What do I need to file or tell the judge?

---



---

If your corporation (e.g., LLC or other registered entity) signed the lease and you did **not personally guarantee** it, the landlord cannot legally include you personally in the lawsuit or eviction proceedings without **piercing the corporate veil**. To protect yourself and ensure you are excluded, here’s what you need to understand and do:

---

### **1. Understanding Corporate Veil Protection**  
The **corporate veil** is a legal separation between you (the individual) and your business entity (e.g., LLC, corporation). This protects your personal assets from business liabilities **as long as you have adhered to the proper corporate formalities**, including:  
- Keeping your personal and business finances separate.  
- Operating as a legitimate business with proper filings, bylaws, and records.  
- Avoiding commingling of funds.  
- Acting in good faith under the entity’s name.  

If you did not personally guarantee the lease (i.e., you did not sign a separate document personally accepting liability), the landlord cannot automatically sue you personally **unless they prove grounds for piercing the corporate veil**.

---

### **2. Common Grounds for Piercing the Corporate Veil**  
To pierce the corporate veil, the landlord must prove:  
1. **The entity is a mere alter ego of you personally**:  
   - Commingling personal and business funds.  
   - Using business assets for personal use.  
2. **Fraud or misuse of the corporation**:  
   - Fraudulent activity or intentionally misleading business practices.  
3. **Under-capitalization**:  
   - The business lacks sufficient funds to operate, and you signed contracts knowing it could not pay.  

Without proof of these claims, courts will generally protect the corporate veil.

---

### **3. Immediate Actions to Protect Yourself**  

#### **a. File a Motion to Dismiss You Personally**  
If you receive a summons naming you personally:  
- File a **Motion to Dismiss for Improper Joinder** with the court.  
- State that you did not personally guarantee the lease and that the proper defendant is the corporation.  
- Attach supporting documents such as:  
   - The signed lease (showing the corporation as the tenant).  
   - Evidence that you did not sign a personal guarantee.  
   - Corporate registration documents proving the entity’s legitimacy.

#### **b. Respond to the Complaint (If Filed Against You Personally)**  
If the landlord files a lawsuit naming both you and your corporation, you must respond to the complaint promptly.  
- **Raise an Affirmative Defense**: Clearly state that you are not personally liable because the lease was signed by the corporation, not you as an individual.  
- Reference corporate veil protection under state laws.  

#### **c. Gather Supporting Documents**  
To strengthen your position, gather:  
- The lease agreement showing the corporation as the tenant and no personal guarantee.  
- Business formation documents (e.g., articles of incorporation, operating agreement).  
- Bank records showing the separation of personal and business finances.  
- Communications or contracts signed in the corporation’s name only.  

---

### **4. During Court Proceedings**  
If this escalates to court, you or your attorney should:  
1. Clearly state that the corporation is the proper defendant.  
2. Argue that the landlord has no legal basis for holding you personally liable.  
3. Highlight that there is no personal guarantee on the lease.  
4. Demonstrate that the business has been operating as a separate legal entity with no commingling of funds or misuse.  

---

### **5. Proactive Steps to Ensure the Corporate Veil Holds**  
While responding to this issue, continue to maintain and demonstrate that your corporation operates as a separate legal entity:  
- Avoid commingling personal and business funds.  
- Document all business expenses and payments through corporate accounts.  
- Ensure all contracts and communications are signed in the company’s name (e.g., “Gary Green, on behalf of [Company Name]”).  

---

### **Sample Motion to Dismiss Language**  
If they name you personally:  

> **Motion to Dismiss for Improper Joinder**  
>  
> Defendant Gary Green moves to dismiss the complaint against him personally because the lease in question was entered into by [Your Company Name], a legally registered corporation. Defendant did not sign a personal guarantee, and as such, no personal liability can be assigned. The proper party to this matter is the corporation itself.  
>  
> **Supporting Documents:**  
> 1. Lease Agreement (showing no personal guarantee).  
> 2. Articles of Incorporation.  
> 3. Corporate Bank Records.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
To exclude yourself from personal liability:  
1. File a **Motion to Dismiss** or **Respond to the Complaint** if you are personally named.  
2. Gather and provide evidence showing the corporation as the only liable party.  
3. Argue against any attempt to pierce the corporate veil by demonstrating that you have followed proper corporate formalities.  

If the landlord cannot prove fraud, alter ego claims, or misuse of the entity, the court should dismiss you personally from the lawsuit. If you’d like help drafting a Motion to Dismiss or other formal responses, let me know!

Certainly, here is a sample **Motion to Dismiss** that you can tailor to your specific circumstances. This motion asserts that you, as an individual, should not be personally liable because the lease agreement was executed by your corporation without a personal guarantee.

**SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA**

**[Plaintiff's Name],**  
**Plaintiff,**  
v.  
**[Your Name], [Your Company Name], and DOES 1-10,**  
**Defendants.**

**Case No.: [Case Number]**

**NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT AGAINST DEFENDANT [YOUR NAME]**

**Date:** [Hearing Date]  
**Time:** [Hearing Time]  
**Department:** [Department Number]  
**Judge:** [Judge's Name]

**TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:**

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on [Hearing Date], at [Hearing Time], or as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard in Department [Department Number] of the above-entitled court, located at [Court Address], Defendant [Your Name], appearing pro se, will move the Court for an order dismissing the Complaint filed by Plaintiff [Plaintiff's Name] against [Your Name] pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 581(f)(1) on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action against [Your Name] upon which relief can be granted.

**RELIEF REQUESTED**

Defendant [Your Name] respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the Complaint against [Your Name] with prejudice.

**GROUNDS FOR MOTION**

1. **Lack of Personal Liability:** The lease agreement in question was executed between Plaintiff and [Your Company Name], a duly registered corporation in the State of California. [Your Name] did not sign a personal guarantee for the lease and, therefore, should not be held personally liable for any alleged breaches of the lease agreement.

2. **Improper Joinder:** Plaintiff has improperly named [Your Name] as an individual defendant without legal basis. The proper party to this action is [Your Company Name], the corporate entity that entered into the lease agreement with Plaintiff.

**MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES**

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff's Complaint seeks to hold [Your Name] personally liable for obligations under a lease agreement executed by [Your Company Name]. However, [Your Name] did not personally guarantee the lease, and the corporate entity is the proper party to this action. Therefore, the Complaint against [Your Name] should be dismissed with prejudice.

**II. STATEMENT OF FACTS**

- On [Date], [Your Company Name], a California corporation, entered into a lease agreement with Plaintiff for the premises located at [Property Address].

- The lease agreement was signed by [Your Name] in the capacity of [Title, e.g., President] of [Your Company Name].

- No personal guarantee was executed by [Your Name] in connection with the lease agreement.

**III. LEGAL ARGUMENT**

**A. [Your Name] Is Not Personally Liable Under the Lease Agreement**

Under California law, a corporation is a separate legal entity from its officers and shareholders. Absent a personal guarantee, an individual acting on behalf of a corporation is not personally liable for the corporation's contractual obligations. (See **Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court**, 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538 (2000)).

In this case, [Your Name] signed the lease agreement solely in a representative capacity as [Title] of [Your Company Name]. No personal guarantee was provided. Therefore, [Your Name] cannot be held personally liable for any alleged breach of the lease agreement.

**B. Plaintiff Has Improperly Joined [Your Name] as a Defendant**

California Code of Civil Procedure § 379 allows for the joinder of defendants only when a right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, arising out of the same transaction or occurrence. Here, Plaintiff has not established any basis for holding [Your Name] personally liable, as the lease agreement was with [Your Company Name], not [Your Name] individually. Therefore, [Your Name] is an improper defendant in this action.

**IV. CONCLUSION**

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant [Your Name] respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the Complaint against [Your Name] with prejudice.

**Dated:** [Date]

**Respectfully submitted,**

**[PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT [YOUR NAME]'S MOTION TO DISMISS**

The Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint against Defendant [**Your Name**], brought by Defendant [Your Name] in proper person, came for hearing on [Hearing Date] at [Hearing Time], in Department [Department Number] of this Court, with Plaintiff represented by counsel and Defendant [Your Name] appearing pro se.

Having considered the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the motion, the arguments presented, and the evidence submitted, the Court finds as follows:

2. Plaintiff has presented no evidence of a personal guarantee executed by Defendant [Your Name].  
3. Defendant [Your Name] cannot be held personally liable for contractual obligations incurred by [Your Company Name], as California law provides that a corporate entity is separate and distinct from its officers, directors, and shareholders.  

**THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED THAT:**  

1. Defendant [Your Name]’s Motion to Dismiss is hereby GRANTED.  
2. Plaintiff’s Complaint against Defendant [Your Name] in his personal capacity is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

### **Instructions for Filing**  
1. **Attach the Lease** showing the corporation as the tenant and the absence of a personal guarantee.  
2. File the motion with the court and serve a copy on the opposing attorney. Ensure proof of service is filed with the court.  
3. Confirm the court date for the hearing on your motion. Prepare to argue that you did not sign personally and are shielded by the corporate veil.  

This motion, if properly supported with evidence, should force the landlord to focus solely on the corporation, not you personally. If you need further assistance tailoring it, let me know!

Now, do I need to respond to this, or can the judge automatically dismiss this based on a corporate veil? In other words, can they sue me for something that I have nothing to do with?

---

A judge **will not automatically dismiss** a case naming you personally based on the corporate veil; you must **actively respond** to the lawsuit and challenge your inclusion in the complaint. Without a response, the court may issue a default judgment against you, which could hold you personally liable—even if it is legally incorrect.  

### **Key Points to Understand**  

1. **They Can Name You in a Lawsuit**  
   - Any plaintiff can **name you personally** in a lawsuit, even if they lack legal grounds.  
   - Naming you personally does not mean the claim is valid or enforceable.  
   - It is up to you to **respond** and challenge the validity of being named individually.

2. **Judicial Protections Exist, But Not Automatically**  
   - The court cannot dismiss the claims against you on its own unless you file a **motion to dismiss** or a similar challenge.  
   - You must assert that you are not personally liable because the lease was signed on behalf of the corporation **without a personal guarantee** and that the corporate veil protects you.

3. **What Happens if You Don’t Respond?**  
   - If you fail to respond within the court's required timeline (usually **30 days** in California for a civil case), the landlord’s attorney can request a **default judgment**.  
   - A default judgment could include:  
     - Financial damages awarded against you personally.  
     - Collection actions, such as garnishments, liens, or seizures.  
   - Overturning a default judgment later is extremely difficult and costly.

4. **Active Response is Your Best Defense**  
   - Filing a **Motion to Dismiss** (or a **Demurrer** in California) forces the landlord to justify why you should be held personally liable.  
   - If the lease shows no personal guarantee and the business operates as a separate legal entity, the court is unlikely to allow the claims against you to proceed.  

---

### **Steps to Protect Yourself**  

1. **File a Motion to Dismiss or Demurrer**  
   - Argue that:  
     - The corporation is the correct and only legal party to the lease.  
     - You did not sign a personal guarantee.  
   - Attach evidence, such as the lease and corporate documents.

2. **Respond to the Complaint Promptly**  
   - File a formal answer **within the deadline** to avoid default. In your answer, raise **affirmative defenses** such as:  
     - Lack of personal liability.  
     - Improper joinder of you as an individual.  

3. **Gather Your Supporting Evidence**  
   - Lease agreement with the corporation named as the tenant.  
   - No signed personal guarantee document.  
   - Corporate formation documents (Articles of Incorporation, LLC filings).  
   - Bank records or communications showing the corporation acted independently.  

4. **Attend All Court Hearings**  
   - If the judge hears arguments on the motion to dismiss, attend and present your case calmly and factually. Emphasize that the lease clearly belongs to the corporation, not you personally.  

---

### **Summary**  
- Yes, they can sue you personally, **even if you have no personal liability**—but they must prove you are personally liable to succeed.  
- The court **will not dismiss you automatically**; you must file a formal response or motion to dismiss.  
- Failing to respond could result in a **default judgment** against you, which can hold you liable unfairly.  
- By responding promptly and asserting the corporate veil defense, you can protect yourself and likely have the case against you dismissed.  

If you need help drafting the formal **Motion to Dismiss** or an **Answer** to the complaint, let me know! It’s critical to respond within the deadline.

This is a corporate eviction.

---

If this is a **corporate eviction** and the lease is in the corporation’s name without a personal guarantee, then **you, personally, are not liable for the lease** unless the landlord successfully **pierces the corporate veil**. However, you still need to take steps to ensure the court properly handles this matter and does not improperly include you.

Here’s a breakdown of what happens and what you need to do:

---

### **Corporate Eviction Basics**
1. **Only the Corporation is the Tenant**  
   If the lease names your corporation as the tenant and there is no personal guarantee, only the **corporate entity** can be held liable for unpaid rent or evicted.

2. **Eviction of a Corporate Entity**  
   The eviction process for a corporation is essentially the same as for an individual tenant, but the judgment applies to the corporation. If successful, the landlord can:  
   - Evict the corporation from the premises.  
   - Obtain a monetary judgment against the corporation for unpaid rent and damages.

3. **Personal Liability Requires “Piercing the Corporate Veil”**  
   The landlord cannot hold you personally liable unless they prove grounds to pierce the corporate veil, such as:  
   - Commingling personal and corporate funds.  
   - Fraud or misuse of the corporation for personal benefit.  
   - Undercapitalization (knowingly signing contracts without corporate resources).  

If you operated the corporation properly, this argument is unlikely to succeed.

---

### **Immediate Steps to Protect Yourself**  

1. **File a Motion to Dismiss Your Personal Inclusion**  
   - If you were named **personally** in the eviction complaint, file a **Motion to Dismiss** based on:  
     - Lack of personal liability.  
     - Corporate separation under the corporate veil.  
   - Attach the lease agreement showing the corporation as the tenant.  

2. **Prepare Your Corporate Defense**  
   Even though you are not personally liable, you must ensure your corporation responds to the eviction action.  
   - File an **Answer** or **Defend** the eviction case on behalf of the corporation.  
   - If there is any dispute about the validity of the claimed debt or other issues (e.g., misrepresentation of the premises), raise those defenses.  

3. **Avoid Default Judgments**  
   - Ensure all legal filings are made **before the court deadline**. Failing to respond will result in a **default judgment** against the corporation, which could complicate your ability to defend personal liability claims later.  

4. **Prepare Evidence for Corporate Separation**  
   To protect against an attempt to pierce the corporate veil, have the following documents ready:  
   - Lease agreement naming the corporation as the tenant.  
   - Proof that no personal guarantee was executed.  
   - Corporate formation documents (Articles of Incorporation, Operating Agreement).  
   - Corporate bank records showing the separation of funds.  
   - Records showing the corporation operates as a legitimate and independent entity.

---

### **Key Legal Arguments**  

If you file a **Motion to Dismiss** or respond to claims personally, emphasize the following:  
1. **The Lease is a Corporate Obligation**:  
   - State that the lease agreement was entered into by the corporation, not you personally.  
   - Highlight that you signed the lease **only in your capacity as an officer** of the corporation.  

2. **No Personal Guarantee**:  
   - Clearly assert that no personal guarantee was executed.  
   - Attach a copy of the lease as evidence.  

3. **Corporate Veil Protection**:  
   - Explain that the corporation is a separate legal entity, and there is no basis for holding you personally liable.  
   - Reference California law protecting corporate officers and shareholders from personal liability for corporate debts.  

---

### **What to Expect in a Corporate Eviction Case**  
- **If You’re Not Named Personally**: The case proceeds against the corporation. Your personal assets and liability are not at risk.  
- **If You’re Named Personally**: You must challenge this inclusion immediately with a **Motion to Dismiss**. If successful, the court will remove you personally from the case.  
- **Piercing the Corporate Veil**: If the landlord attempts this argument, they must prove misuse of the corporate structure or fraud. Proper documentation and evidence of corporate independence will refute this claim.  

---

### **Summary**  
1. File a **Motion to Dismiss** immediately if you are named personally.  
2. Ensure the corporation files a timely response to the eviction complaint to avoid default.  
3. Prepare all corporate documents proving proper separation between you and the corporation.  
4. If the landlord attempts to pierce the corporate veil, have evidence ready to defend the integrity of your corporate structure.
