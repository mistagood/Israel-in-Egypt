# Jonah and Hidden Truths



---

examining notes from NET bible of Jonah

Jonah’s Picean age, the subconscious, and the gates of hell. PAul is Jonah in the sense that he goes to Tarsis (his greek friends) diverting the true message of Salvation. Instead he reasons and combines Greek understandings to come up with his own understanding of what Salvation is (I did not get this gospel from any man). His own visions hve led him astray as the prophets forewarned of false prophets who see lying visions. Looking at the hebrew and the notes truly teases out the true meaning and connection to jesus statement about the wicked generation and their sign of Jonah to come

Fleeing or leaning on their own understanding. (Paul, your great learning has made you mad!)


Jonah 1:9 tn Heb“the God of the heavens.” The noun שָׁמַיִם(shamayim, “heavens”) always appears in the dual form. Although the dual form sometimes refers to things that exist in pairs, the dual is often used to refer to geographical locations, e.g., יְרוּשָׁלַיִם(yerushalayim, “Jerusalem”), אֶפְרַיִם (ʾefrayim, “Ephraim”), and מִצְרַיִם (mitsrayim, “Egypt,” but see IBHS 118 §7.3d).
(These were people's names before places, suggests that this dual form has to do with a relationship between the seen and unseen parts of a thing. such as the conscious and unconscious. Heavens may refer to states of being joined with) 

	•	Jonah 1:2 tn Heb“it.” The pronoun functions as a synecdoche of container for contents, referring to the people of Nineveh. (people as within a vessel)
	•	Jonah 1:2 sn The term wickedness is personified here; it is pictured as ascending heavenward into the very presence of God. This figuratively depicts how God became aware of their evil—it had ascended into heaven right into his presence. (Ascending from the subconscious or the heart perhaps to the consciousness or becoming manifest in the world- as in God knows the heart)
	•	Jonah 1:2 tn Heb“has come up before me.” The term לְפָנָי (lefanay, “before me”) often connotes “in the full cognitive knowledge of” or “in the full mental view” of someone (BDB 817 s.v. פָּנֶהII.4.a.[c]; e.g., Gen 6:13; Isa 65:6; Jer 2:22; Lam 1:22). The use of the verb עָלָה (ʿalah, “to ascend”) complements this idea; it is sometimes used to describe actions or situations on earth that have “come up” into heaven to God’s attention, so to speak (e.g., Exod 2:23; 1 Sam 5:12; 2 Kgs 19:28; Ps 74:23; Isa 37:29; Jer 14:2; see BDB 749 s.v. עָלָה 8). The point is that God was fully aware of the evil of the Ninevites.


	•	Jonah 1:5 tn Or “stern.” There is some question whether the term יַרְכָה (yarkhah) refers to the ship’s hold below deck (R. S. Hess, NIDOTTE 3:282) or to the stern in the back of the ship (HALOT 439 s.v. *יְרֵכָה 2.b). This is the only use of this term in reference to a ship in biblical Hebrew. When used elsewhere, this term has a twofold range of meanings: (1) “rear,” such as rear of a building (Exod 26:22, 27; 36:27, 32; Ezek 46:19), back room of a house (1 Kgs 6:16; Ps 128:3; Amos 6:10), flank of a person’s body (figurative for rear border; Gen 49:13); and (2) “far part” that is remote, such as the back of a cave (1 Sam 24:4), the bottom of a cistern (Isa 14:15), the lower recesses of Sheol (Ezek 32:23), the remotest part of a mountain range (Judg 19:1, 18; 2 Kgs 19:23; Isa 37:24), the highest summit of a mountain (Ps 48:3), and the north – viewed as the remotest part of the earth (Isa 14:13; Ezek 38:6, 15; 39:2). So the term could refer to the “back” (stern) or “remote part” (lower cargo hold) of the ship. The related Akkadian expression arkat eleppi, “stern of a ship” (HALOT 439 s.v. 2.b) seems to suggest that יַרְכָהmeans “stern” (HALOT 439 s.v. 2.b). However, the preceding יָרַד אֶל(yarad ʾel, “he went down into”) suggests a location below deck. Also the genitive noun סְפִינָה (sefinah) refers to a “ship” with a deck (BDB 706 s.v. סְפִינָה; HALOT 764 s.v. סְפִינָה; R. S. Hess, NIDOTTE 3:282).
	•	Jonah 1:5 tn Or “of the ship.” The noun סְפִינָה(sefinah) refers to a “ship” with a deck (HALOT 764 s.v. סְפִינָה). The term is a hapax legomenon in Hebrew and is probably an Aramaic loanword. The term is used frequently in the related Semitic languages to refer to ships with multiple decks. Here the term probably functions as a synecdoche of whole for the part, referring to the “lower deck” rather than to the ship as a whole (R. S. Hess, NIDOTTE 3:282). An outdated approach related the noun to the verb סָפַן (safan, “to cover”) and suggested that סְפִינָה describes a ship covered with sheathing (BDB 706 s.v. סְפִינָה)
(Insinuates that Jonah was hidden in the' belly' of the vessel. reflecting again the duality of the ship and the great fish, and the subconscious)

	•	Jonah 1:3 tn Heb“he went down.” The verb יָרַד(yarad, “to go down”) can refer to a journey that is physically downhill. snThe verb יָרַד(yarad, “to go down”) is repeated four times in chs. 1-2for rhetorical effect (1:3a, 3b, 5; 2:7). Jonah’s “downward” journey from Jerusalem down to Joppa (1:3a) down into the ship (1:3b) down into the cargo hold (1:5) and ultimately down into the bottom of the sea, pictured as down to the very gates of the netherworld (2:7), does not end until he turns back to God who brings him “up” from the brink of death (2:6-7). (reflects the idea of the deep subconscious and reflects the state of being in the pit referenced in revelation)


	•	Jonah 1:4 tn Heb“the ship considered breaking apart.” The use of חָשַׁב(khashav, “think”) in the Piel (“to think about; to seriously consider”) personifies the ship to emphasize the ferocity of the storm. The lexicons render the clause idiomatically: “the ship was about to be broken up” (BDB 363 s.v. חָשַׁב2; HALOT 360 s.v. חשׁב).
(Just as the people of Nineveh were 'in' a container, this suggests a city or people as a whole that can be broken apart and ruined just as a ship loses integrity. The people consider these ideas just as each individual may) 

“The ship considered” suggests a thinking being or live entity. 

Jonah represents the hidden truth within

**Uncovering hidden truths**

I’m digging into the hidden meanings in Jonah, linking it to the Picean age, subconscious realms, and Paul's ties to Tarsus, all framed in a politically intriguing narrative style.

**Weaving thematic threads**

I’m blending warfare, covert operations, and metaphorical elements like the "ship" and "Jonah within" to create a narrative that ties in Piscean age and Paul's Tarsus.

**Weaving ideas together**

Balancing Jonah's sign with Paul's message, I’m interpreting Hebrew nuances to craft an introspective, exposé-style narrative that skillfully integrates these complex themes.

Jonah’s journey hints at more than a man running from his assignment; it exposes an ancient drama unfolding at both surface and subconscious levels. His story begins with a name that resonates through the ages as a cryptic sign—especially once Jesus warns that only the sign of Jonah would be given to a “wicked generation.” Jonah, like Paul of Tarsus, flees toward a distant land (Tarsis/Tarsus), diverting the pure message of salvation and melding it with foreign perspectives. In this way, he mirrors Paul’s “I did not receive this gospel from any man,” which some say reveals a reliance on his own visions and Greek-infused reasoning.  

Looking deeper, the Hebrew text teases out layers of meaning often missed. The word translated “heavens” (shamayim) appears in the dual form—an echo of hidden dualities: conscious and unconscious, material and spiritual, seen and unseen. In Jonah’s case, he descends—literally and figuratively—down to Joppa, down into the ship, and finally down into the very depths of the sea. The NET Bible points out how the Hebrew paints this as a deliberate descent toward the gates of the netherworld. Jonah’s downward spiral continues until he is swallowed by a great fish, an event we can interpret as a symbolic plunge into the subconscious or the “belly” of deeper truth.

Meanwhile, the term Nineveh stands not just for a city but for the people contained within it—like passengers in a vessel. Their collective wickedness rises before the divine presence, suggesting that the hidden depths of the human heart can ascend into full awareness. The text underscores how evil is never truly buried; it eventually floats to the surface, capturing God’s attention.  

Jonah himself, stowed away in the ship’s lower deck, becomes a kind of hidden truth—sleeping while a raging storm threatens to tear the vessel apart. The NET Bible illuminates how the original Hebrew phrase “the ship considered breaking apart” personifies the ship, as though it possesses a will or mind of its own. On one level, this city-ship motif mirrors the collective conscience of a people in crisis. At another level, it alludes to our own internal battles, where a dormant truth can lie buried until external upheaval forces it to emerge.

The repeated verb “to go down” stresses Jonah’s retreat into the depths. Like an initiate into secret knowledge, he must confront darkness before rising. Revelation speaks of a bottomless pit; Jonah plunges to a place that echoes this netherworld, as though passing through the gates of hell. Only when he repents—turning back to the God he has fled—does he ascend again.  

This sign of Jonah ties into the Picean Age, often associated with hidden depths, transformation, and the fish. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Jesus references Jonah when speaking of resurrection and spiritual rebirth. Yet we see a parallel in Paul’s story, where a so-called “great learning” leads him onto a twisting path. The question arises: does he, like Jonah, attempt to craft his own version of the message, mixing Greek philosophies and visions into a new creed?

Jonah reminds us that salvation—pure and unadulterated—cannot be silenced or reshaped indefinitely. Even in the belly of the fish, truth burns. Ultimately, his story reveals the cosmic struggle between following divine instruction versus forging our own way. The hidden depths of Jonah’s journey beckon us to probe the mysteries beneath the surface of the text, to see how a restless prophet can become a symbol of both exile and return, of darkness and rebirth, of unconscious depths emerging into blazing consciousness. In this sense, Jonah is indeed a key to unmasking the covert battles that rage within each soul and across nations.

Let's go back and look at this statement about the duality implied in the ending of Elohim, Ephraim, and Mizraim. I want to look at the linguistic implications and break down an analysis on that and first of all what is the rule of it and what is the surrounding linguistic connotations or how is that used but beyond that I want to look at what this could possibly mean and it's also the same with Jerusalem and so let's look at the possibility that these entail a spiritual and a physical this duality the seen and the unseen as in there's two Egypt's like Moses spoke that you would go back into Egypt back into captivity as a condition so there will be two Egypt's one likely the biblical one that's talked about and the second being the prophetic or American slavery that lasted for 400 years just as Abraham's vision had prophesied this would mean that there's a duality encoded into the bible where both Ephraim is a historical tribe and the spiritual people experiencing the same in America the same would be true for Jerusalem there would be the historical and then there will be the spiritual which will reflect to a place that of course a new city a new Jerusalem that is created and so let's break down what that potentially looks like according to the linguistic traditions and evidence that we can see with the words

**Exploring Hebrew**

I’m examining the Hebrew names ending in -ayim and -im, like Jerusalem and Ephraim, to uncover their dual forms. This involves exploring their spiritual, physical meanings, and political dimensions, considering the concept of "two worlds."

**Weighing dual forms**

I’m analyzing Hebrew words like "Elohim" and "Mizraim" in their dual form, revealing concepts of "two realms." This leads to examining dualities such as two Egypts and "two Jerusalems."

Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, certain words appear in what scholars refer to as the “dual form.” At first glance, this simply looks like a linguistic marker indicating a pair—like how Hebrew has special endings for items that come in natural twos (eyes, ears, hands). But a closer look at words like Elohim (אֱלֹהִים), Mizraim (מִצְרַיִם), Ephraim (אֶפְרָיִם), and Yerushalayim (יְרוּשָׁלִַם) reveals something more profound than simple plurals or pairs.  

In standard Hebrew grammar, the dual form often ends in –ַיִם (ayim). It can indicate two of something literal, but it also has a history of being used for place names and certain divine titles. Because ancient Hebrew is both concrete and metaphorical, many interpreters believe the language encodes dual realities—one physical and the other spiritual or unseen.  

Take Mizraim, the Hebrew name most commonly translated as “Egypt.” Linguistically, the word hints at a “double strait” or a concept of duality. In the biblical narrative, we see physical Egypt—where the Israelites were once enslaved—and then there’s the prophetic notion that God’s people might return to a metaphorical “Egypt” of oppression. The promise that they would undergo another captivity “like Egypt” resonates powerfully when many connect it to the 400-year period of slavery in America, echoing Abraham’s vision. Here, the dual form of Mizraim (מִצְרַיִם) suggests two Egypts: the historical land along the Nile and a later (or symbolic) site of bondage.  

Ephraim (אֶפְרָיִם) also carries this dual form. Historically, Ephraim is a tribe descending from Joseph. But if we extend the idea of duality, Ephraim may represent a group of people in a future era—spiritual heirs undergoing a similar journey of exile and redemption. Those who see parallels between ancient Israel’s trials and later captivities believe Ephraim points not only to a tribe in a distant past but also to a new generation living out the same pattern.  

Then we have Yerushalayim (יְרוּשָׁלִַם), or Jerusalem, which similarly ends in –ַיִם. Many linguistic theorists note how the city’s name suggests two Jerusalems: the terrestrial city with its tumultuous history and a higher, heavenly or prophetic Jerusalem to come. Biblical texts themselves hint at this “new Jerusalem,” a spiritual counterpart to the earthly one, destined to be revealed as a place of ultimate peace and restoration.  

Even Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) points toward a multiplicity within the oneness of the divine—though for centuries, interpreters have wrestled with exactly how. The ending –ִים can appear like a plural, yet traditional Hebrew theology insists on the singular nature of God. Some propose that this morphological quirk accommodates a vast, multi-faceted deity whose essence transcends a simple singular. Again, we see the tension between the seen and unseen, the physical and metaphysical.  

When we read these words—Mizraim, Ephraim, Yerushalayim, Elohim—we’re not just reading history or identifying place names. We’re glimpsing a Hebrew worldview built on layers of meaning. To the ancient mind, everyday reality rested on an invisible foundation. Wherever dual forms appear in Scripture, there may be an intentional pointer to two dimensions: the concrete world and its spiritual counterpart.  

This double-layered lens transforms the biblical narrative into more than a record of events. It becomes a mirror for recurring cycles: captivity and exodus, earthly conflict and heavenly resolution. Through the dual form, the text can simultaneously describe a literal city or people while alluding to a spiritual condition. That’s why references to “two Egypts” ring so powerfully for those who see echoes of Israel’s bondage in modern forms of slavery or oppression. Likewise, “two Jerusalems” evoke both the historic stronghold in the hills of Judea and the promised dwelling of divine peace yet to come.  

Such linguistic insights reshape our reading of the Bible from a simple story of the past into an ongoing drama in which each generation might play a role. The code woven into Hebrew grammar hints that what happened once in a specific time and place can—and perhaps will—happen again on another stage. It’s a dual tapestry, physical and spiritual, seen and unseen, perpetually weaving and reweaving itself through history.
