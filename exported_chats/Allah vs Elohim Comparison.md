# Allah vs Elohim Comparison

Is Allah the same word as Elohim only in Arabic? And is this the word that Moses uses for the individual or the Lord spoke to him

The word "Allah" in Arabic and "Elohim" in Hebrew are indeed related, but they are not exactly the same word. They both refer to the divine but differ in linguistic context, etymology, and theological connotation.

### Understanding "Allah" and "Elohim"

1. **Allah in Arabic:**
   - "Allah" is the Arabic word for God. It is derived from the Arabic root "ʾL-H" (أ ل ه), which means "to be worshipped" or "deity." The term "Allah" is a contraction of "al-ilāh," which means "the God." It is used by Muslims, Arabic-speaking Christians, and Jews to refer to the one, singular God.
   - In the Islamic tradition, "Allah" is the proper name for God, emphasizing His uniqueness and oneness (Tawhid). It does not have a plural form, reinforcing the concept of monotheism.

2. **Elohim in Hebrew:**
   - "Elohim" is a Hebrew word for God, commonly used in the Old Testament. It is derived from the root "ʾL-H" (א ל ה) in Hebrew, similar to its Arabic counterpart, which also means "god" or "deity."
   - However, "Elohim" is plural in form but is usually used with singular verbs when referring to the God of Israel, signifying a majestic or divine plurality, often interpreted as the "plural of majesty." This can denote God's power, authority, or completeness.
   - "Elohim" is a more general term in the Hebrew Bible and can refer to other gods, judges, or powerful beings, depending on the context.

### Moses and the Name of God

In the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Torah, Moses interacts with God, and various names are used to denote the divine:

1. **YHWH (Yahweh):**
   - This is the personal and covenantal name of God, often rendered as "the LORD" in English translations. It is considered the most sacred name, revealed to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14) as "I AM WHO I AM" (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh). YHWH emphasizes God's eternal existence and His relationship with Israel.

2. **Elohim:**
   - This term is also used frequently in the Hebrew Bible to refer to God, especially in contexts that speak of God's power, justice, and creation. For instance, Genesis 1 uses "Elohim" to describe God's creation of the world.

In Moses' interactions, "Elohim" is sometimes used in conjunction with "YHWH," such as "YHWH Elohim," translated as "The LORD God," combining the personal and more general names of God to emphasize both the covenantal and powerful aspects of God's nature.

### Conclusion

While "Allah" and "Elohim" share a common Semitic root and a conceptual overlap as names for God, they are not the same word. "Allah" is a specific term in Arabic for the singular God, whereas "Elohim" is a Hebrew word with a broader semantic range and is often used in conjunction with YHWH when referring to the God of Israel. Moses primarily uses "YHWH" (the LORD) in direct dialogue with God, while "Elohim" is also used to express God's majesty and power.

I am aware that there are two separate words that’s not what I’m asking. I’m looking at the roots and the common somatic route and so are you saying that they both are from the root LH or L-H

---

Yes, you are correct in looking at the roots. Both "Allah" in Arabic and "Elohim" in Hebrew indeed share a common Semitic root. The root for both words can be traced back to **ʾL-H** or **L-H**, which is a shared root across several Semitic languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Arabic Root "ʾL-H" (أ ل ه):**
   - In Arabic, the root "ʾL-H" relates to divinity or deity. From this root, we get the word "Ilah" (إله), which means "god" or "deity." The definite form "al-Ilah" (the God) contracts into "Allah," the standard word for God in Arabic.

2. **Hebrew Root "ʾL-H" (א ל ה):**
   - In Hebrew, the root "ʾL-H" similarly pertains to divinity. The word "Eloah" (אֱלוֹהַּ) is a singular form meaning "god" or "deity." "Elohim" (אֱלֹהִים), which is the plural form, is the more commonly used word for God in the Hebrew Bible. Despite its plural form, it often takes a singular meaning when referring to the God of Israel, denoting majesty or greatness.

### Common Semitic Root: LH or L-H

Both "Allah" and "Elohim" derive from the same Proto-Semitic root **ʾL** (meaning "god" or "deity"), with an additional consonant "H" in their linguistic structures (**ʾL-H**). This root appears in various forms across different Semitic languages:

- **Arabic**: "ʾL-H" (ilah, Allah)
- **Hebrew**: "ʾL-H" (eloah, elohim)
- **Aramaic**: "Elaha" (ܐܠܗܐ), which is similar to "Eloah" in Hebrew and also means "God."

### Conclusion

Yes, both "Allah" and "Elohim" share the common Semitic root **ʾL-H**. This root expresses the concept of divinity across Semitic languages, and while the words evolved differently in Arabic and Hebrew, their origin in this root reflects a shared linguistic and cultural heritage in understanding the divine.
