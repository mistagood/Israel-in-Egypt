What is the star of David formation in astrology?

---

The Star of David formation in astrology is a specific pattern that appears in a horoscope chart. It involves two interlocking grand trines (a grand trine is a pattern formed when three planets are each 120 degrees apart), which create a six-pointed star or hexagram. This formation is thought to bring positive energy and opportunities. However, the interpretation of the Star of David formation can vary widely based on the specific planets and signs involved.
