Recognizing False Prophets, You Know Them From Their Fruits. So, this will be a lesson about identifying false prophets, and looking at the works, and what the scriptures have to say about a prophet, and how you recognize a false prophet, or whether the prophet has the word of the Lord. So, Moses talks about this, and the first thing is if a prophet says something and it doesn't come true, then that prophet is not speaking from the Lord. Now, before that, Moses had already told you, if a prophet comes and he does signs, even if they happen, if he tells you to follow something other than what Moses is telling you, then he is trying to lead you away from God. If you worship any other god, you're not loving God with all your heart, and that is the commandment. So, if you love God, you will keep his commandments, okay? And what God really wants is love, because we see a hierarchy that if you love God, you will keep his commandments. What God desires, obedience, is better than sacrifice. And so, being obedient is what he wants over the sacrifice. And if you love him, then you will be obedient. So, love is what he wants over obedience. So, overall, even a disobedient son, or a wayward son, or who's disobedient can be forgiven. These are the lessons that Jesus tries to teach about the prodigal son, and about the two sons in his parable. One who said he was going to do it, but didn't, and one who said he wasn't going to do it, but did do it. So, love is what we want, and love then makes one act on behalf of the one they love. So, if you love God, then you will keep his commandments. And so, anyone who takes you away from those commandments is a false prophet. Now, Jesus gives us ways to identify a false prophet as well. He says, you'll know them from their fruits. A good tree can't bear bad fruit, and a bad tree can't bear good fruits. He says that they also come to you as wolves in sheep's or lamb's clothing. Okay, that's two ways to identify that Jesus is giving. So, let's break this down. When we talk about a wolf, we have to look at the Bible's instances of the use of such a word. And so, when Jesus says that they are ravenous wolves, then that takes us back to Jacob's statement, and identifies the tribe of Benjamin, specifically, because Benjamin was simply called a ravenous wolf by Jacob. So, we'll look at the tribe of Benjamin for false prophets, and Paul comes as the person, of course, of interest. And when we look at Paul's doctrine, we see that he passed all the things that they said that a false prophet would do fit him. So, he has caused people to leave the commandments or the law, one of Moses' criterias. The second criteria is that he made assertions from God that did not come to pass, such as that everyone who was alive at the time with him would be taken up to heaven, and that the dead would not proceed the living into heaven. But yet, at his later stages of life, when his own death was imminent, he said that he was going to be with Jesus as the dead, and that to be absent from the body was to be with Christ. And so, not only did his initial statements not come to pass, but then he contradicted them, as well as lying several times, as he said, for Christ. And so, these don't seem like the actions of a man of God, let alone his background as a persecutor and a killer. And so, these don't fit the actions. Now, Jesus gave criteria, as well. So, we see his fruits, his actions. He's producing bad fruit. He's from the tribe of Benjamin, who have a history of rebellion. And so, when you talk about the rebellious ones, we're talking about the tribe of Benjamin. And so, the tree that he comes from produces bad fruit, continually. And so, Jesus asked, do men gather grapes from thorns, as another analogy for this. And so, Paul's doctrine is not a doctrine that would come from God. So, the final test of this is we look at Jesus' works, where Jesus heals the blind, continually. And specifically, he heals a man who gives a very poignant story, or understanding that, if you were in doubt of whether Jesus came from God, the fact that he restored a man's sight, or gave a man sight who'd never seen, told him that he was from God. In contrast, Paul blinds a man called Son of Jesus. Now, we know that Acts, the book of Acts, has labeled this man as a sorcerer, or a sinner. But Jesus healed sinners. He didn't blind them. And so, Paul tells this man that the hand of God is upon him. The right hand of God is a hand of judgment. So, Paul himself admits several times to be a figure of judgment, (Romans 9) where Jesus presents himself as a healer. So, Paul then blinds a man who is a spiritual man, because he doesn't like that the man is speaking against him. Jesus never did this. Jesus does the works of his Father. But Paul blinds a man. That is not the work of Jesus, and that is not the work of his Father, Jesus' Father, or our Father. So, blinding a man is an act of Satan. It is not an act of God. Healing is what Jesus did. So, this contrasts Paul and Jesus. And so, we see here that Paul emerges at this time when he blinds Elemas, blind Elemas, and wins the approval of the Romans. He does what Moses says, that this man did a sign. And he did wonders, and people believed him and went after another God. And so, we see Paul is a figure who fits all the criteria of a false prophet.
