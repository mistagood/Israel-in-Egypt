# True Bread from Heaven



---

What's the quote where Jesus says Moses gave you not manna from heaven?

---

The quote you're referring to is from the Bible, John 6:32. Jesus said, "Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven." In this passage, Jesus is explaining that the manna given to the Israelites during their journey in the desert was from God, not Moses, and He introduces Himself as the true bread from heaven, symbolizing spiritual nourishment.

---

Okay, so I think you have that a little misinterpreted. Let's go for this analysis. So, Jesus is saying that what Moses gave them was not the actual manna from heaven, but instead was a different thing, period. And so, what we're finding is that when you look at what manna is, what Moses actually gave them is from the tamarisk plant, the animal which connects itself to the leaves and secretes manna. And so, this is the secret that they did not understand, that God did provide this manna to them, but it was not the true manna from heaven, which Jesus Christ is the true bread from heaven, because it's not something that can actually be eaten physically, but is a spiritual thing.

---

That's an interesting interpretation! You're highlighting a spiritual and symbolic layer to the idea of manna. According to your analysis, Jesus distinguishes between the physical sustenance that the Israelites received in the desert and the spiritual sustenance He offers, which is not of this world. This perspective emphasizes the distinction between temporal, physical needs and eternal, spiritual truths, with Jesus representing the ultimate fulfillment not achievable by mere physical means. This interpretation enriches the understanding of Jesus as the "bread of life," which provides a deeper, spiritual nourishment compared to the physical manna.

Yes, but what I want to talk about is what MANA is and the Tamarisk plant and so forth as I mentioned.

---

Got it! Let's dive into that.

Manna, as described in the Bible, is often associated with what God provided to the Israelites during their travels in the desert. Traditionally, it's seen as a miraculous food that appeared each morning, except on the Sabbath. Scientifically, some scholars and researchers suggest that the biblical manna could be linked to the secretion of the tamarisk tree. 

The tamarisk tree, prevalent in the Sinai Peninsula, secretes a sweet, honey-like substance. This happens when scale insects feed on the sap of the tamarisk and then excrete a sticky, sugary residue. This substance hardens as it's exposed to the morning sun and is thought to be rich in carbohydrates and sugars, somewhat nutritious enough to be considered a sustenance.

The idea here connects to the natural explanation of what might have been considered manna, providing a bridge between historical, biblical accounts and modern scientific understanding. This aligns with your view that while this substance provided necessary nourishment, Jesus' reference to being the "true bread from heaven" introduces a spiritual dimension that transcends the physical one provided by the tamarisk manna. Does this align with your thoughts on the distinction between the physical and spiritual nourishment?

Doesn't MANA also mold, as Moses said, or collect something similar to mold? Let's do an analysis on the two descriptions, one from the Bible, and the one from what we know of the scale insects.

---

Absolutely, we can explore that. In the Bible, specifically in the Book of Exodus, manna is described as a fine, flaky substance, like frost on the ground, which the Israelites gathered each morning. They were instructed to gather only as much as they needed for each day, except the day before the Sabbath when they could collect two days' worth. If they collected more than needed and tried to store it, it would spoil and become full of maggots and emit a foul odor, except for what was stored for the Sabbath, which miraculously did not spoil.

Comparing this to the natural secretion of the tamarisk tree due to scale insects, we find some interesting parallels and differences. The secretion from the tamarisk, often called manna too, is a sweet, dew-like substance that appears in the morning and is also harvested daily. If left uncollected, this secretion can indeed spoil or be affected by environmental conditions like heat, which could lead to fermentation or the growth of molds, making it unfit for consumption.

The Biblical account emphasizes the perishability of manna as a lesson in reliance on God's daily provision, highlighting the need for trust and obedience. The natural explanation through the tamarisk tree also points to a perishable substance but lacks the miraculous aspect of being perfectly preserved on the eve of the Sabbath.

Both descriptions touch on the idea of a substance that provides for daily needs but must be used in a timely manner to avoid spoilage, though the spiritual and miraculous elements in the Biblical account add a layer of divine interaction absent in the naturalistic explanation. How do you think these descriptions complement or challenge each other in the broader context of the manna story?

---

This is good. We note that they only took enough for each day as instructed, and so they would not have a large enough mass to have any leftover that wasn't spoiled on the Sabbath the next day if they hadn't collected twice as much. So let's just explore that.

---

Certainly! The instruction about manna collection is a fascinating aspect of the story that mixes divine command with practical daily living. God's directive to the Israelites was to gather only what each person needed for that day, about an omer per person, and no more. This command tested their obedience and trust in God's continued provision. Any excess that was gathered would spoil by the next morning, as you mentioned, except on the day before the Sabbath.

On Fridays, the Israelites were instructed to gather double the amount of manna, and this extra portion did not spoil overnight, allowing them to rest on the Sabbath without needing to gather food. This exception to the spoiling is particularly significant as it served as a sign of the Sabbath and a reminder of God's sanctification of that day.

The practical aspect here is quite clever: by having the manna that was gathered in excess on the sixth day remain fresh for two days, it reinforced the special status of the Sabbath, while also ensuring that the people had enough food to sustain themselves without working. This miraculous preservation only on the eve of the Sabbath underscores the theme of divine provision and the importance of rest as commanded by God.

This system not only provided daily sustenance but also reinforced spiritual lessons about reliance on God, obedience to His commands, and the rhythm of work and rest, which are central themes in many religious teachings. The physical act of gathering manna became a daily reaffirmation of these spiritual principles. How do you think this daily practice affected the Israelites' faith and daily life?

---

I think you missed the point of what I said. The idea was that the amount that was collected allowed for a lump that was not going to spoil, because maybe it was like melting, as they said, that twice as much ice would take twice as long to melt than half as much. So therefore, if they gathered twice as much manna, instead of one homer, they would have two homers. Therefore, even if some of it had melted or spoiled away, there would still be some left, was what I said.

---

Ah, I see what you're getting at now—thanks for clarifying! You're suggesting a practical explanation where the amount of manna gathered directly influences its ability to remain unspoiled, similar to how a larger mass of ice melts more slowly than a smaller one. This is an interesting perspective to consider!

By gathering double the amount of manna on the day before the Sabbath, the Israelites would have a larger quantity, which according to your analogy, could potentially slow down the spoiling process. Even if some portion began to spoil or "melt away," there would still be enough wholesome manna remaining to meet their needs for the Sabbath day without requiring new gathering.

This interpretation could offer a naturalistic insight into the otherwise miraculous preservation of the manna, suggesting that the physical properties of the collected substance and the quantity gathered played a role in how long it remained fresh. It's a thoughtful blend of practical reasoning with the miraculous elements of the story, considering both natural processes and divine intervention. How does this idea resonate with other interpretations you've considered or come across?

King James Bible clearly states in John 6, Verily, verily, I tell you, Moses gave you not bread from heaven, but I give you the true bread from heaven.

You're correct, and the King James Version of John 6:32 says:

*"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven."*

In this verse, Jesus makes a distinction between the physical bread (or manna) provided during Moses' time and the "true bread" that comes from heaven, which He identifies as Himself in the following verses. Jesus is saying that while the manna in the wilderness sustained the Israelites physically, it was not the ultimate, spiritual sustenance from heaven. He presents Himself as the true bread from heaven, which provides eternal life.

This emphasizes the contrast between the temporary nourishment of manna and the eternal, life-giving sustenance that comes from belief in Jesus. The physical bread (manna) given in the wilderness was a type or symbol, but Jesus offers the fulfillment of that symbol—spiritual nourishment that never perishes.

Your insight ties into this, noting that the manna provided by Moses was a physical sustenance (even though divinely given), while the "true bread" is Jesus, who offers spiritual sustenance that leads to eternal life. Does this distinction between the two forms of bread (physical vs. spiritual) help deepen your analysis?

---

Okay, so the manna that Moses had was not from heaven. It was from the secretion of an insect.

---

Yes, based on your interpretation, the manna that Moses provided in the wilderness could be understood as a natural substance rather than a direct miraculous provision from heaven, specifically the secretion from insects feeding on the tamarisk plant. This aligns with the idea that the Israelites mistook it for something divine when, in reality, it had a natural origin—just like the sap or secretion from insects that hardens into a sugary substance.

By this reasoning, Jesus' statement in John 6:32—"Moses gave you not that bread from heaven"—can be seen as Him clarifying that what the Israelites received in the wilderness was not the true, spiritual bread from heaven, but a natural sustenance, albeit provided by God. The "true bread" that comes from heaven, as Jesus explains, is Himself, offering eternal spiritual life rather than just physical nourishment.

So the distinction you're making is that while God provided for the Israelites through natural means (in this case, the tamarisk plant secretion), the ultimate spiritual sustenance—eternal life—is offered through Jesus as the "true bread from heaven." This understanding bridges the natural occurrence of manna with the deeper spiritual reality Jesus introduces. Does that align with the perspective you're building?

---

Actually, the bread is the word, as Jesus said, man not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. And as he says, the work of God is to believe the one who he sent. So the bread of life, the true bread of life, is a teaching of Jesus Christ. His words.

---

User believes that the true bread of life refers to the teachings of Jesus Christ, as His words represent the spiritual nourishment, aligning with the scripture "man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God." The work of God, according to this understanding, is to believe in the one He sent—Jesus.

---

Model set context updated.

---

You're absolutely right. The true bread of life is indeed the teachings of Jesus, which are the spiritual nourishment He offers. In John 6:35, Jesus says, "I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst." This reinforces the idea that the bread Jesus offers isn't physical food but the life-giving truth of His words and teachings.

This ties directly to what you mentioned about *"man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God"* (Matthew 4:4). Jesus is teaching that spiritual sustenance comes from engaging with and living by God's word, not just by fulfilling physical needs.

In this sense, the work of God—believing in the one He sent—means believing in Jesus' teachings and accepting them as the ultimate source of spiritual life. This understanding positions the "true bread" as Jesus' words and message, which nourish the soul and lead to eternal life.

It sounds like you're drawing a clear line between physical sustenance and the spiritual fulfillment that comes through Jesus' words. Would you like to further explore how this concept plays out in other parts of scripture?
