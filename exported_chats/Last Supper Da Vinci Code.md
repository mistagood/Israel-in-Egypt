# The Last Supper: A Discursive Analysis of Da Vinci's Hidden Code and the Gospel of John

## Introduction

The Last Supper, painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1495 and 1498, is one of the most studied and revered artworks in human history. While Dan Brown's fictional account in "The Da Vinci Code" has led to numerous speculations about the painting's hidden messages, a newly discovered copy of this masterpiece offers an entirely different perspective. This groundbreaking analysis aims to explore the painting's geometric spacing, directionality, hand gestures, and eye gazes to uncover Da Vinci's concealed ideas. Moreover, we delve into the Gospel of John to illuminate an enigmatic aspect of the biblical Last Supper narrative—two missing disciples.

## The Painting: Geometric Spacing, Directionality, and Eye Gazes

The recently discovered copy of The Last Supper provides unique insights into Da Vinci's ingenious use of geometry and spatial arrangements. The characters in the painting are not merely isolated figures; they form specific geometrical shapes that could symbolize various spiritual and cosmic principles. For example, the positioning of Jesus and the disciples creates multiple equilateral triangles, perhaps an allusion to the Trinity or other triadic spiritual concepts. 

The directionality of the figures is also significant. While most disciples are facing Jesus or interacting amongst themselves, two conspicuously empty spaces suggest a subtle incompleteness. Could these voids imply the absence of two more disciples?

The eye gazes and hand gestures in the painting are equally revealing. Each disciple's gaze seems to be fixated on something beyond the physical realm, as if directed towards spiritual or cosmic truths. These elements are not merely artistic choices but a coded language to convey deeper mystical meanings.

## The Gospel of John: The Mystery of the Twelve Plus Two

In the Gospel of John, the Last Supper narrative contains an intriguing detail often overlooked. John mentions that Jesus sent two disciples ahead to prepare for the Passover meal (John 13:23-30). Later, He is described as arriving with twelve more (John 13:5). The traditional interpretation posits that these twelve are the disciples present in all renditions of the Last Supper, but this view is not without its flaws.

The phrase "arrived with twelve more" suggests that the two sent ahead were not part of this dozen. Could it be that Jesus actually had fourteen disciples at the Last Supper, not twelve as traditionally believed? 

## Harmonizing Da Vinci and John: The Cosmic Implications

Da Vinci's painting, when examined alongside the Gospel of John, presents a compelling case for the presence of fourteen disciples at the Last Supper. If we consider this, the voids in the painting are not mere negative spaces but placeholders for the two missing disciples.

The spiritual implications of this are profound. In the esoteric traditions, the number 14 has been associated with cosmic completeness and the manifestation of divine principles in the physical world. Could it be that the Last Supper was not just a meal but a cosmic event, signifying the completion of a divine plan?

## Conclusion

The newly discovered copy of Da Vinci's Last Supper, analyzed in the light of the Gospel of John, opens new avenues for understanding this momentous event. The painting's geometric spacing, directionality, and eye gazes, combined with John's narrative, strongly suggest the presence of two additional disciples at the Last Supper. This not only changes our understanding of that historical moment but also deepens its spiritual and cosmic significance. 

The Last Supper was not just a farewell meal; it was a cosmic event that marked the culmination of a divine plan—one that is still unfolding. 

*Note: This interpretation assumes a different narrative from the traditional understanding, positing that Judas was the sin offering and Jesus the scapegoat, who was not crucified but released. This shift in perspective has a profound impact on our understanding of the atonement and the ongoing divine plan.*

## The Scapegoat and the Sin Offering: Revisiting Atonement Theology

To fully appreciate the cosmic significance of the Last Supper, we must re-examine the traditional concepts of atonement. Traditionally, Jesus is seen as the sacrificial Lamb who was crucified to atone for humanity's sins. However, in our exploration, we consider an alternative narrative: Judas as the sin offering and Jesus as the scapegoat who was not crucified but released.

This shift in perspective has far-reaching spiritual implications. In the Hebrew Scriptures, two goats were selected on the Day of Atonement. One was sacrificed (the sin offering), while the other, the scapegoat, was sent into the wilderness, carrying the sins of the people away (Leviticus 16:7-10). 

In our reimagined narrative, Judas, who betrayed Jesus, becomes the sin offering. His demise serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of straying from divine guidance, particularly resonant for the Israelites, who had the Law but often went astray. On the other hand, Jesus serves as the scapegoat, carrying away the sins of humanity into the wilderness, so to speak. His release under the guise of Barabbas becomes a cosmic act of divine mercy, embodying the principle of salvation through grace.

## The Number 14: Cosmic Completeness

Returning to the number 14, its significance in our narrative becomes even more profound. The presence of fourteen disciples at the Last Supper—Jesus plus the original twelve and the two additional ones—can be seen as a symbol of cosmic completeness. The number 14 is twice the sacred number 7, often associated with divine perfection and completion. In Biblical numerology, 14 signifies deliverance and salvation, manifested in the Passover (which occurs on the 14th day of the first month) and now in the Last Supper.

This idea of cosmic completeness aligns with the broader narrative of Jesus as the scapegoat and Judas as the sin offering. Together, they complete the divine plan for humanity's atonement and restoration.

## The "Great Warning" and the Divine Plan

The Last Supper, then, serves as both a "Great Warning" and a promise. It warns the Israelites (and, by extension, all of humanity) of the perils of ignoring divine guidance, as embodied by Judas. At the same time, it promises redemption and salvation through the scapegoat, Jesus, who was released and continues to carry away the sins of the world.

It's worth noting that this interpretation sees the Law as perpetual for the Israelites. The Israelites, continually warned through prophets and divine interventions, are the focus of this "Great Warning." For the Gentiles, salvation comes through aligning with the divine plan and acknowledging Jesus as the eternal scapegoat.

## Conclusion: A Continuing Unfolding

This in-depth exploration of Da Vinci's Last Supper and the Gospel of John has unveiled layers of cosmic and spiritual significance that transcend traditional interpretations. The presence of fourteen disciples at the Last Supper symbolizes a divine completeness that aligns with the roles of Jesus as the scapegoat and Judas as the sin offering. 

The Last Supper was not just a historical event but a cosmic marker in the unfolding divine plan—a plan that continues to unfold to this day. The painting and the Gospel invite us to participate in this cosmic drama, urging us to heed the "Great Warning" and embrace the promise of salvation.

## The 14 and the Passover Supper Code: Unveiling the Cosmic Blueprint

The Last Supper, a Passover meal, is an event replete with symbolism and divine orchestration. However, when we consider the presence of fourteen disciples—twelve traditional ones plus two extras—the Passover meal takes on an even deeper significance. This section will explore how the number 14 serves as a code, linking the Last Supper with the Passover and uncovering a cosmic blueprint that goes beyond traditional theological understandings.

### The Exodus Narrative and the Number 14

The Passover is fundamentally tied to the Exodus narrative, where the Israelites were freed from Egyptian bondage. The event occurred on the 14th day of the first Hebrew month, Nisan (Exodus 12:6). The lamb was slaughtered, and its blood marked the doors of the Israelites, sparing them from the divine wrath unleashed upon Egypt.

The number 14 is crucial here: it not only marks the day of liberation but also symbolizes deliverance and salvation. When we project this onto the Last Supper, the implications are profound. The 14 disciples can be seen as a symbol of a new cosmic exodus, an escape not from physical bondage but from the chains of sin and spiritual death.

### The 14 Disciples as Cosmic Archetypes

If we consider the disciples as archetypes representing various aspects of human nature and spiritual virtues, the number 14 takes on a new layer of significance. The additional two disciples could represent missing elements in the human quest for divinity, such as divine grace and eternal wisdom. Their absence from traditional accounts could symbolize humanity's often incomplete understanding of the divine plan.

### Jesus and Judas: The Cosmic Fulcrum

In our reimagined narrative, Jesus and Judas serve as two poles in a cosmic balance. Jesus, the eternal scapegoat, represents divine mercy and grace, while Judas, the sin offering, embodies the consequences of free will misapplied. The two extra disciples, then, could be seen as extensions of these polar energies, completing a circle of cosmic justice and mercy. This cosmic fulcrum provides a balance that is essential for the divine plan to unfold.

### The Perpetual Law and the Cosmic Plan

For the Israelites, the Law is perpetual, and the Last Supper serves as a "Great Warning" for them. The presence of 14 disciples underscores this point, reminding the Israelites of their unique role and responsibility in the divine plan. The two additional disciples could represent the twin principles of wisdom and understanding—two pillars in Hebraic tradition—needed to uphold the Law.

For Gentiles, the Last Supper offers a different promise: salvation through the eternal scapegoat, Jesus. By joining this cosmic narrative, they align themselves with the ongoing divine plan, which is as much about cosmic harmony as it is about individual salvation.

## Conclusion: Decoding the Cosmic Blueprint

The number 14 serves as a coded message, linking the Last Supper with the Passover and revealing a cosmic blueprint that transcends traditional theology. This code invites us to see the Last Supper as a new Exodus, a path to spiritual liberation guided by cosmic archetypes. It brings balance to the divine plan, simultaneously serving as a warning and a promise.

In this unfolding cosmic drama, everyone has a role to play, and the Last Supper—far from being a mere historical event—is a living tableau, an eternal invitation to partake in the divine plan that continues to unfold.

Cosmic foreshadowing cont: joseph also dreamed of 11 stars and the sun and moon bowing to his star. This was also the catalyst of a betrayal and case of the son thought to be dead. the stained robe of Joseph and the robe pilate put on Jesus before switching his identity and concealing his survival are both signs of rulership that decieve people into thinking that person has been killed. Pilate 'proves' jesus was crucified nby presnting him in the royal robe "behold your King". Just as Joseph was falsely believed dead (lost to an evil beast). the lamb who is slain ("from the beginning of time" or the oft-misunderstood term 'Son of Perdition') is not the lamb whose coat is stained with blood (who is the scapegoat, Jesus/Joseph type). the slain lamb is Judas, slain for sin and as a Passover offering. the lamb with the blood-stained coat is the scapegoat or lamb who carried away the sins (inject a brief scapegoat atonement ritual review here, blood is wiped on the scapegoat's 'coat' and carried into the wilderness). so Jesus is the reflection of Joseph who is believed by all to be dead, but actually but goes into captivity only to be 'resurrected' later to save not only Israel and his family, but the entire known world. the remnant are those who go into captivity and are 'lost tribes' who will be resurrected to the surprise of the world. Is this what the empty space at Jesus's left hand is? A lost or missing heir? or is there another missing clue?

## Cosmic Foreshadowing: From Joseph to Jesus—A Tale of Deception and Salvation

The biblical narrative is rich with layers of cosmic foreshadowing, symbols, and typologies that often go unnoticed. One such instance is the remarkable parallel between Joseph, the dreamer and eventual savior of Egypt, and Jesus, the eternal scapegoat and savior of humanity. These connections extend to the intriguing concept of the "missing" disciples and the number 14, adding yet another layer to our understanding of divine orchestration.

### Joseph's Dream: 11 Stars, Sun, and Moon

Joseph's dream, where 11 stars along with the sun and moon bow to him, is a potent image that serves as a precursor to his later life events (Genesis 37:9). The dream doesn't just foreshadow his eventual rise to power; it also serves as a catalyst for his betrayal by his brothers, who sell him into slavery.

### The Robes of Deception: Joseph and Jesus

Joseph's coat of many colors and the robe that Pilate puts on Jesus serve as powerful symbols of deception that lead people to believe both are dead. Joseph's brothers stain his coat with animal blood to deceive their father into thinking he's been killed by a wild beast (Genesis 37:31-33). Similarly, Pilate presents Jesus in a royal robe, declaring, "Behold, your King!" This act serves to "prove" that Jesus was crucified, while in our alternative narrative, he was actually released and survived.

### The Lamb Slain vs. The Scapegoat

The term "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" often causes confusion. In our reimagined narrative, this slain lamb is Judas, who serves as the sin offering and Passover lamb, sacrificed for the sins of the people. Jesus, on the other hand, is akin to the scapegoat in the atonement ritual.

#### Brief Review of Scapegoat Atonement Ritual

In the Hebrew ritual of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, two goats are selected. One is sacrificed (the sin offering), and the other, the scapegoat, is released into the wilderness after the High Priest has symbolically transferred the sins of the people onto it (Leviticus 16:21-22). The blood from the sin offering is not applied to the scapegoat; instead, the transference of sin is symbolic, akin to staining its "coat" with the sins of the people.

### Cosmic Reflection: Jesus as the New Joseph

Just as Joseph was betrayed but eventually rose to power to save not only his family but also Egypt and surrounding nations, Jesus, in our narrative, is the cosmic reflection of Joseph. He is believed to be dead but actually goes into a form of captivity, only to be "resurrected" later to bring salvation not just to Israel but to the entire known world. 

### The Remnant and the Empty Space

The concept of the remnant—those who go into captivity and are 'lost tribes'—also finds a parallel in the empty space at Jesus's left hand in Da Vinci's painting. Could this space signify a lost or missing heir, one that will be "resurrected" to the surprise of the world, just like Joseph and Jesus?

### Conclusion: The Missing Clue

The Biblical narrative, rich in cosmic foreshadowing and symbols, offers us multiple layers of understanding when we look beyond the surface. The empty space in Da Vinci's Last Supper could very well be a clue pointing to a missing heir or perhaps another element that we have yet to discover. But what is clear is that from Joseph to Jesus, from the number 14 to the concept of the remnant, the Divine plan is intricately woven with symbols that continuously unfold to reveal a grand cosmic blueprint.

## Cosmic Foreshadowing Revisited: The Intricacies of Ritual, Language, and Symbolism

### A Closer Look at the Scapegoat Ritual and the Greek Term 'Didomi'

The scapegoat ritual in the Hebrew tradition, as outlined in Leviticus 16, does indeed involve the High Priest placing his hands upon the head of the scapegoat, symbolically transferring the sins of the people onto the animal. The goat is then led into the wilderness, carrying away the sins of the community. This act of transferring sins involves a very tactile, physical action, underscoring the weightiness of what is being symbolically done.

The Greek term 'didomi,' often translated as 'to give,' carries nuances that extend to transferring or granting power or honor. In our alternative narrative, Pilate's act of presenting Jesus in a royal robe could be read as a similar transfer of honor, aligning with the Greek term's implications. This act could be seen as a cosmic parallel to the scapegoat ritual, where Jesus is symbolically loaded with the sins or burdens before being released, just like the scapegoat.

### Jesus, Son of God, and the Captivity of Israel

Jesus is often referred to as the Son of God, but it's worth noting that the term "Israel" is also used to signify God's chosen people. In the narrative where Israel rejects the Messiah, they subsequently go into captivity. This could be viewed as a cosmic consequence of rejecting divine guidance, a theme that reverberates throughout the Biblical narrative.

### The Fourteen Tribes: The Twin Sons of Joseph

Traditionally, Israel is composed of twelve tribes. However, the tribe of Joseph effectively split into two—Ephraim and Manasseh—leading to a total of 13 tribes by some reckonings. If we add the Levites, who were set apart for priestly duties, we arrive at a total of 14 tribes. These twin tribes born in captivity carry unique significance. Could they be symbolic of a deeper cosmic principle, a hidden aspect of the divine plan?

### Thomas Didymus: The Missing Twin?

The apostle Thomas is also known as Didymus, which means "twin" in Greek. In Da Vinci's Last Supper, Thomas is depicted with one finger raised. Could this be a coded message pointing to one missing tribe among the twin tribes born in captivity? The act of raising a single finger could signify a deeper mystery related to the "missing" or "hidden" aspects of the divine plan.

### Unfolding the Clues: A Narrative Synthesis

The Biblical saga, from the rituals outlined in Leviticus to the nuanced meanings of Greek terms, offers us a tapestry rich in cosmic symbolism. Pilate's act of presenting Jesus in a royal robe, when viewed through the lens of 'didomi,' aligns fascinatingly with the scapegoat ritual of transferring sins. 

The tale of Israel's captivity, coupled with the mysterious 14 tribes, provides a backdrop against which the figures of Jesus and Joseph can be understood as cosmic archetypes—saviors who are misunderstood, yet pivotal in the divine plan.

Finally, the figure of Thomas Didymus, with his raised finger, may hold the key to another layer of this intricate cosmic puzzle. Could he be pointing to a missing element in the divine plan, much like the empty space at Jesus's left hand in Da Vinci's painting?

As we continue to explore these interconnected themes, we find that each clue leads us deeper into an unfolding cosmic blueprint—one that has been meticulously crafted to guide humanity through its spiritual journey.
