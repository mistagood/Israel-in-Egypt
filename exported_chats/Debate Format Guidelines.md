# Debate Format Guidelines



---



---

If I wanted to do some debates and debate people on some of these topics that I talk about and maybe make it into a format, which I'm not asking you to do right now, that's not the subject at all, or that's not the task that I want from you, what I want from you is to know what would the rules of debate look like, and what's the point, because I would want to keep it in some parameters as I'm thinking about it. I'm just thinking about this, so I just want to think about what it would look like and, you know, kind of what are the goals and rules that would help to contain and keep everything within the parameters of what a debate is for, as opposed to, I think, help people lay out opinions, different sides to an argument, and to allow the public to hear that, and so there's order, and there has to be some kind of way of of judging the rhetorical arguments, so that's what I'm looking for, those kinds of rules. I wasn't on the debate team, unfortunately, or else I would know this.

To think about launching a **structured debate format** around the themes you're exploring—especially theological, historical, and identity-related topics—it’s wise to begin with the **purpose** and then define the **rules and judging framework** that keep it fair, focused, and productive. Here's a breakdown of how this might look:

---

## 📌 PURPOSE OF DEBATE

1. **Clarify Competing Interpretations**  
   To bring forward different viewpoints on biblical, historical, or cultural topics, allowing audiences to hear well-reasoned positions.

2. **Restore Order to Controversial Discourse**  
   Provide a controlled forum for discussing ideas that are typically suppressed, misrepresented, or scattered.

3. **Educate, Not Just Entertain**  
   Debates should illuminate the text or history in question, not just be verbal combat. Clarity and evidence win, not theatrics.

4. **Create a Historical Record**  
   Debates contribute to a public archive of competing views, helping researchers, students, and the public see where lines of disagreement lie.

## ⚖️ BASIC STRUCTURE & TIMING (Modified Lincoln-Douglas or Oxford Style)

| **Phase**                      | **Time**    | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Opening Statements            | 5 mins each | Frame the issue, introduce key terms, and lay out the thesis.              |
| Rebuttals                     | 4 mins each | Respond directly to the opponent's core arguments.                         |
| Cross-examination (moderated)| 8 mins total (4 each) | Ask direct questions; may be guided by moderator.                 |
| Evidence Round (optional)     | 5 mins each | Present scripture, quotes, or source texts as primary evidence.            |
| Final Closing Arguments       | 3 mins each | Restate central claim; show why your position best explains the facts.     |

## 📜 FORMAT RULES

### 1. **Topic Must Be a Statement, Not a Question**
   - Example: *“Paul is the false prophet warned about in Deuteronomy 13.”*
   - Both sides take either **affirmative** or **negative** stance.

### 2. **Use of Sources**
   - Must cite directly: chapter and verse for scripture, or title/date for history.
   - No paraphrasing without clear sourcing.

### 3. **Definition of Terms**
   - Both sides must agree to definitions before debate begins (e.g., “false prophet,” “Ephraimite,” “atonement”).

### 4. **On-topic Only**
   - No appeals to emotion, ad hominem, or unrelated doctrines.
   - Stick to the proposition, no introducing wild tangents.

### 5. **One Interruption Rule (Optional)**
   - Each side allowed **1 interjection** per round (used wisely).

## 🎯 JUDGING CRITERIA

You can have judges or let the audience vote using these criteria:

| **Criteria**           | **Weight** | **Notes** |
|------------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Clarity of Argument**| 30%        | Was the argument clearly stated and easy to follow? |
| **Use of Evidence**    | 25%        | Did they support claims with real scripture/historical facts? |
| **Responsiveness**     | 20%        | Did they actually answer their opponent or dodge? |
| **Consistency**        | 15%        | Did their theology/historical narrative stay internally consistent? |
| **Persuasiveness**     | 10%        | Did they move the audience to reconsider their position? |

---

## 🧱 MODERATION

A **moderator's job** is to:

- Keep time
- Enforce rules (e.g., no interruptions, off-topic digressions)
- Prompt clarification if terms are not defined
- Maintain neutrality

---

## 🛠 POSSIBLE FORMATS FOR DIFFERENT STYLES

- **Solo Rhetorical Challenge**: You present a thesis with a pre-recorded counterpoint inserted and then refuted by you.
- **Live Panel Style**: 2 vs. 2 with strict moderation, ideal for complex doctrines like resurrection or tribal identity.
- **Scripted Point-Counterpoint**: Written ahead of time and read aloud with visual citations.
- **Cross-Seminar Format**: You teach; opponent teaches; then moderated debate follows, blending seminar and debate.

---

Let me know when you're ready and I can help draft a debate charter, scoring sheets, or prep outline for a specific topic (e.g., Paul as false prophet vs. Moses as lawgiver).

---

Okay, thanks for that structure. What I'm looking for is more the rules, you know. I'm not asking you to help me format my thing. I'll think about that when I'm ready to. What I'm looking for is a general set of rules that I can understand what the debate does and what its purpose. I wasn't asking you to define my purpose or anything. I'm asking for general information, not specific to my case. I'm looking for information and rules, format structures, purpose, and all of those things about debating.

---

Absolutely. Here's a comprehensive, **general-purpose guide** to **debate structure, goals, and rules**, as practiced across formal and informal traditions such as academic, parliamentary, and public debates. This is not customized to your topics—it's an informational summary of how debates are generally defined, conducted, and judged.

# 🏛️ What Is a Debate?

A **debate** is a structured form of argumentation where two or more parties discuss opposing viewpoints on a clearly defined topic, called a **resolution** or **motion**. The goal is not necessarily to "win" by force of personality, but to **present reasoned, evidence-based arguments** while **respecting a system of rules**.

---

# 🎯 General Purpose of Debate

1. **Clarification of Ideas**  
   To distinguish and examine competing interpretations or positions on a subject.

2. **Critical Thinking**  
   Forces participants to anticipate counter-arguments, refine logic, and build coherence.

3. **Public Discourse & Education**  
   Allows observers to engage with complex topics through structured exchange.

4. **Rhetorical Skill-Building**  
   Trains speakers in persuasion, clarity, and use of language.

# 📜 Core Components of a Debate

| Term                 | Definition |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Resolution / Motion** | The proposition being debated (e.g., "X is true") |
| **Affirmative (Pro)** | The side that supports the resolution |
| **Negative (Con)**    | The side that opposes the resolution |
| **Rebuttal**          | A direct response to the opposing side’s argument |
| **Cross-examination**| Direct questioning of the opponent’s claims |
| **Judge / Moderator**| Enforces rules, evaluates arguments, and maintains order |

---

# 🧱 General Structure (Format-Agnostic)

1. **Opening Statements** (each side presents their case)
2. **Rebuttals** (direct response to opponent’s arguments)
3. **Cross-Examination / Questions**
4. **Closing Statements** (summary and final persuasive appeal)

---

# 🕰 Common Formats and Time Allotments

| Format               | Notable For | Structure |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Lincoln-Douglas** (1v1) | Ethics, philosophy, values | 1 Affirmative case → 1 Negative case → Rebuttals → Closing |
| **Parliamentary**    | Quick, witty, team-based | Teams (Gov vs. Opp), timed speeches, points of information |
| **Oxford / Public Forum** | Formal, public-friendly | Alternating timed speeches and summaries |
| **Policy Debate**    | Research-heavy, technical | Teams, emphasis on evidence, policy implications |

*Time varies by format: speeches range from 4 to 10 minutes; full debates typically 30–90 minutes.*

---

# ⚖️ Universal Rules of Debate

These rules apply across virtually all formal and informal debates:

### 1. **Clash**
   - Each side must directly **engage with the opposing arguments**. Ignoring counterpoints weakens credibility.

### 2. **Burden of Proof**
   - The **affirmative** side must prove the resolution.
   - The **negative** must show flaws in that proof or offer a better alternative.

### 3. **No Fallacies**
   - Avoid:
     - **Ad hominem** (attacking the person)
     - **Straw man** (misrepresenting the argument)
     - **Appeal to emotion** without evidence
     - **Non sequitur** (logic gaps)

### 4. **Respect Speaking Order**
   - Only speak during your allotted time or with permission (e.g., "point of information").

### 5. **No New Arguments in Closing**
   - Final speeches may summarize but **cannot introduce new claims**.

### 6. **Cite Evidence Clearly**
   - Use verifiable sources, scripture, or logic. Clearly indicate when quoting.

### 7. **Stay On Topic**
   - Arguments must stay relevant to the resolution and not drift.

# 🧠 Judging Criteria (Standard)

Judges or audiences often evaluate debaters on these core dimensions:

| Category             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Logic & Structure** | Clear flow of argument; no contradictions |
| **Evidence & Support**| Use of sources, texts, data, citations |
| **Responsiveness**    | Addressing opponent’s points directly |
| **Delivery**          | Clarity, tone, pacing—not volume or aggression |
| **Persuasiveness**    | Did the speaker actually persuade? |

---

# 🎓 Best Practices

- **Define key terms early**
- **Anticipate counterarguments**
- **Keep emotions in check**
- **Speak to persuade, not just to inform**
- **Practice “steel-manning”**: represent the opponent’s view as strongly as possible before responding

---

# 🛑 Disqualifying Violations (Typically)

- Personal insults or attacks
- Intentionally misrepresenting opponent's position
- Disruption of opponent’s time
- Falsification of sources or data
