# Prophet vs Dreamer



---

What is the Biblical definition of a prophet? I've read in footnotes and the Bible that there was a difference between a prophet or one who tells by dreams and that this was referring to I believe when Moses says if a prophet or one who has visions or tells by dreams that if what they say comes to pass then even if it comes to pass you shouldn't follow them if they go and say let us worship other gods. Now in the footnotes I believe in the New English translation they talk about the difference of what a prophet was traditionally versus one who has visions or foretells by dreams.

The biblical definition of a **prophet** is a person chosen by God to speak on His behalf, conveying divine messages, warnings, or guidance to individuals, nations, or the people of Israel. The Hebrew word for prophet, **navi' (נָבִיא)**, comes from a root meaning “to call” or “to proclaim.” Prophets were seen as intermediaries between God and humanity, delivering **revelation** that could be instructional, corrective, or predictive.

### **Distinction Between Prophets and Dreamers**
You are referring to **Deuteronomy 13:1-3**, where Moses warns about false prophets:

> _“If a prophet or one who foretells by dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us follow other gods’—gods that you have not known—‘and let us worship them,’ you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer of dreams. For the LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.”_  
(Deuteronomy 13:1-3)

Here, Moses distinguishes between:
1. **A Prophet** (נָבִיא, _navi’_): A messenger of God, traditionally chosen to speak His word.
2. **A Dreamer of Dreams** (חֹלֵם חֲלוֹם, _ḥolem ḥalom_): Someone who receives visions or dreams that may foretell the future.

Both could provide **signs or wonders** that come to pass, yet they were to be tested by whether their message aligned with the covenant with **YHWH (Yahweh)**. Even if their prediction came true, if they encouraged idolatry, they were considered **false prophets**.

### **Key Biblical Tests for a True Prophet**
Several passages establish criteria for discerning true prophets:

1. **Alignment with God’s Law & Worship**  
   - **Deuteronomy 13:5**: Even if their predictions come true, a prophet leading people away from God is false.
   - True prophets uphold the covenant and do not promote other gods.

2. **Accuracy in Foretelling Events**  
   - **Deuteronomy 18:21-22**:  
     > _“You may say in your heart, ‘How can we recognize a message that the LORD has not spoken?’ When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, and the message does not come to pass or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken.”_  
   - A prophet who speaks in God’s name but whose words fail to come true is false.

3. **The Spirit of the Prophet**  
   - **Jeremiah 23:16-18**: False prophets speak from their own minds and lead people astray.
   - **Numbers 12:6**: God speaks to true prophets through **visions and dreams**, but uniquely to Moses “face to face.”

4. **Moral and Ethical Character**  
   - **Micah 3:5-7** and **Jeremiah 23:9-40** condemn false prophets who speak for profit, lead people into sin, or declare peace when destruction is near.

### **The Role of Dreams & Visions**
- **Dreams were a legitimate way God communicated** (Genesis 37:5-10; Daniel 7:1). However, dreams alone were not the primary mark of a prophet.
- **Numbers 12:6** distinguishes that God makes Himself known to prophets in visions and dreams.
- **Jeremiah 23:25-28** criticizes false prophets who rely on dreams but do not speak God’s truth.
- **Acts 2:17** (quoting Joel 2:28) prophesies that in the last days, God will pour out His Spirit, and people will have visions and dreams.

### **Traditional vs. Visionary Prophets**
The **New English Translation (NET) footnotes** likely discuss a distinction found in biblical texts:
- Some prophets were **orators**, delivering messages in direct speech from God.
- Others were **visionaries or dreamers**, who received symbolic imagery requiring interpretation.

Both types existed, but what mattered was whether their revelation aligned with **God’s covenant**.

### **Conclusion**
A **prophet** is more than someone who predicts the future; they are a **covenantal messenger** of God. The Bible warns that even miracle-working or dream-receiving individuals must be tested against **faithfulness to God**. The distinction in Deuteronomy 13 suggests that while **prophets and dreamers could both foretell events, only those loyal to YHWH’s law were true prophets**.

So by those standards, is Paul a true prophet or a false prophet?

---

By the biblical standards for testing a prophet, Paul’s status is highly questionable. Let's apply the scriptural criteria to his teachings and actions:

---

### **1. Does Paul Lead People to Worship Other Gods? (Deuteronomy 13:1-3)**
Moses warns that even if a prophet performs signs or wonders, if they encourage worshiping a different god, they are false.  

- **Paul introduces a version of Jesus that is distinct from the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament.**
  - The Hebrew Scriptures describe a Messiah who upholds the Law and restores Israel.
  - Paul presents Jesus as a **divine figure** whose **death and resurrection** replace the Law (Romans 10:4, Galatians 3:10-13).
  - Paul’s doctrine **shifts worship away from the God of Israel to a crucified figure** (1 Corinthians 2:2).
  - The **Jesus of Paul** demands faith in the cross rather than obedience to the covenant.

✅ **Fails the test.** Paul leads people to a different theological construct than the Torah-based worship of YHWH.

---

### **2. Are Paul’s Predictions Accurate? (Deuteronomy 18:21-22)**
A true prophet’s words **must come to pass** exactly as stated.

- **Paul predicted that Jesus would return within his lifetime.**  
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17: _“We who are alive and remain will be caught up …”_
  - 1 Corinthians 7:29-31: _“The time is short … the present form of this world is passing away.”_
  - Romans 13:11-12: _“Salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.”_

- **Jesus did not return in Paul’s lifetime.**  
  - Paul clearly expected the imminent return of Christ.
  - This did not happen.
  - False prophets are exposed when their words **do not come to pass**.

✅ **Fails the test.** Paul’s major prediction about Jesus’ return was incorrect.

---

### **3. Does Paul Align with God’s Law? (Deuteronomy 13, Isaiah 8:20)**
Moses states that **a prophet must uphold God’s commandments.**

- **Paul teaches that the Law is abolished.**
  - Romans 6:14: _“You are not under the Law, but under grace.”_
  - Galatians 2:16: _“A person is not justified by works of the Law.”_
  - Ephesians 2:15: _“By abolishing the Law of commandments.”_

- **Yet, Jesus and the Hebrew prophets upheld the Law.**
  - Matthew 5:17-19: _“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law … not one jot or tittle will pass away.”_
  - Malachi 4:4: _“Remember the Law of Moses, my servant.”_

✅ **Fails the test.** Paul explicitly contradicts Torah by nullifying the Law.

---

### **4. What Is the Spirit Behind Paul? (Jeremiah 23:16-18)**
- **Paul claims special visions and revelations.**
  - Galatians 1:12: _“I did not receive [the gospel] from any man … but by revelation from Jesus Christ.”_
  - 2 Corinthians 12:2-4: _“I know a man in Christ who was caught up to the third heaven … and heard things that cannot be told.”_

- **Yet, Jeremiah 23 warns against prophets who claim secret visions without aligning with God's commands.**
  - Jeremiah 23:25-27: _“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ … by their dreams they lead my people astray.”_

✅ **Fails the test.** Paul’s authority is based on **personal visions,** not verification by the existing prophetic tradition.

---

### **5. Was Paul a Ravenous Wolf? (Matthew 7:15-16)**
- **Jesus warned of “ravenous wolves” in sheep’s clothing.**
  - Matthew 7:15-16: _“By their fruits you will recognize them.”_

- **Paul was a self-admitted persecutor of the followers of Jesus before his conversion.**
  - Acts 9:1: _“Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples.”_
  - Philippians 3:6: _“As for zeal, persecuting the church.”_

- **Paul aligns with Jacob’s prophecy about Benjamin.**
  - Genesis 49:27: _“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the spoil.”_
  - Paul was from the tribe of **Benjamin** (Romans 11:1, Philippians 3:5).
  - He persecuted Jesus’ followers early on (devouring the prey).
  - Then he later divided Jesus’ teachings into a **new doctrine of grace, faith alone, and the abolition of the Law** (dividing the spoil).

✅ **Fails the test.** Paul fits the description of a **ravenous wolf** who caused division.

---

### **Final Assessment: False Prophet**
By **biblical standards**, Paul **fails every major test of a true prophet**:

1. **Leads people to a different version of God** (Deuteronomy 13:1-3).  
2. **False predictions** about Jesus’ return (Deuteronomy 18:21-22).  
3. **Contradicts God’s Law** by saying it is abolished (Isaiah 8:20).  
4. **Relies on personal visions and secret revelations** (Jeremiah 23).  
5. **Matches the description of a ravenous wolf** (Matthew 7:15-16).  

Paul’s teachings form the foundation of modern Christianity, but **his doctrine is different from what Jesus and Moses taught.** His message shifts focus from **obedience to God’s Law** to **faith in the crucifixion and grace alone.**  

Thus, **by the Torah’s standard, Paul is a false prophet.**
