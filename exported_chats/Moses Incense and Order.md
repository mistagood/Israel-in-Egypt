The ingredients for the incense prescribed to Moses are found in **Exodus 30:34-38**, where God instructs Moses to make sacred incense using the following ingredients:

1. **Stacte (or Gum Resin)** - likely a form of myrrh, used in its natural gum or resin form.
2. **Onycha** - an aromatic substance derived from the shell of a sea mollusk.
3. **Galbanum** - a gum resin obtained from certain Persian plants.
4. **Pure Frankincense** - a resin obtained from the Boswellia tree.

These ingredients were to be blended in equal amounts and ground into a fine powder, then placed in front of the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle.

### Where to Order Ingredients:
1. **Stacte/Gum Resin**: Myrrh can be ordered from suppliers like Amazon, Etsy, or specialized religious or natural goods stores.
2. **Onycha**: It may be more difficult to find, but some incense suppliers, religious artifact stores, or specialized herbal shops carry it.
3. **Galbanum**: Available from online fragrance or essential oil suppliers like Eden Botanicals, Mountain Rose Herbs, or Amazon.
4. **Frankincense**: Widely available from incense shops, herbal stores, or online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or specialty shops.

Make sure to look for pure, high-quality versions of these ingredients for any religious or ceremonial use.

I thought cannabis was one of the

The idea that **cannabis** might have been one of the ingredients in Moses' incense is a theory proposed by some scholars, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible. This theory is based on the interpretation of the Hebrew word **"qaneh-bosm"** (קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם), which appears in **Exodus 30:23** in the instructions for making the holy anointing oil, not incense. Some researchers believe that **"qaneh-bosm"** could be a reference to **cannabis**, due to its phonetic similarity to the modern term.

However, traditional translations of the Bible usually interpret **"qaneh-bosm"** as **calamus**, a reed plant that produces an aromatic oil. The more conventional understanding, particularly in Jewish and Christian traditions, has long held that **calamus** (a fragrant reed) was the intended plant, though some modern interpretations argue in favor of cannabis.

To summarize:

- The incense ingredients explicitly listed in **Exodus 30:34** do not include cannabis.
- The theory that **cannabis** was used as part of the holy anointing oil (not incense) is a modern interpretation of the word **qaneh-bosm**.

If you're interested in the scholarly debate, you may want to look into works on the subject that delve into the linguistic and historical arguments.

Okay, well what's the ingredients of the oil and where can I order them?

The holy anointing oil mentioned in **Exodus 30:22-25** consists of the following ingredients:

1. **Pure Myrrh** - 500 shekels (about 12.5 pounds or 5.7 kilograms)
2. **Sweet Cinnamon** - 250 shekels (about 6.25 pounds or 2.85 kilograms)
3. **Sweet Calamus** (sometimes interpreted as "qaneh-bosm," which some suggest could be cannabis) - 250 shekels (about 6.25 pounds or 2.85 kilograms)
4. **Cassia** - 500 shekels (about 12.5 pounds or 5.7 kilograms)
5. **Olive Oil** - 1 hin (about 1 gallon or 3.8 liters)

These ingredients were mixed together to create the holy anointing oil, which was used to anoint the tabernacle, its furnishings, and the priests.

### Where to Order Ingredients:
1. **Myrrh**: You can find pure myrrh resin or essential oil from Amazon, Mountain Rose Herbs, or specialized herbal shops.
   
2. **Cinnamon**: Sweet cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum, or "true cinnamon") can be found in grocery stores or purchased online from spice vendors, Amazon, or organic stores like Mountain Rose Herbs.
   
3. **Calamus** (or **Qaneh-bosm**): Traditional calamus can be sourced from herbal suppliers or specialty incense shops. For those who interpret **qaneh-bosm** as cannabis, this would require sourcing cannabis oil, which is legal in some areas for medicinal or recreational use, depending on the region.
   
4. **Cassia**: Cassia is a spice similar to cinnamon and is available from Amazon, spice shops, or herbal suppliers.

5. **Olive Oil**: High-quality extra virgin olive oil can be found in most grocery stores, or you can purchase it online from various sources such as Amazon, Costco, or any specialty food retailer.

For ceremonial use, it's essential to source pure and high-quality ingredients, especially if you plan to use the oil for religious or traditional purposes.
