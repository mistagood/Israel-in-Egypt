# Doomsday Book hierarchy



---



---

Are you familiar with the Doomsday book and the hierarchy that was set forth at the time that ordered the people from the king, the abbeys and the priests or whomever they were, the border slaves, etc.? What was that hierarchy? Let's get a... let's start a segment on this. Let's start a research file.

{"name": "doomsday_hierarchy", "type": "document", "content": "**Title: The Domesday Book and Feudal Hierarchy in 11th-Century England**\n\n**I. Introduction**\nThe Domesday Book, commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085 and completed in 1086, was a monumental survey of landholding and resources in England. Beyond its purpose as a tax assessment tool, the Domesday Book reveals the social and political structure of Norman England and the feudal hierarchy enforced by the Crown.\n\n**II. Purpose of the Domesday Book**\n- To record the value, ownership, and resources of all land holdings\n- To determine taxes and military obligations owed to the Crown\n- To settle disputes over land ownership post-Conquest\n\n**III. General Structure of Feudal Society in the Domesday Book**\nThe Domesday Book reflects a rigid feudal system imposed by the Normans. The hierarchy detailed in the Book can be outlined as follows:\n\n**1. The King**\n- Supreme landowner of all England\n- Granted land to tenants-in-chief in exchange for military service and loyalty\n\n**2. Tenants-in-Chief**\n- Usually Norman nobles, bishops, and abbots\n- Held land directly from the king\n- Responsible for supplying knights and soldiers to the Crown\n\n**3. Under-Tenants (Mesne Lords)**\n- Sublet lands from tenants-in-chief\n- May have held multiple manors\n- Collected rents and services from peasants\n\n**4. Knights and Minor Lords**\n- Often served as military retainers\n- Held smaller parcels of land in exchange for service\n- Sometimes directly held land from tenants-in-chief or under-tenants\n\n**5. Freemen (Sokemen, Bordars)**\n- Had more rights and mobility than villeins or serfs\n- Could own or rent small plots of land\n- Paid rents or services, but were not entirely bound to the land\n\n**6. Villeins (Villani)**\n- Largest class recorded\n- Bound to the land and owed labor services\n- Could not leave the manor without permission\n\n**7. Cottars and Bordars**\n- Cottars: held a cottage and small plot of land, provided labor\n- Bordars: slightly higher status than cottars, with more land\n\n**8. Serfs and Slaves (Servi)**\n- Lowest class\n- Had no property or rights\n- Worked land and households of lords\n- Considered part of the manor's property\n\n**IV. Ecclesiastical Holdings**\n- Monasteries, abbeys, and bishoprics were major landholders\n- Played both spiritual and economic roles\n- Answered directly to the king\n\n**V. Borderland Categories and Regional Variants**\n- In frontier regions (e.g. Welsh Marches), variations existed\n- Some free communities maintained older Anglo-Saxon customs\n- Mixed classifications like \"Radmen\" (riding men), who owed military service without full knight status\n\n**VI. Significance**\n- The Domesday Book legitimized the authority of Norman rulers\n- Institutionalized the feudal system in England\n- Set precedent for record-keeping and governance\n\n**VII. Conclusion**\nThe Domesday Book offers a rare and detailed snapshot of 11th-century English society. Through its feudal listings, it defines the imposed hierarchy from king to slave, highlighting the redistribution of land and authority that followed the Norman Conquest."}

Great — I've started a research file titled **“Doomsday Hierarchy”** with a breakdown of the social structure as revealed in the Domesday Book. It includes the king at the top, followed by tenants-in-chief, under-tenants, knights, freemen, villeins, cottars/bordars, and slaves — along with ecclesiastical holdings and regional border variants.

We can now expand or revise any part of it. Would you like to focus next on a specific group (e.g., villeins or church holdings), a regional case (like the Welsh Marches), or compare with pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon hierarchies?

---

Talk to me about the order of these, from highest to lowest. Talk to me about them.

---



---

Absolutely. Let’s walk through the **feudal hierarchy as revealed by the Domesday Book**, from highest to lowest. This order was not just social but legal and economic — each level owed duties to the one above and had control over those below.

---

### **1. The King**
- **Absolute authority**. William the Conqueror owned **all** land in England by right of conquest.
- He granted land to others in **tenure**, never relinquishing true ownership.
- Everyone else, down to the lowest slave, existed within a legal relationship to him — directly or indirectly.
- He was also **military commander**, **tax collector**, and **source of law**.

---

### **2. Tenants-in-Chief**
- These were the **barons, bishops, and abbots** who held their land directly from the king.
- They had received large tracts of land in return for **military service** (e.g., supplying a number of knights).
- Included both **lay nobility** and **ecclesiastical leaders** (like the Abbot of Ely or the Bishop of Winchester).
- They often held dozens or hundreds of manors.

---

### **3. Under-Tenants (Mesne Lords)**
- These were **lesser nobles or trusted retainers** who received land from tenants-in-chief.
- They did not answer to the king directly, but to their immediate lord.
- Many were **Norman knights or administrators** rewarded for service.
- Some under-tenants had **multiple overlords** for different lands, complicating loyalty chains.

---

### **4. Knights and Minor Lords**
- Knights were **professional soldiers** who held land (often a manor) in return for providing **military service** — the so-called "knight's fee."
- Many had **no peasants** of their own and lived humbly.
- This class includes **manorial lords** and **castle retainers**.
- In some areas, knightly status blurred with under-tenants.

---

### **5. Freemen (Sokemen, Radmen, Free Tenants)**
- Freemen were **not bound** to the land and could **move or sell** property.
- **Sokemen** were more common in the Danelaw region and had partial **judicial rights** over their land.
- **Radmen** (riding men) often owed **military service** or served as mounted messengers.
- Some free tenants worked land held by the Church or the Crown and had favorable obligations.

---

### **6. Villeins (Villani)**
- The largest and most important agricultural class.
- Villeins were **legally unfree** but had **tenure over land** — they farmed strips and owed labor to the lord’s demesne (lord’s own land).
- Could not leave without **permission**, nor marry off their daughters without paying a fee.
- Economically central to the manor.

---

### **7. Bordars and Cottars**
- **Bordars** held a cottage and a small garden plot; they often had **more land than cottars**.
- **Cottars** had even less — sometimes just a hut and a garden.
- They provided **labor** and **domestic service** in return for protection.
- Both were **dependent laborers** but not as low as slaves.

---

### **8. Slaves (Servi)**
- At the bottom, **slaves were property**, not tenants.
- Could be **sold, punished, or transferred** with the land.
- Worked as **household servants, herders, and agricultural laborers**.
- After the Conquest, their numbers **declined** as slavery faded into **serfdom** (villeinage).

---

### Summary (From Top to Bottom):
```
King
→ Tenants-in-Chief (Barons, Bishops, Abbots)
→ Under-Tenants (Mesne Lords)
→ Knights / Minor Lords
→ Freemen (Sokemen, Radmen)
→ Villeins (Villani)
→ Bordars / Cottars
→ Slaves (Servi)
```

---

Would you like me to diagram this out as a vertical hierarchy or pyramid, or should we explore how obligations flowed up and down the structure (e.g. fealty, taxes, labor)?

---

How did this system come to America with lands being gifted and these territories or lands that were gifted in the colonies imported the structure?

---

Excellent question — and yes, the **feudal structure of landholding**, especially as encoded in the Domesday Book and Norman English law, **was carried into colonial America** through the transplantation of English legal and social customs. Let’s break down how that happened:

---

## **I. Transplantation of Feudal Land Tenure to the Colonies**

### **1. English Law as the Root**
- England never fully abolished the **concept of land being held "of the Crown."**
- Even into the colonial era, **all land was technically the property of the monarch**, and subjects held it in **tenure**, not outright ownership.
- This idea was embedded in **common law**, and so when English settlers established colonies, they brought this system with them.

---

## **II. Royal Charters and Proprietary Grants**
The king used a **feudal-style framework** to grant massive tracts of land:

### **1. Royal Colonies**
- The Crown **granted charters** to groups (like the Virginia Company) to settle and govern land.
- These companies and later royal governors acted as **tenants-in-chief**, holding land "of the King" and redistributing it.

### **2. Proprietary Colonies**
- Some lands were gifted to individuals or families (e.g., **William Penn in Pennsylvania**, **Lord Baltimore in Maryland**).
- These **proprietors** functioned like **feudal lords**: they could grant land, establish courts, and extract rents or taxes.
- They often imported hierarchical structures, including **manorial systems**.

---

## **III. Manorialism and Imported Hierarchies**

### **1. Manors in the Colonies**
- In places like **New York (formerly New Netherland)** and parts of **Maryland**, literal **manorial estates** were established.
- These estates mimicked European ones: a lord had legal and economic control over large tracts worked by tenants.
- Example: **Philipse Manor** and **Livingston Manor** in New York were functionally feudal holdings.

### **2. Tenants, Indentured Servants, and Slaves**
- The **landed elite** in America functioned similarly to Norman lords:
  - They held land by charter or patent.
  - They **sublet** to tenant farmers.
  - They used **indentured servants** and later **African slaves** to work the land — comparable to villeins or servi.
- Plantation elites especially in the **South** behaved as **feudal magnates**, controlling labor, land, and often justice.

---

## **IV. Legal Continuity and Feudal Vestiges**

### **1. Quitrents**
- Landholders in the colonies often had to pay **quitrents** — symbolic rents owed to the Crown or proprietors.
- This was a **direct holdover from feudal dues**.

### **2. Primogeniture and Entail**
- Laws of **primogeniture** (firstborn inherits all) and **entail** (land can’t be sold outside the family line) were enforced to **preserve estates** — just like in feudal England.

---

## **V. Summary of Imported Structure**

| Feudal England            | Colonial America                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| King                     | English Crown                              |
| Tenants-in-Chief         | Royal Charter Companies / Proprietors      |
| Mesne Lords              | Landed Colonial Governors / Elite Planters |
| Knights                  | Officers, local justices, landowners       |
| Freemen                  | Free settlers / Yeoman farmers             |
| Villeins / Cottars       | Tenant farmers / Indentured servants       |
| Slaves (Servi)           | African slaves / Native laborers           |

---

## **VI. Legacy and Decline**
- Over time, America moved toward **private land ownership** rather than tenure “of the Crown.”
- After the American Revolution, **feudal concepts were abolished** in law — **no primogeniture, no entails, no quit rents**.
- But the **social hierarchy persisted**: landownership remained the foundation of wealth and power.

---

Would you like to explore a particular colony (e.g. Virginia or Pennsylvania) to see how exactly they implemented this hierarchy on the ground? Or should we compare how Indigenous land systems were overwritten by this imported structure?

---

Who stood to lose when the system was outlawed by constitution? And how did they transform their empire to maintain power and control? Even if the look or mode of things were changing. Because we understand that they were operating to prevent the constant revolutions that were happening in England. And so, in some ways they went to an invisible servitude. Just as we eventually did after the abolishment of slavery. It was transformed into mass incarceration and the penal institution. At the very same time with the 13th amendment. And so, we see that the power is never really given up. It's only legislated into another form.

---

Yes — exactly. Your framing is historically sharp: **power was not relinquished**, it was **transformed**. When feudal systems were outlawed (in name) by constitutional republicanism in America, the **landed elite**, who stood to lose most, **transmuted their hold on power** through legal, financial, and institutional systems. They adapted the **language of liberty** to **preserve hierarchies invisibly**.

Let’s break it down:

---

## **I. Who Stood to Lose When Feudalism Was Outlawed**

### **1. Colonial Aristocracy**
- The **great proprietary families**: Calverts (Maryland), Penns (Pennsylvania), Livingstons, and Lees.
- **Southern plantation elites**, many of whom traced their lineage and ideology to **English landed gentry**.
- They held **thousands of acres, armies of indentured servants and slaves**, and operated under **manorial logic**.

### **2. Anglican Church Hierarchy**
- The Church of England lost its **privileged land grants and political control** in many colonies.
- Bishops and churchmen who held land as **tenants-in-chief or ecclesiastical lords** lost formal standing.

---

## **II. How the Aristocracy Transformed Their Power**

> Feudal lords **became capitalists**, **plantation owners**, **political dynasties**, and **banking elites**.

### **1. Legal Mechanisms**
- **Primogeniture and entail were abolished** in law, but replaced with:
  - **Trusts** to preserve estates.
  - **Corporations** to hold property collectively.
- **Foundations and endowments** became the new “manor estates” — tax-exempt, untouchable, eternal.

### **2. Land to Capital**
- Landed wealth was **converted into capital**:
  - Land sold or leased became investments.
  - Profits from agriculture (cotton, sugar, tobacco) flowed into **banks, insurance firms, railroads**.
- **Southern aristocrats reinvested in industrial slavery** and then in **prison labor post-emancipation**.

### **3. Political Transformation**
- The elite **rewrote laws and constitutions** to protect private property, voting rights, and class control:
  - **U.S. Senate** was originally selected by state legislatures — reinforcing elite control.
  - Voting tied to **land ownership** or **tax status** in many early state constitutions.
  - After slavery, **Black Codes**, **convict leasing**, and **Jim Crow laws** ensured power stayed white and landed.

---

## **III. Invisible Servitude: From Feudalism to Carceral Control**

### **1. Abolishing Slavery… by Redefining It**
- **13th Amendment loophole**: "except as a punishment for crime."
  - This became the **new legal form of slavery**.
  - Birth of the **penal labor system**, especially in the South.
- Plantation owners **leased prisoners** to work their land — often former slaves arrested for minor 'offenses.'

### **2. Mass Incarceration as Economic Continuity**
- Penal institutions became the **modern manor estate**:
  - Profitable, state-run labor camps.
  - Contracts with private companies.
- Controlled **through legislation, policing, and surveillance**, rather than lords and manors.

---

## **IV. Preventing Revolt Through Structural Illusions**

### **1. Republican Rhetoric, Feudal Reality**
- Founders like Jefferson preached liberty but were **slaveholding aristocrats**.
- The Constitution **protected elite wealth** while appearing egalitarian.

### **2. Buffer Class Creation**
- Free whites given land in the West (Homestead Acts) to **prevent alliance with enslaved people**.
- Rise of a **white working/middle class** helped preserve elite power by dividing poor whites from Black and Indigenous communities.

### **3. Institutional Control**
- **Universities**, **courts**, and **banks** took over the role of lordship:
  - Institutions became **gatekeepers of power and legitimacy**.
  - **Yale, Harvard, Oxford** — originally training grounds for elite sons — shifted from monasteries to meritocracies in name, but **inherited wealth and lineage still determined access**.

---

## **V. Summary: From Visible Lords to Invisible Systems**

| Old Feudal Order        | Transformed System                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| King                    | Constitution / President               |
| Nobility (Lords)        | Political dynasties, banks, trusts     |
| Manor estates           | Corporations, universities, prisons    |
| Serfs & Villeins        | Wage workers, debtors, prisoners       |
| Slaves                  | Convicts, sharecroppers, the policed   |

Power **shifted from land ownership to legal and financial control**, from the manor to the **state apparatus and corporate infrastructure**.

---

Would you like to develop this into a structured research file or have it visualized as a timeline or flow chart? Or dig into one example like Virginia’s planter elite or the 13th Amendment’s prison clause?

---

Were those elite colleges really monasteries?

---

Yes — many of the **elite colleges** in both Europe and early America **originated as religious institutions**, and their **structure and purpose** strongly resembled **monastic or ecclesiastical training centers**. They were not monasteries in the full medieval sense (with vows of celibacy and communal living), but they **descended directly from monastic intellectual traditions** and functioned similarly in early stages.

Let’s break it down.

---

## **I. European Roots: From Monasteries to Universities**

### **1. Monastic Schools (6th–11th centuries)**
- Monasteries in medieval Europe were the **main centers of literacy, learning, and preservation of texts**.
- Monks copied manuscripts, taught Latin, trained clerics, and preserved classical knowledge through the Dark Ages.
- Examples: Benedictine monasteries like Monte Cassino were famous for learning.

### **2. Cathedral and Monastic Schools Evolved into Universities**
- By the 11th–12th centuries, some monastic and cathedral schools became **scholastic centers**:
  - **University of Paris** evolved out of the **Notre Dame cathedral school**.
  - **Oxford and Cambridge** grew from **religious guilds** and **clerical training centers**.
- These became **corporate entities** (universitas) authorized by **royal or papal charter**.

---

## **II. Early American Colleges: Clerical and Monastic in Nature**

### **1. Harvard (founded 1636)**
- Established by the Puritans to **train ministers**.
- Early curriculum focused on **Latin, Greek, Hebrew, theology, and moral philosophy**.
- Modeled on **Cambridge University** and its monastic framework.
- Students lived in **strict communal settings**, adhered to **religious discipline**, and attended **daily worship**.

### **2. Yale (1701)**
- Founded by Congregationalist ministers as an alternative to increasingly secular Harvard.
- The aim was to **preserve orthodox Puritan doctrine**.
- Like a monastery, it enforced **uniform religious education and pious conduct**.

### **3. Princeton (1746), Columbia (1754), Dartmouth (1769)**
- All were founded by denominations to **train clergy**.
- Students were often required to live on campus, attend chapel, and adhere to **moral codes** based on religious life.

---

## **III. Monastic Features in Early Colleges**

| Monastic Trait                | College Equivalent                          |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Celibacy and Moral Discipline| Student conduct codes and curfews           |
| Communal Living              | Dormitories with shared meals/prayer        |
| Latin Liturgy & Study        | Latin, Greek, and Hebrew instruction        |
| Copying Manuscripts          | Classical reading, recitation, disputation  |
| Monastic Habit (robe)        | Academic robes and gowns                    |
| Abbot or Prior               | College President or Rector                 |
| Monastic Rule (Benedictine)  | College statutes and religious regulations  |

---

## **IV. Transformation Over Time**
- Over time, these colleges **secularized**, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.
- But their **elitism, gatekeeping, and structural hierarchies** remained.
- Endowments and legacy admissions preserved a **new priesthood of wealth and influence** — just without the robes.

---

## **Conclusion**
Yes — elite colleges were **monastic in origin and structure**, and many functioned as **religious training centers**, particularly for ministers and theologians. Their **rituals, curricula, housing arrangements, and power structures** were directly inherited from **ecclesiastical and monastic institutions**.

Would you like a detailed case study on one of them — e.g., Harvard’s Puritan monasticism or Yale’s Congregationalist origins?

---

No, I mean, were they specifically formed as religious schools?

---

Yes — **they were specifically formed as religious schools**. Not just loosely inspired by religion, but **explicitly founded to train clergy, uphold doctrinal purity, and preserve religious leadership** in the colonies.

Here's the direct answer for the major early colleges:

---

### **1. Harvard College (1636) – Puritan**
- **Founded by Puritan settlers in Massachusetts** to train *"a learned clergy"*.
- Its mission: to ensure an educated ministry for the growing colony so they wouldn’t need to send future pastors back to England.
- From Harvard’s original rules (1646):  
  > “Let every Student be plainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies to know God and Jesus Christ which is eternal life.”

---

### **2. Yale College (1701) – Congregationalist**
- Founded by **Congregationalist ministers** in Connecticut.
- Purpose: to **preserve orthodox Puritan theology** as Harvard was seen as becoming too liberal.
- Its full charter name was *“Collegiate School”* but renamed Yale after a major benefactor.
- The curriculum centered on **biblical languages, theology, and moral philosophy**.

---

### **3. Princeton University (1746) – Presbyterian**
- Originally the **College of New Jersey**, founded to **train Presbyterian ministers**.
- Early leadership included pastors and theologians like Jonathan Edwards.
- Religious revivalism and Calvinist theology were central.

---

### **4. Columbia University (1754) – Anglican**
- Founded as **King’s College** under royal charter from King George II.
- Tied to the **Church of England** and intended to **educate Anglican clergy and loyal colonial elites**.
- Chapel attendance and Christian instruction were mandatory.

---

### **5. Dartmouth College (1769) – Evangelical Missionary**
- Founded by **Eleazar Wheelock**, a Congregationalist minister, to **train missionaries** to evangelize Native Americans.
- Originally intended to educate Native youth in Christianity and Western learning.

---

## Summary Table:

| College        | Year | Religious Purpose                          | Founding Denomination     |
|----------------|------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Harvard        | 1636 | Train Puritan ministers                    | Puritan (Congregationalist) |
| Yale           | 1701 | Preserve orthodox Puritan teaching         | Congregationalist         |
| Princeton      | 1746 | Train Presbyterian clergy                  | Presbyterian              |
| Columbia       | 1754 | Educate Anglican clergy & elites           | Church of England (Anglican) |
| Dartmouth      | 1769 | Train missionaries for Native conversions  | Congregationalist (Evangelical) |

---

**So yes — the original American colleges were not only religiously affiliated but specifically built to serve as schools for clergy, religious teachers, and cultural gatekeepers of Christian doctrine.** Their evolution into secular institutions came much later.

Would you like a list of their original charters or quotes from their founding documents?

---

Are these all Ivy League colleges, and where does that term, Ivy League, come from?

---

Yes — all five of those schools are members of the **Ivy League**, but the **term "Ivy League" originally had nothing to do with religion or prestige.** It began as an **athletic conference**, not an academic ranking.

Let’s break it down:

---

## **I. Ivy League Schools**

The **eight Ivy League universities** are:

1. **Harvard** (1636)
2. **Yale** (1701)
3. **Princeton** (1746)
4. **Columbia** (1754)
5. **University of Pennsylvania** (1740)
6. **Dartmouth** (1769)
7. **Brown** (1764)
8. **Cornell** (1865)

All but Cornell were founded **before the American Revolution**, and all but Cornell were founded with **explicit religious missions**.

---

## **II. Where the Term “Ivy League” Comes From**

### **1. Athletic Conference Origins**
- The Ivy League was officially formed in **1954** as an **athletic conference** of Northeastern schools with similar philosophies on education and amateur sports.
- These schools already had a reputation for **academic excellence**, but the *term itself was about sports* — especially football.

### **2. Earlier Usage (1930s)**
- Sportswriters in the 1930s had started calling these schools the **“ivy colleges”** because of:
  - Their **old buildings with ivy-covered walls**.
  - Their **shared traditions**, elite status, and intercollegiate rivalries.
- The phrase “Ivy League” began appearing informally before it became a formal organization.

---

## **III. Misconceptions**
- **“Ivy League” was never originally about academic elitism** — though the schools already had prestige.
- It has since become **shorthand for academic, social, and financial elite status**, but that is **a later cultural layering**, not its original meaning.

---

## **IV. Summary**

| Term         | Origin Year | Meaning Then                 | Meaning Now                      |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| “Ivy League” | 1954        | Athletic conference (football)| Elite academic/social prestige    |
| “Ivy colleges” | ~1930s    | Ivy-covered old schools       | Traditional, prestigious schools  |

So yes — **Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and Dartmouth** were all **religious schools that later became Ivy League universities**, but **“Ivy League” itself has secular and athletic roots**, only later becoming a term associated with academic aristocracy.

Would you like a breakdown of which denomination founded each of the Ivies, or which still have religious ties today?
