# Jeremiah vs Paul Prophets



---



---

Let’s look at Jeremiah 23 and compare what is being said to what Paul writes and does as well. When they talk about the prophets that have had their own visions out their imagination, how does that fit into Paul’s experience? They said who has walked with God in the council of God.? That would be Moses . Paul only had one vision in his imagination and the people have forsaken the law! Again Paul talks of running a race.  Jeremiah 23 says I have not sent them but they run.  On and on it seems Paul is described as the false prophet’s epitome.  
Let’s break down Jeremiah 23 in this way

Excellent. Jeremiah 23 is one of the most forceful prophetic denunciations of false prophets in the Hebrew Bible, and analyzing it in parallel with Paul’s claims and actions offers a meaningful case study in evaluating prophetic legitimacy based on Torah criteria. Let’s work verse by verse (or section by section) and compare Jeremiah's indictments with Paul’s writings and behaviors.

---

### **Jeremiah 23:1–2 — Woe to the Shepherds**
> *“Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord.”*

- **Context**: This is an indictment of leaders who have failed to care for and instead scattered the people.
- **Comparison**: Paul boasts of being the “apostle to the Gentiles” and claims the Jews have rejected salvation (Romans 11:11), thereby justifying a new mission. But this raises the question: did he *gather* Israel, or *scatter* it?
- **Contrast with Moses**: Moses intercedes for Israel even when they sin (Exodus 32:11–14), seeking their preservation, not replacement.

---

### **Jeremiah 23:9–11 — The Land is Full of Adulterers**
> *“For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the Lord.”*

- **Moral Decay**: Prophets and priests are described as corrupt, leading the people into moral and spiritual confusion.
- **Paul’s Angle**: Paul advocates doctrines that many argue replace obedience to the law with belief alone (Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16), potentially enabling a kind of moral laxity.
- **Result**: This undermines the law given through Moses, contrary to Deuteronomy 13:1–5 which says even if a prophet performs signs but leads people away from the law, he is false.

---

### **Jeremiah 23:16–17 — They Speak a Vision of Their Own Heart**
> *“They speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.”*

- **Paul’s Vision**: Paul’s Damascus road experience (Acts 9, retold with slight variations in Acts 22 and 26) is private and unverified. He uses it to assert his authority, claiming direct revelation (Galatians 1:11–12).
- **Contrast**: True prophets like Moses receive public signs and confirm God’s word through Torah-consistent instruction (Deut. 18:15–22).
- **Further**: Paul rebukes those who demand signs (1 Corinthians 1:22–23), yet signs were central to validating prophets in Hebrew Scripture.

---

### **Jeremiah 23:18 — Who Has Stood in the Council of the Lord?**
> *“For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived and heard his word?”*

- **Moses as Model**: Numbers 12:6–8 sets Moses apart as one who speaks with God “face to face,” seeing the form of the Lord.
- **Paul’s Claims**: Paul never claims to have seen God, only a light and a voice. He explicitly admits his gospel is not from man, nor taught by others (Gal. 1:12), yet it diverges from the apostolic witness.
- **Implication**: Standing in God's council implies receiving instruction aligned with prior revelation, not contradicting it.

---

### **Jeremiah 23:21 — I Did Not Send These Prophets, Yet They Ran**
> *“I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.”*

- **Paul’s Use of ‘Running’**: Paul frequently uses the metaphor of running:
  - *“I have finished my course”* (2 Timothy 4:7)
  - *“Know ye not that they which run in a race run all…”* (1 Corinthians 9:24)
  - *“Lest I had run, or had run in vain”* (Galatians 2:2)
- **Irony**: Jeremiah condemns prophets who run without being sent. Paul’s running, though claimed to be divinely ordained, lacks confirmation by Torah and is rooted in private vision.

---

### **Jeremiah 23:22 — If They Had Stood in My Council**
> *“But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way...”*

- **Measure of a True Prophet**: Brings people back to the law and repentance.
- **Paul’s Effect**: His gospel emphasizes grace over law (Romans 6:14), leading some to claim the law is obsolete (see Romans 10:4).
- **Jesus’ Standard**: *“Whosoever shall do and teach them [the commandments], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven”* (Matthew 5:19).

---

### **Jeremiah 23:25–27 — Dreams to Cause Forgetting of God’s Name**
> *“Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams...”*

- **Paul’s Gospel**: Introduces theological language (e.g., justification by faith, original sin, resurrection of the dead) that shifts the focus from Yahweh's covenant with Israel to a universalized abstraction.
- **Forgetting the Name**: Is it a coincidence that Paul’s teachings led to Gentile Christianity that largely abandoned Hebrew names, the Sabbath, and Torah observance?

---

### **Jeremiah 23:29 — Is Not My Word Like a Fire?**
> *“Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?”*

- **Criterion**: True words of God break down falsehood and call to covenant obedience.
- **Paul’s Impact**: Often divisive (Galatians 2:11–14), even among apostles. His letters sometimes obscure rather than clarify Torah, using philosophical and rhetorical devices.

---

### **Conclusion**
Jeremiah 23 offers a standard by which to measure prophets:  
- Have they stood in God’s council?  
- Do they lead people back to the law?  
- Are their visions rooted in divine command or private imagination?  
- Do they gather or scatter?  
- Do they cause people to forget God’s Name or remember it?

By these standards, **Paul appears more aligned with Jeremiah’s description of the false prophet** than with Moses or any Torah-aligned figure. His authority is based on unverifiable vision, and his message diverges from the covenant framework given to Israel.
