# Logo Concepts for Foundation



---



---

This image is a logo I’m working on for my nonprofit ‘YIELD AiS FOUNDATION’ 
Youth, intervention and education for life development  Autism intervention systems foundation. It flips the yield sign and the inverted triangle represents the A for Autism a no capitalization i for intervention is in the middle and has the “S” backwards wrapping around the ‘i’. This represents the snake and together they form the snake and staff of the nursing symbol. The shape of the reversed s seems to wrap the I like a snake but also give a swirling rising sense like the I is twirling, even ascending. The dot of the i is the head of a boy. This represents the motion of spinning like an autistic person ‘stimming’. This is why the yield triangle is also pointing upward. We seek to create a symbol the raises awareness and the level of intervention for autism to a public consciousness. ‘YIELD’. The sign also resembles a figure in motion running, the s creating arms and a leg raises in a running stride, the stem of the i being the other leg. Can you improve this given my goals?

To improve the design of the logo for the 'YIELD AiS FOUNDATION,' which focuses on autism intervention and education for life development, it's important to simplify and clarify the elements to ensure the message is conveyed effectively. Here's a proposed approach:

1. **Simplify the Iconography:** Use a cleaner, more geometric version of the inverted triangle to maintain the association with the yield sign and the letter 'A' for Autism.
2. **Integrate the 'i' and 'S':** Design a more stylized 'i' where the 'S' curves around it in a clear, snake-like manner, keeping the 'S' recognizable yet clearly part of a cohesive symbol.
3. **Emphasize Movement:** The figure should suggest motion but in a subtle way that keeps the primary message of autism intervention clear. The raised leg could be a gentle curve that complements the overall design.
4. **Color and Texture:** Use solid colors with a slight gradient or texture to add depth while keeping the logo scalable and legible in various sizes.
5. **Typography:** Choose a clear and readable typeface for 'YIELD AiS FOUNDATION' that balances well with the iconography. The typeface should be modern and approachable.

By refining these elements, the logo can maintain its original intent while becoming more professional, legible, and scalable for various uses. Would you like me to create a visual example based on these suggestions?

Here are two logo concepts for the 'YIELD AiS FOUNDATION'. Each design incorporates the elements you described — an inverted triangle, the stylized 'i' with the backward 'S', and the upward direction to represent progress. The color schemes are strong yet welcoming, and the typography is designed to be clear and readable. These concepts should align with the goals of raising awareness and intervention for autism.

---

The spelling is incorrect on both. It should read “YIELD” “AiS”.

Here are the revised logo designs for the 'YIELD AiS FOUNDATION' with the correct spelling. Each design integrates your concept of an upward-pointing triangle with the stylized 'i' and backward 'S', along with a color palette that is inviting and professional.

---

Thanks these are cool. I don’t get the sense of the i  and intertwining s creating this ⚕️  as a running or twirling boy:⚕️is the center of the piece with the s being the snake. 

---

I understand you're looking for a design where the 'i' and the backward 'S' integrate more closely to resemble the medical symbol of the staff and snake, while also conveying the idea of a running or twirling boy. The symbol ⚕️ (the Rod of Asclepius) is traditionally a single snake around a staff, which in this case is represented by the 'i'. To meet your vision, the 'S' must be more clearly snake-like and the 'i' more prominent as a staff, with the dot above the 'i' representing the head of a boy to suggest movement or spinning.

Given this feedback, would you like me to attempt another iteration of the logo with these adjustments?

---

Yes please

The updated designs incorporate the elements you've described, blending the medical symbol with the concept of motion and ascension. The integration aims to symbolize the support and upward progress for individuals with autism as envisioned by your foundation.

---

The second image is good, except that we lost the concept of do you sign pointing upwards although I do understand the design concept because it looks well. But that’s an important element of the philosophy. I also would like to add the yellow colors back I am in I like to the complete design of it, except that it looks like a serpent is eating the boys head.

The revised designs incorporate the upward direction of the yield sign, with the 'i' and 'S' forming a symbol that avoids the impression of a snake eating the boy's head. Yellow has been added to bring vibrancy and warmth to the design.

---

These are progressively less on target. Your first 4 images really are good. Go back to those and incorporate this symbol but not at the cost of the spiraling

---

Blue was better as I said the first concepts were good (blue, white) integrate some yellow but you have changed the character and this no longer look professional or discernible for my organizational ethos
