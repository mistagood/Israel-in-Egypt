# Astrological Spiritual Transition



---



---

We, the children of the Aquarian Age, are the living waters Jesus spoke of. John said, One comes after me, who is preferred before me, because he was before me. In an astrological view, John is the water bearer and Jesus is the Pisces or the two fish. Therefore, Pisces comes after the water bearer. But, in the procession of the equinox, we see that Aquarius, or the water bearer, will follow Pisces. And will signal the return of the Christ, or Messiah, or Anointing.

In the tapestry of celestial signs interwoven with scriptural narrative, the account of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ draws intriguing parallels to the astrological ages of Aquarius and Pisces. The biblical John, symbolically represented as the Water Bearer, foreshadows the one who follows him, Jesus, represented by the two fishes of Pisces. This symbolism echoes through the ages, prophesying a shift in spiritual epochs.

John's declaration, "One comes after me, who is preferred before me, because he was before me," can be seen not only in a literal sense but also as a profound astrological prophecy. In the precession of the equinoxes, each age transitions into the next, suggesting a cyclical return to earlier spiritual truths and revelations. As the age of Pisces, marked by faith and sacrifice, gives way to Aquarius, an age characterized by knowledge, humanitarianism, and enlightenment, we encounter the promise of a new spiritual awakening. This shift, often referred to as the Age of Aquarius, heralds a period where the living waters—perhaps the flowing of higher wisdom and collective consciousness—refresh the world, symbolizing the return or reawakening of the Christ consciousness in a universal or metaphysical form.

Thus, the transition from the age of Pisces to Aquarius could be seen as not just an astronomical passage but as a transformative spiritual event, indicating the resurgence of the anointing spirit among humanity, leading to a collective elevation in understanding and living out divine principles. This celestial interpretation offers a powerful perspective on the dynamics of spiritual evolution, suggesting that we are entering a time where the divine is experienced more as a shared and living reality than as distant historical events.
