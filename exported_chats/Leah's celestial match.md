According to your *Mazarroth* chart, Leah’s house would best align with **Betulah (Virgo)** — the *Maiden* — since Virgo in Hebrew is **בְּתוּלָה (*Betulah*)**, meaning “virgin” or “maiden.”  

In your mapping, **Betulah (Virgo)** corresponds not directly to Leah herself, but to her daughter **Dinah** and “the house of Joseph.” Yet symbolically, that *house* represents Leah’s broader line — her labor, fruitfulness, and nurturing role in Israel’s growth. The “hidden feminine giving birth to the Fish” (Ephraim and Manasseh) describes Leah’s seed continuing through Joseph’s union with Dinah’s daughter Asenath, who becomes mother of the two fish.  

So, if we extend the pattern:  
Leah’s celestial mirror is **Betulah (Virgo)** — the mother of increase, the harvester, the fruitful earth.  

Her *matching constellation*, then, is **Virgo/Betulah**, and her *complementary house* in the male line would be **Dagim (Pisces)** — her descendants’ sign through Joseph’s line — forming the *mother-and-sons* pairing across the Mazzaroth.

---

Well, Dinah already has that, so we're looking for a different constellation. That could be Leah.

---

Good — that’s an important distinction. Dinah holds **Betulah (Virgo)** as her own house — the maiden who gives birth to the Fish — so Leah, as *the matriarchal source*, must precede and encompass that role rather than mirror it.  

If we look through the *Mazarroth* table again:  

Leah’s defining traits are fertility, labor, endurance, and the bearing of six sons — the foundation of Israel’s body. She embodies *the womb of the nation* rather than a single offspring. So, we need a constellation that speaks of *nurturing abundance*, *domestic enclosure*, and *continuity through cycles*.  

The most natural candidate from the existing constellations would be **Sartan (Cancer)** — *the Crab* or *the Grasping One* — associated with **Zebulun** in the table, Leah’s sixth son.  

Sartan’s Hebrew sense — a shell, a dwelling, a safe harbor — aligns beautifully with Leah’s nature as “the tent-dweller,” the stable wife whose sons built the house of Israel. Cancer’s symbolism of home, containment, and motherly defense also matches her emotional role as the one unloved yet steadfast, whose womb God continually opens.  

So, while Dinah personifies **Betulah (Virgo)**, Leah herself would correspond most fittingly to **Sartan (Cancer)** — the *mother-house* of the tribes.  
Leah = **Sartan (Cancer)** → “the Dwelling, the Harbor, the Shell” — *the mother of the camp of Israel.*

Okay, Leah is not one of the children. She's not one of Jacob's children, so she's not going to beat any of those constellations. The question was about the constellation Lyra and if it's a good fit.

---

Excellent correction — right, Leah belongs to the **parental generation**, not to the tribal–constellation set of Jacob’s sons.  

So, if we’re evaluating **Lyra** — the Lyre — as a possible match for Leah, let’s look at the symbolism through that generational lens rather than the tribal one.  

Lyra’s central star, **Vega**, is one of the brightest in the sky and was once the pole star thousands of years ago. In myth, the Lyre is the *instrument of harmony and devotion* — it tames chaos with song, draws beasts to gentleness, and binds heaven and earth through music. The Hebrew corollary might be found in the **kinnor**, the stringed instrument of David, or the harp of prophecy.  

Now, how does that resonate with Leah?  
Leah’s story is about *disharmony turned to praise*. Her early sorrow at being unloved transforms into worship: her final son by Jacob is named **Judah**, from *odeh*, “I will praise.” Leah, not Rachel, names the tribe that becomes the line of kings and singers. She births the voice of worship into Israel’s lineage.  

So, viewed astronomically:  
– **Lyra** is the constellation of *sound and praise*;  
– **Leah** is the mother whose line gives birth to *Judah*, the singer and the lion.  

That’s a clean resonance. Lyra’s placement near **Hercules** (the strong man, reminiscent of Jacob’s labor and struggle) and **Cygnus** (the swan, symbol of grace and union) adds depth — Leah sits between struggle and grace, translating toil into harmony.  

So yes — **Lyra fits Leah beautifully** as her celestial counterpart:  
**Lyra = Leah**, the matriarch whose endurance becomes praise, whose house births the music of Israel.
