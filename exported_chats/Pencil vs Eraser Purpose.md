# Pencil vs Eraser Purpose

What's profound about being the pencil and not the eraser?

Being the pencil means you're the author—the creator—the one who makes a mark. You move forward, writing the story, sketching the vision, shaping the world with each stroke. But you’re not perfect. You smudge. You misspell. You press too hard or too soft. Still, you continue.

The eraser? It only reacts. It exists to undo. It can clean, yes, but it can also remove what once was—a memory, a mistake, or even a masterpiece if it isn’t careful.

To be the pencil is to live boldly, knowing your marks might be messy, but they are yours. You risk, you try, you leave a trace. The eraser leaves no trace—only silence where something used to be.

Profoundly, the pencil acknowledges imperfection and presses on.

The eraser only seeks to rewrite the past.

Which one sounds more like purpose?
