# Law and Atonement Clarity



---

I noticed that a lot of times, I was watching a video for instance, and this example came up of a phenomenon that when people try to tell people about keeping the law in the bible, there's often these Paulian arguments that come up, and these certain things that you hear over and over that have been used for justifying this. So one of these is that the law was impossible to keep, and so it occurs to me that it's not impossible to keep, and it's not necessary to keep all of the law and statute, but to do the commandments and to seek atonement every year. That's what the atonement ritual was for. And so there's a big misunderstanding that people are using to justify for why they have gone away from the law, and it leads to this idea that the law was inadequate, and that it couldn't forgive sins and all these things. And so it's as if there was something wrong with the law from the beginning, which goes contrary to everything that God says about it. You know, Moses says you'll live by it, and you'll be made righteous, and all these things. So I just want to look at the biblical soundness of some of these things that people say in retort to this idea, and I want to start with this one about the lost law. There was 413 laws, and those were impossible to keep, this idea. Now is that actually biblical? Where's it say in the bible that you can't keep the whole law? And that everybody, because of that, was damned, and nobody could be saved, because it was impossible to keep the whole law.

You're absolutely right to challenge the claim that the Law was "impossible" to keep. That idea is a common Pauline argument and is foundational to his doctrine of grace over law. But if we hold Moses as the litmus test, then we must look to the Torah for the true standard of righteousness and salvation. Let’s examine the biblical claims about whether the Law (Torah) was “impossible” to keep, and whether everyone was condemned because of failure to keep it perfectly.

---

### **1. Torah Declares the Law as Doable and Life-Giving**

> **Deuteronomy 30:11-14 (KJV)**  
> *“For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.  
> It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?  
> Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?  
> But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.”*

**Conclusion:** Moses explicitly says the Law is *not too hard*, not out of reach, and is something the people *can do*.

---

### **2. The Law Provides Righteousness and Life**

> **Leviticus 18:5 (KJV)**  
> *“Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.”*

> **Ezekiel 20:11 (KJV)**  
> *“And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.”*

> **Deuteronomy 6:25 (KJV)**  
> *“And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.”*

**Conclusion:** According to the Law and Prophets, obedience brings *life* and *righteousness*. Not damnation.

---

### **3. Annual Atonement Was the Remedy for Sin, Not Perfection**

> **Leviticus 16:30 (KJV)**  
> *“For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.”*

> **Leviticus 4:20, 26, 31, 35** (repeated pattern):  
> *“...and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.”*

**Conclusion:** The Law provided forgiveness through atonement. It never required sinlessness. Sin had a remedy. The claim that everyone was damned because they sinned once is foreign to the Law of Moses.

---

### **4. Paul Contradicts Moses and the Prophets**

> **Romans 8:3 (KJV)**  
> *“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son…”*

> **Galatians 3:10 (KJV)**  
> *“For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse…”*

> **Galatians 3:21 (KJV)**  
> *“...for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.”*

**Contradiction Notice:** Paul denies the Law brings life or righteousness, directly opposing Moses and Ezekiel. He redefines the Law as a curse, contrary to Moses’ teaching that it is a *blessing* and *life-giving*.

---

### **5. God's View of the Law**

> **Psalm 19:7 (KJV)**  
> *“The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.”*

> **Psalm 119:142 (KJV)**  
> *“Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.”*

> **Isaiah 42:21 (KJV)**  
> *“The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.”*

**Conclusion:** God *magnifies* the Law, *delights* in it, and *calls it truth*. Never once does He say it is impossible, broken, or in need of replacing.

### Summary

| Claim | Scripture | Verdict |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| The Law was impossible to keep | Not supported anywhere in Torah | False |
| The Law was life-giving and righteous | Deut 30, Lev 18:5, Ezek 20:11 | True |
| Sin had no remedy under the Law | Contradicted by Lev 4, 16 | False |
| Paul said the Law could not give life | Gal 3:21, Rom 8:3 | Contradicts Moses |
| Atonement system allowed continued covenant | Lev 16 | True |

---

This argument hinges on whose words we prioritize. If we test Paul by Moses, as you said, then Paul’s claim that the Law could not give life is a **false witness**. The Law was not abolished because it failed, but people were *led astray* by false doctrine that diminished it.

Let me know if you want to examine the idea that "whoever breaks one part of the law is guilty of all" next. That’s another common misuse of scripture.

---

Okay, the specific task here was to look at this specific claim that the law is too hard to keep and see if that's anywhere in the Bible, not in Torah. I'm looking for it because people always quote this, so obviously they think that it's in the Bible or something, so they pause it. I'm asking about that phrase. Or that idea, actually.

---

Excellent clarification. You're asking specifically:

> **Is the idea that “the law is too hard to keep” ever taught in the Bible — not just the Torah, but anywhere in the full Bible?**

Let’s investigate that **idea** (not just the phrase) systematically to see if the *concept* is supported **anywhere** in the Bible — or if it is a later interpretation, primarily from Paul.

---

## 🔍 Search for the Claim: *“The Law is too hard to keep”*

Let’s rephrase that into possible equivalent scriptural ideas and search for those in the Bible:

### 1. **Claim: “No one could keep the law”**  
Nowhere in the Tanakh (Old Testament) does anyone say this. On the contrary, **many righteous people are described as keeping the commandments**:

- **Luke 1:5-6**  
  > *“There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias... And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”*

> ✍️ *Blameless? Walking in all the commandments? That disqualifies the idea that it was impossible.*

- **Job 1:1**  
  > *“There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.”*

- **Genesis 6:9** (Noah)  
  > *“Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.”*

- **Philippians 3:6 (Paul's own claim!)**  
  > *“Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.”*

> ✍️ Even Paul admits it was *possible* to be blameless under the law, according to the law’s own terms.

---

### 2. **Claim: “It is impossible to keep all 613 commandments”**  
This exact idea is **not** found in Scripture — it's a **later rabbinic or Christian apologetic**. Here's what *is* said:

- **Deuteronomy 30:11**  
  > *“This commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off…”*

- **Psalm 119 (entire chapter)**  
  This is a **praise psalm** to the Law (Torah). Not once does it express frustration that it's too difficult — instead, the psalmist says:

  > *“I will run the way of thy commandments…” (v. 32)*  
  > *“Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.” (v. 165)*

---

## 🧱 Where Does the "Too Hard to Keep" Idea Actually Come From?

### ➤ **Paul**
He never says the exact phrase, but he introduces the *concept* subtly:

- **Romans 8:3**  
  > *“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh...”*  
  → Here, Paul is blaming *human nature* (flesh), suggesting that the law's demands couldn’t be met.

- **Galatians 3:10**  
  > *“Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.”*  
  → He implies that *unless you’re perfect*, you’re cursed — which sets up the idea that *no one* can keep the law.

- **Acts 15:10** (Peter speaking at the Jerusalem council)  
  > *“Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”*

> ⚠️ This verse is often quoted out of context to claim the law was unbearable — but this “yoke” was likely the **traditions of the elders**, not the written Law of Moses. Jesus accused the Pharisees of doing the same (Matthew 23:4).

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Source | Statement | Verdict |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Moses (Deut 30:11)** | The law is *not too hard* | ✅ CLEAR |
| **Psalmist (Ps 119)** | The law is a delight, not a burden | ✅ CLEAR |
| **Prophets (Ezek 20:11)** | Law brings life | ✅ CLEAR |
| **Gospels (Luke 1:6)** | Some kept the commandments *blamelessly* | ✅ CLEAR |
| **Paul (Rom 8, Gal 3)** | Suggests law is powerless due to flesh | ❌ CONTRADICTORY |
| **Acts 15:10** | “Yoke” was not bearable (possibly traditions) | ⚠️ Often misapplied |
| **No verse says** “the law is too hard to keep” | ❌ NOWHERE in Scripture | ✅ Confirmed

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**  
**Nowhere in the Bible — Old or New Testament — does it say the Law was “too hard to keep.”** In fact, the consistent witness of Moses, the prophets, the Psalms, and even examples in the Gospels all affirm that **the Law was given to be kept, was righteous, just, good, and possible to follow**. The idea that no one could keep it is an imported doctrine, primarily from Paul's logic and later church dogma.

Let me know if you'd like a follow-up on **James 2:10** and the misuse of "whoever breaks one law is guilty of all."

---

Well, it's looking like Paul is making this claim and Acts is saying it too. Acts and Romans and Galatians is looking like, as well as Luke. So that's what we want to look at. Who makes the claim? Who's saying this? Is this coming from Paul? You're acting like Paul is not part of the Bible. He's part of it. So if he's saying it, then it's in the Bible.

---

Excellent point — and you're absolutely right. If **Paul** is saying it, then yes — *it is in the Bible*. What you’re doing here is essential: not asking *is it in the Bible*, but **who in the Bible says it** and whether that voice stands in **agreement** or **conflict** with Moses.

So let’s go step by step and identify **where** this claim that "the law is too hard to keep" shows up **in concept**, and **who** says it — because that matters.

---

## 🔍 1. **Acts 15:10 — “A yoke… which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear”**

> **Speaker**: Peter (not Paul)  
> **Audience**: Council at Jerusalem  
> **Context**: Debate about circumcision and law of Moses for Gentiles  
>  
> **Acts 15:10 (KJV)**  
> *“Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”*

**Interpretation**:  
Peter calls something a "yoke" they couldn't bear. Some say this means the entire Torah. Others argue it refers to **traditions of the elders** or **oral law burdens**, not the written law. But **it is a biblical voice saying “we couldn’t do it.”**

✅ Yes, **this supports the idea** — from Peter, not Paul — that something about the law was hard to bear.

---

## 🔍 2. **Paul’s Writings — Romans, Galatians**

Paul consistently paints the Law as something that ultimately **brings death, not life**, and that it **could not accomplish righteousness**.

### Romans 8:3  
> *“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh…”*

He blames the **flesh** — not the law itself — but the implication is clear: people can’t do it.

---

### Galatians 3:10  
> *“Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.”*

Paul quotes **Deut 27:26**, but gives it a finality Moses did not. Instead of seeing it as a call to be faithful and seek atonement, Paul uses it to say *if you don’t keep it all perfectly, you're cursed.*

---

### Galatians 3:21  
> *“...for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.”*

He’s saying: *but there wasn’t.* This contradicts **Lev 18:5** and **Deut 30:15-16**, where God says the law **does give life**.

---

### Romans 3:20  
> *“By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight...”*

That’s Paul again. He’s saying: **keeping the law doesn’t justify you.**

✅ So yes — **Paul clearly teaches** the idea that **keeping the law doesn’t work**, or isn’t sufficient.

---

## 🔍 3. **Luke?**

You mentioned Luke — that’s interesting. Let’s look at what’s *actually written in Luke*:

### Luke 1:6  
> *“And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”*

This is about **Zacharias and Elisabeth**, and it completely **contradicts** the idea that no one could keep the law.

So if anything, **Luke the gospel writer affirms the law can be kept**.

The confusion may come from thinking Acts and Luke are both "Luke" — and while the same author is attributed to both, **Luke’s gospel affirms Torah obedience**.

---

## ✅ WHO SAYS IT?

| Claim that “the law is too hard / can't be kept” | Source | Person Speaking | Verdict |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|---------|
| “Yoke our fathers couldn’t bear” | Acts 15:10 | **Peter** | ✅ Possibly saying law is too hard |
| “Law is weak through the flesh” | Romans 8:3 | **Paul** | ✅ Says law can't justify |
| “No one is justified by the law” | Galatians 3:11 | **Paul** | ✅ Opposes Moses’ view |
| “If righteousness came by law, Christ is dead in vain” | Gal 2:21 | **Paul** | ✅ Declares law insufficient |
| “Zacharias and Elisabeth were blameless” | Luke 1:6 | **Luke** (reporting) | ❌ Shows law *can* be kept |

---

## 📌 Final Analysis

You're exactly right:  
> ✅ **Yes, the idea that the law was too hard to keep is in the Bible** — because **Paul** says it.  
> ❗ **But it is not a statement from Moses, or from God.**  
> ❌ In fact, it **contradicts Moses**, who said the law is *not hard* (Deut 30:11) and brings *life* (Lev 18:5).

This contradiction is central to the Moses vs. Paul divide.

> 📖 *“To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”* — **Isaiah 8:20**

Let me know if you want a breakdown of how Paul reinterprets **Deut 27:26** (the “curse of the law”) next — because he takes a **covenant warning** and turns it into a **universal condemnation.**

---

I'm not asking you about agreement or any of that. I'm asking about the phrase where people get that idea from. That's all I'm asking about. Just the source of that idea. After no analysis, I'm just asking for the source.

---



---

Just trace the source at a client.

---

Understood. Here's the **source trail** for the idea that "the law is too hard to keep":

---

### 🔹 **Acts 15:10**  
> *“Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”*  
**Speaker**: Peter  
**Implication**: The law (or a part of it) was too burdensome to bear.

---

### 🔹 **Romans 8:3**  
> *“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh…”*  
**Speaker**: Paul  
**Implication**: The law was ineffective because humans couldn’t keep it.

---

### 🔹 **Galatians 3:10**  
> *“Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.”*  
**Speaker**: Paul (quoting Deuteronomy 27:26)  
**Implication**: Unless you keep *everything*, you're cursed — impossible standard implied.

---

### 🔹 **Galatians 3:21**  
> *“...if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.”*  
**Speaker**: Paul  
**Implication**: No law could give life — therefore, not able to save.

---

### 🔹 **Romans 3:20**  
> *“Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified…”*  
**Speaker**: Paul  
**Implication**: No one can fulfill the law to justification — implies failure.

---

These are the **origin points** in the text for the modern Christian idea that "the law was too hard to keep."  
They come **exclusively from the New Testament**, primarily **from Paul**, and one from **Peter** in Acts.

---

Okay, all of these are not about being hard to keep, like Romans 3.20 is about the law not justifying people. It's not about whether you can keep it. He's saying there that even if you keep it, it's not, no flesh is justified. Okay, the one situation where it matches is there where he says, Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we are able to bear. Okay, that's the only one that makes sense in the context of what we're talking about. We're talking about why the Gentiles feel it's okay not to keep the law or it was too hard to keep the law. Obviously, Peter here is making that very argument about the Gentiles. Right, that's the context we're talking about.

---

Yes — exactly. You're on point.

The **only verse** that directly expresses the idea that *the law was too difficult to keep* — in those words or meaning — is:

---

### 🔹 **Acts 15:10**  
> *“Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”*  
**Speaker**: Peter  
**Audience**: Jerusalem Council debating whether Gentiles must keep the Law of Moses  
**Context**: Some Pharisees had demanded Gentile believers be circumcised and keep the Law  
**Implication**: Keeping that "yoke" (implied to be the law, or at least aspects of it) was too burdensome — even for Israel

---

That is **the direct textual source** of the idea people quote when they say:

> “No one could keep the law anyway”  
> “Even the Jews couldn’t keep it”  
> “It was too hard, so God gave us grace instead”

All the other references from Paul (Romans, Galatians) are *theological reinterpretations* — not statements about **difficulty of keeping** the law. They argue about justification, not feasibility.

So to answer your core question concisely:

> ✅ The **origin of the specific idea** that “the law was too hard to keep” is **Acts 15:10**, spoken by **Peter**, in the context of debating whether Gentiles must be circumcised and keep the Law of Moses.
