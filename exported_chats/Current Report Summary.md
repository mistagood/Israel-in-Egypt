Kern Report, K-E-R-N.

I don't have specific information on a "Kern Report" from my current knowledge. The name doesn't immediately connect to a widely recognized report or study that stands out in recent times.

Could you provide a bit more context? For example, is this related to a specific field, such as education, health, government, or something else? Or is there a particular person or organization associated with it? With more details, I can better help you find the information you're looking for.

There was a report that compared the socioeconomic status of Black people in the 1960s to their status in the 1980s. What was that?

You're referring to the **Kerner Report** (not "Kern"), officially known as the **Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders**, which was published in nineteen sixty-eight. The Kerner Commission was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the causes of the widespread urban riots of the nineteen sixties and to provide recommendations for preventing future unrest.

The Kerner Report famously concluded that the United States was "moving toward two societies, one Black, one White—separate and unequal." It highlighted deep racial disparities in areas like housing, education, employment, and police relations, attributing these to systemic racism, segregation, and economic inequality.

While there wasn't a specific follow-up report by the Kerner Commission comparing the nineteen sixties to the nineteen eighties, the **Kerner Plus 10 Report** (published in nineteen seventy-eight) and other studies in the following decades examined how little progress had been made in addressing the systemic issues outlined in the original report. These subsequent reports often highlighted that many of the problems identified in nineteen sixty-eight, such as disparities in wealth, education, employment, and access to housing, persisted or had even worsened by the nineteen eighties.

The general consensus of these follow-up evaluations was that, despite some progress, significant socioeconomic disparities between Black and White Americans remained, and in some cases, racial inequality had deepened due to economic policies and societal shifts during the intervening years.
