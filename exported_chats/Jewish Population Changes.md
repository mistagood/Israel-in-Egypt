# Jewish Population Changes



---



---

What was the world population of Jews in 1940 and the world population of Jews in 2020?

---



---

The estimated world population of Jews in 1940, just before the Holocaust, was approximately **16.6 million**. This figure, however, dramatically decreased due to the Holocaust, where about 6 million Jews were killed.

By 2020, the global Jewish population had not fully recovered to pre-Holocaust levels. Estimates for the Jewish population in 2020 vary slightly depending on the source, but it is generally considered to be around **14.8 million**.

The Jewish population distribution has also shifted significantly since 1940. Before the Holocaust, a substantial number of Jews lived in Europe. By 2020, the majority of Jews were concentrated in Israel and the United States, with Israel's Jewish population being around 6.8 million and the United States having about 5.7 million Jewish residents.

---

What percentage of growth is that since 1950?

---

To calculate the percentage growth of the Jewish population from 1950 to 2020, we need to know the estimated Jewish population in 1950 and the population in 2020.

The Jewish population in 1950, following the Holocaust, was estimated to be around **11.3 million**. By 2020, as mentioned earlier, the Jewish population was approximately **14.8 million**.

The percentage growth can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Population in 2020} - \text{Population in 1950}}{\text{Population in 1950}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{14.8 - 11.3}{11.3} \right) \times 100 \approx \left( \frac{3.5}{11.3} \right) \times 100 \approx 30.97\%
\]

The percentage growth of the Jewish population from 1950 to 2020 is approximately **31%**.

---

What's the African American population growth rate from 1950 to 2020?

---

To calculate the African American population growth rate from 1950 to 2020, we need the estimated population figures for African Americans in both years.

In 1950, the African American population in the United States was approximately **15 million**. By 2020, the African American population had grown to around **46.8 million**.

Using the percentage growth formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Population in 2020} - \text{Population in 1950}}{\text{Population in 1950}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{46.8 - 15}{15} \right) \times 100 \approx \left( \frac{31.8}{15} \right) \times 100 \approx 212\%
\]

The African American population growth rate from 1950 to 2020 is approximately **212%**.

---

What's the average growth rate of population in the world from 1950 to 2020?

---

To calculate the average growth rate of the world population from 1950 to 2020, we need the estimated world population figures for both years.

In 1950, the estimated world population was around **2.5 billion**. By 2020, the world population had grown to approximately **7.8 billion**.

Using the formula for percentage growth:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Population in 2020} - \text{Population in 1950}}{\text{Population in 1950}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{7.8 - 2.5}{2.5} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5.3}{2.5} \right) \times 100 \approx 212\%
\]

The percentage growth of the world population from 1950 to 2020 is approximately **212%**.

### Average Annual Growth Rate

To find the **average annual growth rate** over 70 years, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Average Annual Growth Rate} = \left( \left( \frac{\text{Population in 2020}}{\text{Population in 1950}} \right)^{\frac{1}{70}} - 1 \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Average Annual Growth Rate} = \left( \left( \frac{7.8}{2.5} \right)^{\frac{1}{70}} - 1 \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Average Annual Growth Rate} \approx (1.0308 - 1) \times 100 \approx 3.08\%
\]

The average annual growth rate of the world population from 1950 to 2020 is approximately **1.76%** per year.

---

I just need the average growth rate just like we have for the other ones. I don't think we had it annually, did we? Or did we?

---

You're right; I didn't provide an annual growth rate for the other populations. I calculated the **total percentage growth** for the Jewish and African American populations. I'll calculate the total percentage growth for the world population from 1950 to 2020 similarly.

Here’s the revised calculation:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Population in 2020} - \text{Population in 1950}}{\text{Population in 1950}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values for the world population:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{7.8 - 2.5}{2.5} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5.3}{2.5} \right) \times 100 \approx 212\%
\]

So, the world population grew by approximately **212%** from 1950 to 2020, which matches the calculation method used for the Jewish and African American populations.

Thank you for the clarification!

How do we account for the dramatic gap in the growth rate of the Jewish population?

---

The dramatic gap in the growth rate of the Jewish population compared to other groups, such as the global population or the African American population, can be attributed to several key factors:

### 1. **The Holocaust and its Aftermath:**
   - The Holocaust (1941-1945) resulted in the genocide of approximately 6 million Jews, which drastically reduced the Jewish population worldwide. In 1950, the Jewish population was still recovering from this catastrophic loss. The impact of the Holocaust created a significant demographic gap that still affects Jewish population growth rates today.

### 2. **Lower Birth Rates:**
   - Compared to other populations, particularly in developing countries or minority groups like African Americans, Jewish communities tend to have lower birth rates. This is influenced by factors such as higher levels of urbanization, access to education, economic conditions, and cultural trends within Jewish communities that prioritize smaller family sizes.

### 3. **Aging Population:**
   - In many Jewish communities, especially in countries like the United States and European nations, the population tends to be older. An aging population naturally leads to lower growth rates due to higher mortality rates and fewer women in childbearing age ranges.

### 4. **Assimilation and Intermarriage:**
   - Assimilation and intermarriage rates have increased in many Jewish communities, particularly in Western countries. While some children from interfaith marriages are raised Jewish, many are not, leading to a slower growth rate for the Jewish population as a distinct religious or ethnic group.

### 5. **Migration and Concentration:**
   - A significant portion of the Jewish population has concentrated in Israel and a few other countries, which can lead to slower growth rates compared to populations spread across many diverse regions. Israel has experienced robust growth rates, but overall global Jewish population growth remains limited due to the smaller base compared to much larger populations worldwide.

### 6. **Differences in Conversion Rates:**
   - Unlike some religions that actively seek converts, Judaism traditionally does not proselytize, meaning growth largely depends on natural increase rather than conversion.

### 7. **Geopolitical and Social Challenges:**
   - Geopolitical factors such as anti-Semitism, restrictive immigration policies in certain periods, and challenges in Jewish diaspora communities have also impacted Jewish population dynamics.

These combined factors have resulted in the Jewish population having a significantly lower growth rate compared to both the global average and other specific groups, such as African Americans, who have experienced different historical, cultural, and socio-economic conditions that facilitated higher growth rates.

---

Okay, we're not talking about the growth of a religion. We're just talking about people multiplying. Since African Americans have faced similar oppression before the 1950s and continue to face it after, as we have other countries which have smaller populations than Israel and have kept up with the birth rate, how do we explain this in the light of African Americans who have also access to all of the things in America as well?

---

You raise an important point about the comparison between the growth rates of African Americans and Jews, particularly considering both groups have faced significant historical oppression and both have access to modern amenities and healthcare in the United States. The stark difference in growth rates between these populations, despite some similarities, can be understood through a combination of demographic, social, cultural, and historical factors:

### 1. **Post-Holocaust Impact and Population Rebuilding:**
   - The Jewish population faced an unprecedented decimation during the Holocaust, which wiped out a significant proportion of its population, including many women and children who would have contributed to future generations. The recovery from this loss has been slow, affecting the natural population growth rate. Unlike the African American population, which has been growing steadily since the end of the transatlantic slave trade, the Jewish population was rebounding from a massive population loss only a few years before 1950.

### 2. **Size of the Population Base:**
   - Growth rates are significantly affected by the size of the initial population. The African American population in 1950 was around 15 million, which is much larger than the approximately 11.3 million Jewish population post-Holocaust. A larger base population naturally allows for more births, compounding growth rates over time.

### 3. **Fertility Rates and Family Size:**
   - African American families in the mid-20th century often had higher fertility rates compared to Jewish families, a trend that continued for several decades. Higher fertility rates mean more children per family, leading to a more substantial population increase. By contrast, Jewish communities, particularly in the United States and Europe, generally have lower fertility rates influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural norms around family size, and later marriage and childbearing.

### 4. **Economic Stability and Family Planning:**
   - As a population gains access to better healthcare, education, and economic stability, fertility rates often decline, which has been observed in many Jewish communities in developed countries. African Americans also have access to these resources, but socio-economic disparities within the United States still exist, influencing family planning differently across demographics.

### 5. **Intermarriage and Identification:**
   - Intermarriage rates among Jews in Western countries, particularly the United States, are relatively high. While some children from interfaith marriages are raised Jewish, a significant number are not, impacting the Jewish population's growth when viewed strictly by religious or ethnic identification. In comparison, African American communities have had lower rates of intermarriage historically, contributing to a more cohesive demographic growth.

### 6. **Cultural Emphasis on Community and Population Growth:**
   - African American communities have historically emphasized resilience and rebuilding through family and community growth, particularly in response to systemic challenges. Large extended families and networks have been a cultural norm, leading to higher birth rates and community continuity.

### 7. **Geopolitical Factors and Immigration:**
   - Israel, the country with the largest Jewish population today, has also experienced steady growth, but that growth has been significantly bolstered by Jewish immigration rather than natural increase alone. African Americans, however, represent a continuous generational lineage in the U.S. with relatively minimal immigration impact, resulting in a steady natural growth rate.

### 8. **Health and Social Factors:**
   - Different health issues, access to resources, and social dynamics impact these populations differently. For example, Jewish populations, particularly in Western countries, often have higher access to reproductive health services, contributing to controlled family sizes. In contrast, variations in access to healthcare and socio-economic conditions in African American communities have led to different growth dynamics.

### Conclusion:
The dramatic difference in growth rates between Jewish and African American populations from 1950 to 2020 is a complex interplay of historical trauma, socio-economic conditions, fertility trends, cultural norms, migration patterns, and demographic base sizes. While both groups have experienced severe oppression, the demographic recovery and growth trajectories have been shaped by different circumstances, contributing to the noticeable differences in growth rates over the 70-year period.

15 million African Americans and 11 or almost 12 million Jews is not a large difference, especially considering the difference now.


---

You're right—15 million African Americans and nearly 12 million Jews in 1950 is not a huge difference in absolute numbers. However, the substantial difference in their growth rates by 2020, where the African American population is around 46.8 million compared to the Jewish population of about 14.8 million, is indeed striking and requires deeper examination beyond just the starting population sizes.

Here are some additional factors that can help explain this disparity in growth rates more precisely:

### 1. **Different Recovery and Growth Patterns Post-1940s:**
   - **African Americans**: After 1950, African Americans experienced a steady and significant population increase, driven by higher fertility rates during the Baby Boom period (1946-1964), better access to healthcare, gradual improvements in civil rights, and economic opportunities that, despite systemic racism, still led to better overall conditions for population growth. The African American birth rate remained relatively high through the mid-20th century, contributing to rapid population expansion.
   - **Jews**: For Jewish populations, especially in the diaspora (such as Europe and the United States), the Holocaust resulted in a demographic bottleneck that had a lasting impact on population growth. The rebuilding of the Jewish population was slower, compounded by lower fertility rates and higher rates of assimilation and intermarriage in subsequent decades.

### 2. **Fertility Rates and Cultural Norms:**
   - African American fertility rates in the mid-20th century were relatively high compared to Jewish fertility rates, which were lower due to various socio-economic and cultural factors. Jewish communities in Western countries often emphasized higher education, professional careers, and later marriage, which are typically associated with lower birth rates. Meanwhile, African American communities, particularly in the post-war era, had larger family sizes, contributing to a faster growth rate.

### 3. **Impact of Urbanization and Economic Conditions:**
   - As urbanization increased and economic conditions improved in the United States, family sizes generally tended to decrease. However, this transition had different timings and impacts on different communities. For Jewish populations in Western countries, urbanization and economic stability were achieved earlier, leading to a shift towards smaller families. In contrast, for many African American communities, urban migration and economic opportunities continued to expand throughout the mid-20th century, allowing for continued growth.

### 4. **Health Disparities and Infant Mortality:**
   - While both groups faced health disparities, African American communities experienced a decline in infant mortality rates from the mid-20th century onwards due to improved access to healthcare and social services. This decline contributed to a higher population growth rate. Jewish populations, having already lower infant mortality rates due to access to resources, did not see a similar percentage increase from this factor.

### 5. **Impact of Immigration and Emigration:**
   - The Jewish population's growth was also influenced by immigration to Israel. Israel's Jewish population grew significantly, but this did not necessarily translate to a comparable increase in the global Jewish population. Meanwhile, the African American population in the U.S. continued to grow from a stable, continuous base with little emigration.

### 6. **Sociopolitical Stability and Reproductive Choices:**
   - African American communities, despite systemic oppression, were relatively stable in terms of their geographic and national presence in the U.S. Jewish populations were scattered globally, facing varying levels of assimilation pressures, cultural integration, and societal dynamics that influenced reproductive choices differently.

### 7. **Community Cohesion and Identity:**
   - African American communities have historically been more cohesive in identity and less affected by the assimilation trends that significantly impacted Jewish populations in diaspora contexts. This cohesion contributed to stronger community growth and family continuity.

### Conclusion:
While the initial populations in 1950 were not vastly different, the Jewish and African American populations have followed divergent growth trajectories due to a combination of demographic recovery rates, fertility patterns, socio-economic factors, cultural norms, community cohesion, and historical contexts. These combined elements have led to a significant difference in population sizes today, with the African American population experiencing robust growth compared to the relatively slower growth of the global Jewish population.

What is the difference in the growth rates?

---

To find the difference in the growth rates between the African American and Jewish populations from 1950 to 2020, we can calculate the growth rate for each group and then determine the difference.

### 1. **African American Population Growth Rate:**

- **1950 Population**: 15 million
- **2020 Population**: 46.8 million

The formula for percentage growth is:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Population in 2020} - \text{Population in 1950}}{\text{Population in 1950}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth for African Americans} = \left( \frac{46.8 - 15}{15} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{31.8}{15} \right) \times 100 \approx 212\%
\]

### 2. **Jewish Population Growth Rate:**

- **1950 Population**: 11.3 million
- **2020 Population**: 14.8 million

Using the same formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Growth for Jews} = \left( \frac{14.8 - 11.3}{11.3} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3.5}{11.3} \right) \times 100 \approx 31\%
\]

### 3. **Difference in Growth Rates:**

\[
\text{Difference} = 212\% - 31\% = 181\%
\]

### Conclusion:

The difference in growth rates between the African American and Jewish populations from 1950 to 2020 is approximately **181%**. This shows that the African American population has grown much more significantly compared to the Jewish population during this period.

---

I need to know how many times greater that is.

---

To determine how many times greater the growth rate of the African American population is compared to the Jewish population from 1950 to 2020, we divide the growth rate of the African American population by the growth rate of the Jewish population.

### Calculation:

- **African American Growth Rate**: 212%
- **Jewish Growth Rate**: 31%

\[
\text{Times Greater} = \frac{\text{African American Growth Rate}}{\text{Jewish Growth Rate}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Times Greater} = \frac{212}{31} \approx 6.84
\]

### Conclusion:

The growth rate of the African American population from 1950 to 2020 is approximately **6.8 times greater** than that of the Jewish population.
