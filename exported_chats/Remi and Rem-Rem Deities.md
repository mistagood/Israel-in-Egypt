What god remi and rem-rem?

"Remi" and "Rem-Rem" don't seem to correspond directly to any well-known deities or mythological figures in major religious or historical texts. However, their names could be linked to several potential interpretations depending on the context.

1. **Remi (or Remus):** This could refer to **Remus**, one of the legendary twin founders of Rome, along with his brother Romulus. In Roman mythology, the twins were said to have been raised by a she-wolf and eventually founded the city of Rome. Romulus later killed Remus in a dispute, which could symbolize the themes of power struggles, brotherly conflict, and the foundation of empires.

2. **Rem-Rem:** While this term doesn’t align with known gods, it may refer to something more modern or esoteric. In ancient Egyptian, "rem" can be associated with water or tears. In an allegorical sense, "rem-rem" could potentially symbolize doubling of this meaning, evoking themes of sorrow, purification, or renewal. Alternatively, in certain contexts, "Rem-Rem" could refer to a personalized or obscure deity, used in more modern or localized spiritual practices.

3. **Possible Spiritual or Esoteric Reference:** Sometimes, terms like these emerge in modern spiritual or esoteric circles as part of personalized deities or figures developed in contemporary practices, combining ancient and modern symbolism.

Without further context, it’s difficult to determine the exact origin or meaning, but these interpretations offer some insights into what the names could signify. Do you have a particular tradition or context where you encountered these terms? That could help narrow down their meaning.

Egyptian rem 

---

In Egyptian, **"rem"** (sometimes written as "rm" or "rmy") has multiple meanings, often connected to water and emotions. Most notably, **"rem"** means "tear" or "weeping." This is significant in Egyptian religious and cultural contexts because tears were often associated with sorrow, mourning, or divine compassion.

For example:
- The goddess **Isis**, who mourned the death of her husband Osiris, is often depicted shedding tears. Her tears were believed to create the flooding of the Nile, which symbolized both sorrow and the life-giving force of the river.
- In Egyptian cosmology, tears were also tied to the creation myths. Some versions suggest that humans were created from the tears of the sun god **Ra** as he wept over the state of the world.

**"Rem"** can also relate to water in general, which was considered a source of life in Egyptian culture, as the Nile River was the lifeblood of ancient Egypt. The association between water and tears underscores the balance between sorrow and sustenance, where tears (rem) symbolize not just grief but also the renewal and continuation of life.

Additionally, in some Egyptian texts, "rem" has connotations related to compassion or mercy, further linking it to the concept of emotional and spiritual restoration.

The symbolic meaning of "rem" in Egyptian spirituality is deeply tied to the cycles of life, death, and rebirth, reflected in the natural world through the flooding of the Nile and the mythologies of gods like Ra, Isis, and Osiris.
