# Logical Fallacies: Non-Sequitur



---



---

Let's talk about logical fallacies. Explain non-sequitur.

---



---

A non-sequitur is a logical fallacy where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. It's like jumping to a conclusion without any logical connection. For example, if someone says, "She's wearing red shoes, so she must be a good dancer," they're making a non-sequitur because the color of her shoes has nothing to do with her dancing abilities. The term "non-sequitur" is Latin for "it does not follow."

Is Latin a language that was created for the Bible writings or to write the Bible?

---

No, Latin was not created for the Bible writings or to write the Bible. Latin was the language of the Roman Empire and was widely used in government, literature, and daily life long before the Bible was written. The Bible's Old Testament was originally written mainly in Hebrew, with some parts in Aramaic, while the New Testament was originally written in Greek. Latin translations of the Bible, such as the Vulgate, came later to make the scriptures accessible to Latin-speaking Christians.

---

Why was the New Testament written in Greek?

---

The New Testament was written in Greek because, at the time, Greek was the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Roman Empire. This means it was the common language used for trade, communication, and education across many different regions and cultures. Writing in Greek allowed the authors of the New Testament to reach a broad and diverse audience, ensuring that the message of Christianity could spread widely and be understood by many people.

---

Wasn't Greek also the language of the philosophers?

---

Yes, Greek was indeed the language of many philosophers, particularly during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle wrote and taught in Greek. The rich tradition of Greek philosophy and literature significantly influenced the intellectual and cultural environment of the time, which made Greek an ideal language for the New Testament writers to use, as it was associated with education, scholarship, and wide communication.

---

So then the writers of the New Testament were educated Greek speakers, which means that they were Hellenistic and aware of the philosophies of Socrates and others, and these influenced their writings.

---

Yes, many of the New Testament writers were educated and likely familiar with Greek language and culture, including its philosophical traditions. The influence of Hellenistic philosophy can be seen in various aspects of the New Testament. For example, concepts such as logos (the Word) in the Gospel of John reflect philosophical ideas prevalent in Hellenistic thought. Additionally, Paul, who was well-educated and a Roman citizen, often engaged with Greek philosophical ideas in his epistles, using them to communicate with and address the concerns of his largely Greek-speaking audiences. This blending of Jewish religious concepts with Hellenistic philosophical language helped make the message of Christianity more accessible and relatable to the broader, educated public of the Roman Empire.

Explained equivocation.

---

Equivocation is a logical fallacy that occurs when a word or phrase is used with different meanings in different parts of an argument, creating confusion and misleading conclusions. It's essentially using the same term in different senses without clarifying the change in meaning.

For example, consider the statement: "A feather is light. What is light cannot be dark. Therefore, a feather cannot be dark." Here, "light" is used first to mean "not heavy" and then to mean "not dark," which creates a misleading argument because the term "light" has different meanings in each use.

---

So to say that Jesus is the scapegoat is equivocating because, equivocating because a scapegoat is a Jewish ritual in which the goat is not killed but carries away sin. But to say that Jesus is the scapegoat or the lamb that carries away sin and is killed is equivocating. Jesus.

---

Yes, that would be an example of equivocation. The term "scapegoat" refers to the Jewish ritual described in Leviticus, where a goat symbolically carries the sins of the people and is then sent into the wilderness, not killed. If one says Jesus is the "scapegoat," but also refers to Him as the sacrificial "lamb" who is killed, they are using "scapegoat" in a different sense than its original meaning, thus creating a misleading analogy. This shifts the concept of atonement in a way that mixes distinct rituals and their intended purposes, which can confuse the theological point being made.
