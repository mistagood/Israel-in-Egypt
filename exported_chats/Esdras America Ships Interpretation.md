# Esdras America Ships Interpretation

---

What does Esdras  say about people coming to the new land or America on ships?

In **2 Esdras (also known as 4 Ezra)**—a book included in the Apocrypha and recognized in some Christian traditions—there is a passage that has been interpreted by some readers to describe a migration of people to a "new land" across water. This is most commonly found in **2 Esdras 13:40–45**, which speaks of the *Ten Tribes of Israel* being led to a far-off land.

Here is the passage in full:

### 📜 **2 Esdras 13:40–45 (KJV w/ Apocrypha)**

> **40** Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.  
>
> **41** But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a *further country*, where never mankind dwelt,  
>
> **42** That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.  
>
> **43** And they entered into *Euphrates by the narrow places of the river*.  
>
> **44** For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over.  
>
> **45** For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called *Arsareth*.

### 🔍 Interpretation:

- **“Another land”** and **“a further country where never mankind dwelt”** has been interpreted by some as referring to the **Americas**—especially during early European colonial and post-colonial religious movements trying to link Native peoples or certain populations (e.g., some Black Hebrews or indigenous tribes) to the *lost tribes of Israel*.
  
- The phrase **“entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river”** suggests a departure point in the East, while **“a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half”** has led some to theorize a long maritime journey—possibly around Africa or through uncharted waters.

- The name **“Arsareth”** (Hebrew: אַרְצָרֵת? possibly a contraction of *eretz acheret*, "another land") is only mentioned here in all of Scripture and Apocrypha. It is sometimes taken to mean a hidden or remote land, giving rise to theories that it was the **Western Hemisphere**—though this is not a mainstream view in traditional scholarship.

### 🧭 Summary:

**2 Esdras 13:40–45** speaks of the Ten Tribes traveling over water to a distant, uninhabited land called **Arsareth** to keep God's laws in peace. While it does **not explicitly say “ships”**, the implication of **“carried over the waters”** and traveling a long distance has led some interpreters to link this to oceanic travel—possibly even identifying it with America. However, this is **interpretive and not a literal mention of ships or the name “America.”**

Let me know if you'd like to examine the Hebrew roots of *Arsareth* or explore early commentary or usage of this passage in colonial or Black Hebrew traditions.

Where does it talk about in the Bible about the trade that was happening and the three years journey that it took? I think it was maybe Solomon or somebody was talking about getting stuff from a foreign land and it took a year and a half. I think this relates to it.

You're absolutely right to connect the **three-year trade voyages** with **Solomon's maritime expeditions**—this is directly mentioned in the Bible and is often linked with the idea of long-distance sea trade to foreign lands, possibly including the Americas or distant parts of Africa or India.

Here are the relevant passages:

---

### 📜 **1 Kings 10:22 (KJV)**

> **"For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."**

---

### 📜 **2 Chronicles 9:21 (KJV)**

> **"For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."**

---

### 🔍 Key Points:

- **“Navy of Tarshish” (or Tharshish)**: This refers to Solomon’s fleet that worked in partnership with **Hiram, King of Tyre**, who provided Phoenician sailors. Tarshish is debated in scholarship—it could refer to **southern Spain (Tartessos)**, **East Africa**, or **India**, depending on interpretation.

- **“Every three years once”**: This phrase is critical—it implies a **round trip of three years** from Israel to the foreign land and back, consistent with very long-distance oceanic travel, possibly around the Horn of Africa or further.

- The **cargo**—*gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks*—indicates trade with tropical or sub-tropical regions with rich biodiversity and mineral wealth. These goods are not native to Israel or its immediate neighbors.

### ✨ Connection to 2 Esdras:

When 2 Esdras 13:45 says the ten tribes went to a land “**a year and a half journey**,” it implies a **one-way trip**, while Solomon’s fleet had **three-year round trips**. So yes, this could be interpreted as a related pattern:

- **1.5 years there** (Esdras),
- **3 years there and back** (Solomon).

This has led some researchers—especially among Hebrew Israelite and Afrocentric scholars—to propose that the same route used by Solomon’s ships may have later been followed by the ten tribes when they went to "Arsareth."

---

### ⛵ Summary:

- **Solomon’s navy** took **3 years round trip** to gather exotic goods—gold, ivory, apes, and peacocks—from distant lands (1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chronicles 9:21).
- **2 Esdras 13:45** says it took **1.5 years** to reach Arsareth, a land where the ten tribes went to live in isolation.
- Some connect the two, suggesting that **both refer to faraway lands**—possibly even the Americas or southern hemispheric regions reachable by ship.
