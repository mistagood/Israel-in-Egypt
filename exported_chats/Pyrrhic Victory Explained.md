Yes, a Pyrrhic victory refers to a situation in which someone wins a battle or achieves a goal but at such a devastating cost that the outcome is tantamount to defeat. The term originates from King Pyrrhus of Epirus, who fought against the Romans in 280–279 BCE. Although he won battles at Heraclea and Asculum, his army suffered such heavy losses that he reportedly said, "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined."

In modern usage, it symbolizes any achievement or success that comes with excessive or unsustainable costs, whether in terms of resources, reputation, or relationships, rendering the victory hollow or counterproductive.
