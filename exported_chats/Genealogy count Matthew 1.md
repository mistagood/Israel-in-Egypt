Let’s stay inside the text and just do the math.

---

## 1. List and count every name in Matthew 1

From **Matthew 1:1–16**, the genealogy (in order) is:

**Block 1 – Abraham to David (v. 2–6)**  
1. Abraham  
2. Isaac  
3. Jacob  
4. Judah  
5. Perez  
6. Hezron  
7. Ram  
8. Amminadab  
9. Nahshon  
10. Salmon  
11. Boaz  
12. Obed  
13. Jesse  
14. David  

That’s **14 names**. This matches Matthew 1:17:  
> “from Abraham to David are fourteen generations…”

---

**Block 2 – David to the deportation (v. 6–11)**  

Continuing the numbering:

15. Solomon  
16. Rehoboam  
17. Abijah  
18. Asa  
19. Jehoshaphat  
20. Joram  
21. Uzziah (Azariah)  
22. Jotham  
23. Ahaz  
24. Hezekiah  
25. Manasseh  
26. Amon  
27. Josiah  
28. Jechoniah (and his brothers) – “at the time of the deportation to Babylon”

Now we count generations the way **Matthew describes them** in v.17:

> “from David **until the deportation to Babylon** are fourteen generations…”

If you count **from David to Josiah** (not including Jechoniah), you get:

- David = #14 (from the first list)  
- Josiah = #27  

27 − 14 + 1 = **14 generations**

So the middle block in Matthew’s own scheme is:

- **David → Solomon → … → Josiah** = 14 generations  
- Then **“the deportation to Babylon”** happens in the days of Josiah’s son **Jechoniah** (v.11).

So in **strict name count**, Abraham → Jechoniah is 28 names, but Matthew’s **“14 + 14”** is:

- Block 1: Abraham to David (1–14)  
- Block 2: David to Josiah (14–27, David counted again as starting point)

---

**Block 3 – From the deportation to Christ (v. 12–16)**  

After the deportation, Matthew lists:

29. Shealtiel  
30. Zerubbabel  
31. Abiud  
32. Eliakim  
33. Azor  
34. Zadok  
35. Achim  
36. Eliud  
37. Eleazar  
38. Matthan  
39. Jacob  
40. Joseph (husband of Mary)  
41. Jesus (called Christ)

But look carefully at v.12:

> “After the deportation to Babylon, **Jechoniah** fathered Shealtiel…”

So for Matthew’s 3rd block, the “from the deportation to Christ” count runs:

- Start: **Jechoniah** (the deportation generation)  
- End: **Jesus**

Count them:

1. Jechoniah  
2. Shealtiel  
3. Zerubbabel  
4. Abiud  
5. Eliakim  
6. Azor  
7. Zadok  
8. Achim  
9. Eliud  
10. Eleazar  
11. Matthan  
12. Jacob  
13. Joseph  
14. Jesus  

That’s **14 generations** from “the deportation” (Jechoniah) to Christ.

So:

- **Block 1:** Abraham → David = 14  
- **Block 2:** David → Josiah (deportation era) = 14  
- **Block 3:** Jechoniah (deportation) → Jesus = 14  

Total **persons** from Abraham to Jesus in the list = **41**.  
Total “generation slots” Matthew is counting in his 14–14–14 formula = **42**, because:

- David is counted in both the **first** and **second** sets (as the end of one and the start of another), and  
- The **deportation** is a turning-point counted with Josiah on one side and Jechoniah on the other.

That’s the internal reconciliation of the math **within Matthew**.

---

## 2. Compare with the Old Testament genealogy (who’s missing)

Now, line this up with **1 Chronicles 3:10–16**, which gives the Davidic line down to the exile:

From David to the exile in **1 Chronicles 3** you get:

- David  
- Solomon  
- Rehoboam  
- Abijah  
- Asa  
- Jehoshaphat  
- Joram  
- **Ahaziah**  
- **Joash**  
- **Amaziah**  
- Azariah (Uzziah)  
- Jotham  
- Ahaz  
- Hezekiah  
- Manasseh  
- Amon  
- Josiah  
- **Jehoiakim**  
- Jeconiah (Jechoniah) and his brothers  

Compared to that, **Matthew 1** deliberately *skips*:

- Ahaziah  
- Joash  
- Amaziah  
- Jehoiakim  

So instead of listing **18** generations from David to Jechoniah (as Chronicles does), Matthew strips it down to **14** by **omitting four kings** in the middle (three between Joram and Uzziah, one between Josiah and Jechoniah).

This is not a scribal error; this is how biblical genealogies often work:

- They **compress** lines by skipping intermediate ancestors.  
- “Father of” can mean **ancestor of / from the line of**, not necessarily direct biological father in every step (you see the same pattern in other biblical genealogies).

Matthew is shaping the list into a **numerical pattern** (three blocks of 14) rather than giving an exhaustive civil registry.

---

## 3. Final reconciliation in one view

**Raw headcount in Matthew 1:**

- Names from Abraham → Jesus: **41 individuals**.  

**Matthew’s own summary (Matthew 1:17):**

1. From **Abraham to David** = 14 generations  
   - (Abraham→David, inclusive)

2. From **David to the deportation to Babylon** = 14 generations  
   - (David→Josiah, inclusive; deportation happens in Jechoniah’s time)

3. From **the deportation to Babylon to Christ** = 14 generations  
   - (Jechoniah→Jesus, inclusive)

**Mechanics of the 14–14–14 scheme:**

- **David** is counted in both the first and second sets (shared boundary).  
- The **deportation** is marked by Josiah on one side and Jechoniah on the other.  
- Four kings from the Old Testament record are **omitted** to force the middle block down to 14 names.

So the genealogy in Matthew 1 is:

- Not a “mistake” in counting.  
- A **deliberately compressed, stylized genealogy**, mathematically arranged into **three symbolic sets of fourteen**, using standard Hebrew practice of skipping some links in the chain.

I'm not asking for the justification, that's what I mean. I'm just asking how many names are there and how many generations does he say there are.

---



---

Here is the clean, stripped-down answer with **no justification**, only the raw numbers exactly as the text gives them.

---

# **1. How many names appear in Matthew 1:1–16?**

Counting every individual named from **Abraham to Jesus**, you get:

**41 names total.**

(Listed without commentary)

1. Abraham  
2. Isaac  
3. Jacob  
4. Judah  
5. Perez  
6. Hezron  
7. Ram  
8. Amminadab  
9. Nahshon  
10. Salmon  
11. Boaz  
12. Obed  
13. Jesse  
14. David  
15. Solomon  
16. Rehoboam  
17. Abijah  
18. Asa  
19. Jehoshaphat  
20. Joram  
21. Uzziah  
22. Jotham  
23. Ahaz  
24. Hezekiah  
25. Manasseh  
26. Amon  
27. Josiah  
28. Jechoniah  
29. Shealtiel  
30. Zerubbabel  
31. Abiud  
32. Eliakim  
33. Azor  
34. Zadok  
35. Achim  
36. Eliud  
37. Eleazar  
38. Matthan  
39. Jacob  
40. Joseph  
41. Jesus

---

# **2. How many generations does Matthew say there are? (Matthew 1:17)**

Matthew **states** the following counts:

1. **From Abraham to David = 14 generations**  
2. **From David to the deportation to Babylon = 14 generations**  
3. **From the deportation to Babylon to Christ = 14 generations**

So the stated count is:

**14 + 14 + 14 = 42 “generations.”**

---

# **Summary**

- **Actual names listed:** **41**  
- **Generations Matthew claims:** **42**

That’s the clean reconciliation of what is *written* versus what is *stated*.

---

# **Final Counts**
• **Direct Named Individuals:** ~120  
• All are tied to Judah’s line exactly as 1 Chronicles 2 presents them.

If you want, I can also:

• extract **only the “sons”**,  
• extract **only Hezron’s line**,  
• extract **only the line leading to David**,  
• extract **only Hur’s line tied to Bethlehem**,  
• or reconcile these with Genesis 38.
