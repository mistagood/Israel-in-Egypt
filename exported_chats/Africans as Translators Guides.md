# Africans as Translators Guides



---

In the early days of European settlers in the Americas, did Africans act as translators and guides to Europeans for when they wanted to communicate with the Indians?

Yes, there is evidence suggesting that some Africans, particularly those who had previously been exposed to European and indigenous cultures through trade or captivity, acted as translators and guides for Europeans in their interactions with indigenous peoples. This often occurred in contexts where Africans had been enslaved or had traveled across different regions, giving them knowledge of multiple languages, including indigenous dialects and European tongues.

One notable example is the case of Estebanico (also known as Estevanico), an African man who was part of the Spanish expedition led by Pánfilo de Narváez in the early 16th century. Estebanico, originally from Morocco, became one of the first Africans to explore what is now the southern United States and Mexico. He was highly valued by his Spanish captors for his ability to communicate with indigenous peoples and acted as an intermediary between the Spanish and various Native American tribes.

In other cases, enslaved Africans who escaped or were traded among indigenous groups might have acquired language skills that enabled them to serve as translators or cultural brokers between Europeans and Native Americans. This role of Africans as intermediaries or translators highlights the complex relationships between European colonizers, indigenous populations, and Africans in early colonial America.

However, this practice wasn't widespread, as the dominant role of intermediaries and translators was often held by mixed-race individuals (Mestizos) or Europeans who learned indigenous languages, but the involvement of Africans in these roles did occur in certain regions and circumstances.
