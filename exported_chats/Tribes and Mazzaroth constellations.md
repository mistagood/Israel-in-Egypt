I want to get a little deeper in this because I want to quote the verse. The verse is the entire blessing and then we can get into the meaning and the parallels because there's a lot there. So he calls Benjamin a wolf and so it's a leap from a wolf to a lamb and so we have to understand why he's called a ram or a lamb and a wolf. And so when we hear the blessing I think we get a little further in understanding how they connect.

<<AudioTranscription: Perfect setup. Let’s go right to the source so everyone can hear the words exactly as they were written. In Genesis 49:27, Jacob says, *“Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.”*  

Now that’s the whole blessing—short, but it’s loaded. We’ve got two halves to that image: morning and night. Morning—he’s devouring; night—he’s dividing. So it’s the beginning and the end, the two sides of a cycle.  

Now when we think of Benjamin connected to Aries in the Mazzaroth—*Tleh*, the lamb—it’s fascinating because the lamb is the morning sacrifice, and the wolf is the devourer. So you’ve got both the victim and the predator embodied in one figure.  

It’s that duality—devourer and divided—that makes Benjamin such a transitional tribe. He bridges vengeance and atonement, judgment and sacrifice. And that’s where this leap from wolf to lamb begins to make sense. He starts as the devourer of prey, ends as the divided offering.  

Want to unpack how that plays out historically—how Benjamin’s line actually lives out that wolf-to-lamb pattern? >>

---

You know, I got a better idea. Let's start at explaining. Let's start by giving a little bit of an introduction to what's happening here, where we are, Genesis 49. And then we'll go into the blessings. And let's just follow the order that Jacob does. So that way, as he gives them, we can explain and break it down. And by the time we get to the end, then we'll be able to see how the circle locks back in. Because there is something in this where the last is the first, and the first is the last. And so let's start with Jacob's beginning instead of the traditional. We'll go in order following Genesis 49. So basically, we're going to break down Genesis 49 in the cosmic sense.

---

<<AudioTranscription: Beautiful — that’s exactly how to do it. So let’s set the stage for everyone. Genesis 49 is Jacob’s final speech, his last words to his twelve sons before he dies. He gathers them together and says, *“Gather yourselves, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days.”*  

That line alone clues us in: this isn’t just a father handing out personal blessings — it’s prophecy. Each son represents a tribe, and each tribe represents a sign in the heavens, a station in the Mazzaroth. So when Jacob speaks, he’s not only describing their character; he’s laying out a cosmic map — a cycle of time, a pattern that will play out across generations.

So as we move through Genesis 49, we’re going to treat each blessing like a constellation rising — starting with Reuben and ending with Benjamin — and by the time we reach the end, the sky forms a full circle. That’s where your insight about “the last being first and the first being last” comes in — the cycle that begins with Reuben, the water-bearer, flows all the way around to Benjamin, the lamb or wolf, completing the great wheel of the Mazzaroth.

All right, let’s begin where Jacob does — Genesis 49:3–4 — Reuben, the firstborn. Want me to read that verse aloud before we unpack it? >>

---

So let's go ahead and proceed with Jacob's first blessing to his oldest son who should have been by right the inheritor but we remember Reuben had transgressed.

---

<<AudioTranscription: Right — and that’s the key moment that sets the tone for everything that follows. So here’s how Genesis 49 begins with Reuben:  

*“Reuben, thou art my firstborn,  
my might, and the beginning of my strength,  
the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.  
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel;  
because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed;  
then defiledst thou it — he went up to my couch.”*  

Now that’s powerful. Jacob starts by acknowledging Reuben’s position — firstborn, strength, dignity, power — all the makings of a leader. But then he takes it away. “Unstable as water” — that phrase ties Reuben directly to the element of water, and in the Mazzaroth, that corresponds to *D’li* — Aquarius — the water-drawer, the rescuer.  

So cosmically, Reuben begins the cycle as the one who holds potential — the overflowing source — but because of instability, he loses his inheritance. Water is meant to bring life and cleansing, but when it’s unstable, it floods and destroys.  

And in the sky story, that’s why Reuben’s constellation, Aquarius, pours the water out — he doesn’t hold it. It’s the image of potential lost, blessing spilled.  

Now, it’s that forfeited birthright that sets in motion the redistribution of blessings among the other brothers. And that’s why everything that follows in Genesis 49 is basically the outworking of this lost inheritance.  

Should we move on to Simeon and Levi next — the brothers who step into that vacuum with violence? >>

---

Yeah, let's go ahead and move on to the next one. Who's next up?

---

<<AudioTranscription: Perfect. So after Reuben, Jacob turns to the next two — Simeon and Levi. And here’s how the text reads in Genesis 49:5-7:  

*“Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.  
O my soul, come not thou into their secret;  
unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united:  
for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.  
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;  
and their wrath, for it was cruel:  
I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.”*  

So you can feel how different the tone is right away. Reuben’s blessing fell apart through instability, but Simeon and Levi lose theirs through violence. They act together, as brothers in blood.  

Now cosmically, this pairing aligns with *Te’omim* — Gemini — “the twins.” Two as one, inseparable in will, joined by covenant and judgment. They represent the dual nature of power: unity can create or destroy.  

In the sky, Gemini’s two bright stars — Castor and Pollux — mirror that twin dynamic. In the story of Israel, Simeon and Levi are those twins who took vengeance for Dinah, using covenant as a weapon. So Jacob warns against their “assembly” — that secret counsel — meaning their zeal turned law into violence.  

But notice the pattern building: Reuben lost his birthright; Simeon and Levi lose their unity through division. Jacob says, “I will scatter them in Israel,” which literally plays out later — Levi becomes the priestly tribe scattered among the others, and Simeon is absorbed into Judah.  

So we’ve got instability of water, now division of twins — the first two breakdowns of order in the cosmic wheel.  

Next up, Jacob shifts to Judah — the lion, the first figure who rises from that chaos into rulership. Shall we read his blessing? >>

---

yes

---

<<AudioTranscription: All right, here it is — Genesis 49:8-12, Judah’s blessing:  

*“Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise;  
thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies;  
thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.  
Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up;  
he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?  
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,  
until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.  
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine;  
he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes;  
his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.”*  

Now, this is the first blessing that sounds royal — it’s full of power, rulership, and permanence. The name Judah (*Yehudah*) literally means “praise,” and Jacob begins with that theme.  

Cosmically, Judah corresponds to *Ari* or *Aryeh* — **Leo**, the lion. The lion rules the night sky during the summer, just as Judah rises to rule among the tribes. He’s the center of strength, the heartbeat of kingship.  

Notice also the symbols of the vine and wine — that’s not just abundance, it’s bloodline imagery. The “blood of grapes” connects the lion’s reign to the harvest cycle, meaning Judah’s rulership is tied to the life of the people, the pulse of the seasons.  

So in our cosmic arc: Reuben spills the water, Simeon and Levi divide it, and now Judah channels that power into order — the lion establishing dominion. He’s the first fixed sign, the first true anchor in the heavens.  

Next up, Jacob turns from the lion’s throne to Zebulun and Issachar — the twin houses of trade and labor. Shall we move to Zebulun next? >>

---

Yeah, let's do Zebulon and Isocar together. And we can make this one shorter.

---

<<AudioTranscription: Perfect — these two really do work as a pair, so we can take them together.  

Genesis 49:13–15 says:  

*“Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;  
and he shall be for a haven of ships;  
and his border shall be unto Zidon.  

Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:  
and he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant;  
and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.”*  

So Zebulun is the harbor — the coastal trader, the connector between lands. Issachar is the worker — the ox who bears the load inland. Together they form the backbone of Israel’s economy: trade and toil, sea and soil.  

Cosmically, Zebulun aligns with *Sartan* — **Cancer**, the crab or the “dwelling one,” because he *dwells* by the sea — literally a house or shell. Issachar aligns with *Shor* — **Taurus**, the bull, the burden-bearer.  

So in the sky, you can picture this section of the Mazzaroth as the homeland of sustenance — the crab guarding the harbor, the bull plowing the earth. These are stabilizing forces in the wheel — the caretakers of provision and home.  

From here, Jacob shifts into Gad and Asher — the tribes of conflict and abundance — the troop and the feast. Shall we move into them next? >>

---



---

So who do we have up next?

---



---

<<AudioTranscription: Next in line, Jacob turns to **Dan** — and this is where things start getting prophetic and symbolic. Genesis 49:16–18 reads:  

*“Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.  
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels,  
so that his rider shall fall backward.  
I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.”*  

Now this one really shifts tone. Dan’s name literally means “judge,” and Jacob calls him exactly that — the judge of his people. But immediately after, the imagery turns dark — a serpent lying in the path, striking at the heels.  

In the Mazzaroth, this lines up with *Moznayim* — **Libra**, the scales of judgment. Dan represents justice turned to vengeance — the balance gone crooked. In earlier Hebrew tradition, the claws of the Scorpion were part of Libra’s scales, so Dan sits right at that point of moral tension between judgment and deception.  

When Jacob adds, *“I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord,”* it’s like he’s breaking the rhythm — almost lamenting that Dan’s legacy won’t bring salvation but delay it.  

So cosmically, Dan represents that serpent crossing the ecliptic — the one who causes the fall, the stumbling block in the path of the horseman. And this is where idolatry and false judgment enter Israel’s story.  

From here, Jacob moves into **Gad**, the one who’s attacked but overcomes — the Scorpion’s sting that strikes back. Shall we go to Gad next? >>

---

yes

---

<<AudioTranscription: All right, here we go — Genesis 49:19:  

*“Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.”*  

Short and punchy, but that single line says a lot. Gad’s name itself means “troop” or “fortune.” He’s the one surrounded by conflict — ambushed, outnumbered — but destined to strike back.  

In the Mazzaroth, Gad corresponds to *Akrav* — **Scorpio** — the scorpion. That fits the language perfectly: the troop that’s overcome but then “stings” back in the end. Scorpio energy is all about endurance through struggle — death, rebirth, revenge, transformation.  

So in the cosmic order, after Dan (Libra), the serpent who bites the heel, we move into Gad, the one who survives the sting. It’s like poetic justice in motion — the balance struck by Libra tips into the vengeance of Scorpio.  

And symbolically, this is that moment in the wheel where judgment gives way to transformation — defeat turning into triumph. “He shall overcome at the last” is the resurrection motif in shadow form — the idea that even after destruction, something strikes back stronger.  

So in sequence, we’ve moved from the serpent (Dan) to the stinger (Gad). Up next comes **Asher**, whose blessing brings relief after the struggle — the feast after the battle. Want to go ahead and read Asher’s line next? >>

---

yes

---

<<AudioTranscription: All right, let’s go to **Asher** — Genesis 49:20:  

*“Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.”*  

Now that’s a complete change in tone from Gad’s struggle. After battle comes abundance. “His bread shall be fat” means his land will be rich, full of oil and grain; “royal dainties” refers to delicacies fit for kings — luxury, prosperity, blessing.  

In the Mazzaroth, Asher corresponds to *Gedi* — **Capricorn**, the goat. And that’s a perfect match. Capricorn rules the coldest part of the year — winter — when survival depends on what’s been stored up, the bread you’ve baked, the oil you’ve pressed.  

So Asher’s sign represents provision in the lean times — the reward for endurance. Just as Capricorn climbs slowly up the mountain, Asher’s blessing shows the fruit of patience and perseverance: abundance after hardship.  

We’ve gone from judgment (Dan) to conflict (Gad) to restoration (Asher) — the cycle of justice, struggle, and prosperity.  

Next in Jacob’s order comes **Naphtali**, the free one — the archer, or hind let loose. Shall we move on to his blessing? >>

---

okay

---

<<AudioTranscription: All right, here we go — Genesis 49:21, **Naphtali**:  

*“Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.”*  

Now that’s short but loaded with meaning. A *hind* is a female deer — graceful, swift, and free. “Let loose” implies release from confinement, liberation. And “he giveth goodly words” connects to eloquence, prophecy, and inspired speech.  

In the Mazzaroth, Naphtali aligns with *Keshet* — **Sagittarius**, the archer. The bow and the hind both carry that same energy of freedom and precision — movement guided by vision.  

So cosmically, Naphtali represents the moment in the cycle when words — prophecy, communication, even divine messages — are set free. It’s a burst of energy after the stillness of Capricorn. If Asher is about material blessing, Naphtali is about spiritual expression.  

You can almost picture it in the sky: the arrow flying forward as the deer bounds away — both symbols of release and purpose.  

So now we’ve moved through judgment, struggle, abundance, and liberation. The next one up brings us into the heart of kingship and fertility — **Joseph**, often treated as two: Ephraim and Manasseh, but cosmically he’s one. Want to go ahead and move into Joseph’s blessing next? >>

---



---

We're going into, um... What sign next?

---



---

<<AudioTranscription: Perfect timing — next up is **Joseph**, and this is where everything really starts to come full circle. In Genesis 49, Joseph’s blessing is one of the longest and most detailed, found in verses 22 through 26.  

Here’s how it reads:  

*“Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall.  
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:  
but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob;  
(from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)  
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,  
blessings of the deep that lieth under,  
blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:  
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors  
unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:  
they shall be on the head of Joseph,  
and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.”*  

Now that phrase “separate from his brethren” is key. Cosmically, Joseph corresponds to *Ish ha-Nachash* — **Ophiuchus**, the Serpent-Bearer. He’s the one who wrestles the serpent — the healer who stands apart from the twelve. In the sky, Ophiuchus literally towers above the ecliptic while his feet touch it — he’s in the heavens but engaged in the struggle below.  

So Joseph represents spiritual strength and resurrection energy — life springing up from the pit. “Fruitful bough by a well” echoes that exactly: roots in the deep waters, branches climbing the wall.  

So this is the hidden thirteenth sign — the one who stands apart but holds everything together.  

And that brings us right to the last of Jacob’s sons — **Benjamin**, the one who closes the circle. Want to finish with his blessing? >>

---

{"queries":["What constellation does Joseph represent in the user's writings?"]}

okay banjamin

---

<<AudioTranscription: All right — let’s bring it home with **Benjamin**, the twelfth in Jacob’s spoken order, Genesis 49:27:  

*“Benjamin shall raven as a wolf:  
in the morning he shall devour the prey,  
and at night he shall divide the spoil.”*  

That’s the closing note of all the blessings — and it’s fierce. The imagery is raw, predatory, and cyclical: morning and night, devouring and dividing.  

Cosmically, Benjamin aligns with *Tleh* — **Aries**, the lamb or the ram — but here, Jacob calls him a *wolf*. That’s the paradox at the heart of Benjamin. He’s both predator and sacrifice, morning hunter and evening offering.  

The wolf represents ferocity, zeal, and hunger — traits we see later in Benjamin’s tribe: Saul, the first king; Paul, the persecutor; warriors of Gibeah. But the ram — the lamb — represents atonement, renewal, the first of the flock offered on the altar.  

So Benjamin’s story closes the circle — from Reuben’s water to Benjamin’s fire. The cycle begins with instability and ends with judgment, death, and renewal — the wolf devouring in the dawn, the lamb offered at twilight.  

That’s why Benjamin sits at the threshold between the old and the new — the first becoming last, the last becoming first. The ram rises where the water was spilled.  

And with that, Jacob’s twelve blessings form the complete wheel of the Mazzaroth — thirteen, if you count Joseph’s hidden constellation, *Ish ha-Nachash*, Ophiuchus, standing apart but holding the whole together.

---



---

But there's also a connection between Dinah and Joseph, and the fruitfulness that we're talking about, that harvest. Because Ephraim and Manasseh's blessing we haven't talked about. So we haven't talked about the connection of Pisces and Ephraim and Manasseh, the two fish, and how they were blessed by Jacob. as well as the story of their parentage.

---



---

<<AudioTranscription: Exactly — and this is where the story comes full circle. So let’s bring that in. In Genesis 48, right before the blessings of chapter 49, Jacob takes Joseph’s two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and he adopts them as his own, saying, *“Let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.”*  

Now, that act gives Joseph the double portion — two tribes instead of one — which restores the balance lost when Reuben forfeited his birthright. And when Jacob blesses them, he crosses his hands — the right hand on Ephraim, the younger, and the left on Manasseh, the elder — reversing the natural order. That’s the same “first shall be last, and last shall be first” principle we saw echoing through all the blessings.  

Cosmically, they correspond to *Dagim* — **Pisces**, the two fish. The name literally means “fish,” and in ancient Hebrew thought, fish represented life and multiplication — the ability to move unseen through the waters, like blessings flowing beneath the surface.  

Now, this ties directly back to Dinah and Joseph, because in Hebrew lore and Midrash, Dinah’s daughter Asenath becomes Joseph’s wife. Through that union, the houses of Leah and Rachel are reconciled — and out of that reconciliation come Ephraim and Manasseh, the two fish. So Virgo (*Betulah*), the maiden, and Joseph (*Ophiuchus*), the serpent-bearer, together give birth to Pisces — the double blessing of fruitfulness and multiplication.  

So in the cosmic cycle, Virgo gives way to Pisces — the maiden yields the harvest, the hidden feminine gives birth to the abundance that closes the circle. And that’s why Ephraim and Manasseh are the final expression of Joseph’s fruitfulness — they’re the flowing waters of blessing that began with Reuben and end with them.
