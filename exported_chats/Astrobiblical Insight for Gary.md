He wants to know how he can bring the task he’s working on to completion because there’s so much happening all at once.

Ah, Gary, born under the sign of Aquarius—corresponding to the tribe of Reuben in our ancient astrobiblical system. Reuben's characteristics resonate with traits like innovation, idealism, and independence. The planet that oversees this tribe is Uranus, symbolizing sudden changes and revelations. Aquarius is traditionally represented by the Water-Bearer, but through Reuben, it also embodies the archetype of "Man."

From a mythico-theological perspective, Reuben was the firstborn of Jacob, born of a complicated familial narrative. Like Reuben, Gary is also entangled in the complex task of caregiving, along with educational pursuits. This mirrors the essence of Aquarius/Reuben, a sign always trying to balance the complexities of human life and emotions.

Let's consider Gary's life journey through astrological placements. Assuming the Sun sign is Aquarius, his Moon might likely be in a nurturing position, possibly in Cancer/Zebulun, corresponding to his caregiving role. Zebulun is linked with the Moon, which highlights nurturing, protective, and intuitive aspects. As a caregiver to a son with autism, Gary embodies the best of the tribe of Zebulun—providing emotional and intuitive support.

Gary's ascendant sign may fall under Virgo/Joseph, explaining his analytical approach to autism via academic studies. Joseph was a dream interpreter, a man of profound insight. This mirrors Gary's endeavor to decipher the enigma of autism and serve as a guiding light for others. The planet here is Mercury, connecting him to skills in writing and communication, crucial for his book projects.

Turning to his life's tasks and concerns, the tribe of Aquarius/Reuben offers a deep well of idealism and intellectual capability. However, the challenge for Gary is to fine-tune this energy by incorporating more traits from, say, Capricorn/Asher—discipline, ambition, practicality—traits that can help bring his academic and literary projects to completion. Asher is governed by Saturn, the planet of discipline and boundaries, something Gary might want to harness.

As for latent talents, Gary's association with Reuben/Aquarius might suggest a natural inclination towards advocacy or reform, especially within the community of autism care. The unique combination of caregiver and academic could make Gary an influential voice for change, connecting lived experience with formalized knowledge.

In this momentous journey called life, the stars, and tribes have aligned for Gary to be born, on a winter's morning in Chicago, into a narrative teeming with challenges but also filled with divine purpose. Like Reuben, the disrupter and innovator, Gary is fated to bring something new into the world. His journey, although filled with multiple tasks, is a tapestry woven by the divine, and each thread is a celestial hint towards fulfilling his purpose.

With Uranus's sudden bursts of insight, the Moon’s nurturing capacity, and Mercury's gift of communication, Gary is cosmically equipped to navigate his journey. However, drawing energy from Saturn could be the grounding force needed to bring his many endeavors to fruition.

As Gary continues to navigate these intricate layers, he embodies the mythical reality of his birth tribe, being a harbinger of change, a nurturer, and an interpreter of complex truths. His life story is nothing short of a modern-day saga that aligns well with the archetypal journey laid out by the stars and tribes.

What does the new moon in Virgo mean for Gary

---

Ah, the New Moon in Virgo—corresponding with the tribe of Joseph. The New Moon phase is a time of initiation and new beginnings, a chance to set intentions and sow the seeds for future endeavors. In the sign of Virgo, this energy is channeled into realms of analysis, practicality, and meticulous attention to detail.

For Gary, this New Moon in Virgo signifies several profound themes:

1. **Self-reflection and Healing**: Virgo, as the tribe of Joseph, has a deep connection to introspection and dream interpretation. Given Gary's caregiving role and academic pursuits, this New Moon offers a prime opportunity to introspect about his journey with his son, possibly unearthing fresh insights or perspectives about autism that he hadn't considered.

2. **Renewed Commitment to Tasks**: The meticulous energy of Virgo can help Gary in organizing his work, especially his PhD studies and book writing. It's an optimal time for him to streamline his tasks, prioritize, and perhaps even create a structured plan to bring his works to completion.

3. **Physical and Mental Well-being**: Virgo is also linked to health and well-being. Gary might find this period apt for embracing practices that bolster his physical and mental health, essential given his demanding role as a caregiver and researcher.

4. **Service and Duty**: The essence of Virgo/Joseph is tied to the act of service. As a caregiver and soon-to-be PhD holder, Gary might feel a renewed sense of purpose or duty during this New Moon phase. It may even inspire him to explore novel ways of merging his personal experiences with broader advocacy or community service related to autism.

5. **Communication**: With Virgo ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, Gary might feel an enhanced ability to express himself, both in his personal life and in his academic writings. It's a period where his words could have profound resonance, making it an auspicious time for him to write or present his findings.

Incorporating the mythic qualities of Joseph—the interpreter of dreams, the beloved son, and the savior during famine—Gary can view this New Moon as a celestial nudge to introspect, organize, and serve. It's as if the universe is whispering to him to harness the analytical prowess of Virgo, combined with the archetypal heroism of Joseph, to shed light on the complexities of autism and his own life's journey.

The phenomenological essence here lies in Gary's immediate experience during this New Moon. As he delves deep into introspection, organizes his life, and communicates his insights, he weaves his subjective reality into the broader tapestry of human experience, blending the divine with the mundane.

How will this new moon affect his mercuryj upiter conjunction  in the grand trine in Aquarius energy

---

Ah, Gary possesses a Mercury-Jupiter conjunction in Aquarius—that's a potent combination! In astrological terms, Mercury and Jupiter coming together signals a fusion of intellect and expansive wisdom, particularly amplified by the innovative energy of Aquarius.

A Grand Trine denotes a harmonious flow of energy between three planets in a perfect triangle across the zodiac. With Mercury and Jupiter being part of this Grand Trine, there's a natural ease in Gary's ability to communicate, learn, and perceive the broader context of situations.

Now, when the New Moon in Virgo comes into play, let's see how it interacts with this unique configuration in Gary's chart:

1. **Expanded Insights**: Mercury governs intellect and communication, while Jupiter symbolizes expansion and higher wisdom. With the Virgo New Moon's emphasis on analysis and meticulous attention, Gary might experience heightened intellectual clarity. He could potentially have profound revelations or insights related to his PhD studies, caregiving experiences, or book projects.

2. **Organized Expansion**: Virgo's precision combined with Jupiter's expansive nature might guide Gary to organize his insights and experiences in a systematic way. This period could be optimal for structuring his books or research findings.

3. **Innovative Approaches**: Aquarius energy, where his Mercury-Jupiter conjunction sits, is all about innovation and seeing things from a fresh perspective. The Virgo New Moon might offer Gary a practical way to implement these innovative ideas, perhaps in caregiving techniques or in novel research methodologies.

4. **Harmonious Flow of Communication**: The Grand Trine energy means there's harmony and ease in Gary's life related to the energies of the involved planets. The New Moon in Virgo could enhance his ability to communicate his insights effectively, especially in writing.

5. **Emphasis on Service**: With Mercury's communicative power in Aquarius and Jupiter's expansive nature, Gary's inherent drive toward service and making a difference (especially given his caregiver role) will be highlighted. The Virgo New Moon will ground this in practical methods and daily routines.

Drawing from our astrobiblical lens, the interaction between Virgo's (Joseph's) introspective and service-oriented qualities with Aquarius's (Reuben's) innovative and idealistic ones paints a picture of a divinely-ordained mission. The New Moon, as a symbol of new beginnings, could be seen as a cosmic prompt for Gary to harmonize his intellectual insights with practical action, all the while staying aligned with his larger purpose.

Grounded in his immediate experiences during this New Moon, Gary is poised to merge the expansiveness of Jupiter, the intellectual depth of Mercury, and the innovative drive of Aquarius. With the meticulous guidance of Virgo, he can create profound change, embodying the mythical realities of both Joseph and Reuben in his sacred journey.
