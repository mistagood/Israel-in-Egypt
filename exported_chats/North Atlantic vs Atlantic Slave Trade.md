The terms "North Atlantic Slave Trade" and "Atlantic Slave Trade" are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle distinctions in their usage.

**Atlantic Slave Trade**: This term broadly refers to the entire system of human trafficking that took place across the Atlantic Ocean from the 16th to the 19th century. It encompassed all regions involved in the transatlantic exchange, including the export of African slaves primarily to the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean. The Atlantic Slave Trade includes routes from the West African coast to South America, the Caribbean, and North America.

**North Atlantic Slave Trade**: While not a widely recognized separate term, it could be interpreted as referring specifically to the routes within the Atlantic system that connected West Africa with Northern regions, particularly the U.S. and Canadian colonies or the British-controlled North Atlantic territories. This would emphasize the trade that impacted the northern part of the Americas, as opposed to focusing on the southern regions like Brazil or the Caribbean islands.

In historical discourse, the "Atlantic Slave Trade" is the standard term that captures the entire scope of the transatlantic slave system, while "North Atlantic" may specify geographic regions within that broader trade, but it is not commonly distinguished as a separate term. If you’ve come across the distinction, it might reflect a regional focus on the destinations of enslaved Africans in the northern colonies rather than the broader trade that included the southern Americas and Caribbean.
