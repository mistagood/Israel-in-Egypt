22 The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,"   is this the same Korah from the rebellion?

Good question. The Korah in **1 Chronicles 6:22–23** (“The sons of Kohath: Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son…”) is **not the same Korah** who led the rebellion against Moses and Aaron in **Numbers 16**.

Here’s why:

- **Lineage of the rebel Korah:**  
  In Numbers 16, Korah is identified as *“the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi”* (Num. 16:1). That Korah is a direct grandson of Kohath.

- **Lineage in 1 Chronicles 6:**  
  In 1 Chronicles 6:22–23, the genealogy lists: Kohath → Amminadab → Korah → Assir.  
  This is a later descendant down the Kohathite line, not the immediate grandson who rebelled. It’s a separate Korah, generations later, within the same Levitical family.

- **Supporting clue:**  
  The “sons of Korah” later become known as a group of temple singers and psalmists (e.g., Psalms 42, 44–49, 84–88). These were descendants of the later Korah line—not the rebel himself, who perished. The Chronicler preserves their line as part of temple service.

So in short:  
- **Numbers 16 Korah** = grandson of Kohath, the rebel.  
- **1 Chronicles 6 Korah** = descendant of Kohath through Amminadab, ancestor of the psalmists.  

Would you like me to map out a side-by-side genealogy chart showing the “two Korahs” to make the difference even clearer?
