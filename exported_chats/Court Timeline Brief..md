I can help you create a timeline for your court appearance today. To get started, I'll need some details about your case. Could you please provide me with the following information?

1. The date when your tenancy began and the address of the rental property.
2. Any significant events related to your tenancy or interactions with your landlord, including dates. For example, repair requests, notices received, rent payments, meetings, or any other relevant communication or incidents.
3. The date and details of the eviction notice or any legal actions taken by your landlord.
4. Your responses or actions taken regarding the eviction process or any disputes with the landlord.

Once you provide this information, I'll structure it into a clear timeline suitable for your court brief.
