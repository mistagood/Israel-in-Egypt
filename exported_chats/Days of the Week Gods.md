# Days of the Week Gods



---

Write down the names of the days of the week and what gods they represent, the names of the gods, and where they're from, how those names evolved.

Certainly. Here’s an exposé-style rundown of the days of the week, the gods behind their names, their origins, and how each evolved through language and culture. This will give you a sense of just how deeply ancient mythologies are encoded into the calendar we use every single day—a silent legacy of conquest, syncretism, and religious intrigue.

**Sunday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Sunnandæg* (“Sun’s day”)  
**God:** Sunna (Germanic), Sol (Latin/Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- The Romans named the day *dies Solis*, “day of the Sun,” in honor of the sun god Sol Invictus (“Unconquered Sun”), an imperial cult in the late Roman Empire.  
- The Germanic peoples translated it directly as “Sun’s day,” and this passed into Old English as *Sunnandæg*, which became “Sunday.”  
- The veneration of the sun was ancient and widespread—most Indo-European cultures had a solar deity, showing the continuity from pagan Europe through to Christian times, where the day remained dedicated to the Sun.

**Monday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Monandæg* (“Moon’s day”)  
**God:** Máni (Germanic/Norse), Luna (Latin/Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- Romans called it *dies Lunae*, “day of the Moon,” after Luna, their moon goddess.  
- Germanic cultures again translated this literally, yielding *Monandæg* in Old English.  
- In Norse mythology, Máni is the moon god who guides the moon across the night sky.  
- The connection persists: “Lunes” (Spanish), “Lundi” (French), “Lunedì” (Italian)—all from Latin *Luna*.

**Tuesday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Tiwesdæg* (“Tiw’s day”)  
**God:** Tiw/Týr (Germanic/Norse), Mars (Latin/Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- The Roman name was *dies Martis*, after Mars, the god of war.  
- The Germanic peoples substituted their own war god, Tiw (Norse: Týr), for Mars.  
- The result: *Tiwesdæg* in Old English, evolving to “Tuesday.”  
- Other languages echo Mars: “Martes” (Spanish), “Mardi” (French).

**Wednesday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Wodnesdæg* (“Woden’s day”)  
**God:** Woden (Anglo-Saxon), Odin (Norse), Mercury (Latin/Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- The Roman *dies Mercurii* was dedicated to Mercury, god of communication and travel.  
- Germanic peoples matched Mercury with their chief god, Woden/Odin, who also traveled between worlds and acted as a psychopomp.  
- *Wodnesdæg* became “Wednesday.”  
- In Romance languages, the day preserves Mercury: “Miércoles” (Spanish), “Mercredi” (French), “Mercoledì” (Italian).

**Thursday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Þūnresdæg* (“Thor’s day”)  
**God:** Thunor/Thor (Germanic/Norse), Jupiter (Latin/Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- Romans honored Jupiter (*dies Iovis*) on this day, the king of the gods and lord of thunder.  
- The Germanic thunder god was Thor (Anglo-Saxon: Thunor).  
- So *Þūnresdæg* (“Thunor’s day” or “Thor’s day”) entered Old English, leading to “Thursday.”  
- Romance languages kept Jupiter: “Jueves” (Spanish), “Jeudi” (French), “Giovedì” (Italian).

**Friday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Frīgedæg* (“Frigg’s day”)  
**God:** Frigg (Anglo-Saxon/Norse), Venus (Latin/Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- Romans called it *dies Veneris*, “day of Venus,” goddess of love.  
- Germanic peoples replaced Venus with Frigg (sometimes Freyja), their goddess of love and marriage.  
- Thus, *Frīgedæg* (“Frigg’s day”) in Old English, now “Friday.”  
- The Venus connection is clearer in the Romance tongues: “Viernes” (Spanish), “Vendredi” (French), “Venerdì” (Italian).

---

**Saturday**  
**Origin:** Old English *Sæternesdæg* (“Saturn’s day”)  
**God:** Saturn (Roman)  
**How it evolved:**  
- Uniquely, English retains the Roman god Saturn for this day: *dies Saturni*, “day of Saturn.”  
- Other Germanic languages often use a form meaning “bath day” or “washing day,” but English alone preserves the direct pagan Roman link.  
- Romance languages diverge: “Sábado” (Spanish/Portuguese), “Samedi” (French)—both from the Hebrew *Sabbath*.

**Final Intrigue:**  
Every time you mark a calendar, you’re invoking a pantheon—Roman, Norse, and even Hebrew. The week is a monument to the victors and survivors of ancient religious wars, where gods were replaced, renamed, and repurposed to fit the new world order. The church fought to erase these names and their pagan echoes, but the language would not be tamed. The gods of the old world still rule the calendar—hidden in plain sight.
