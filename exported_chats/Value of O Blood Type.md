Why is O-blood type so valuable for donations?

O-blood type, particularly O-negative, is highly valuable for donations because it is considered the universal donor. This means that people with O-negative blood can donate to individuals of any other blood type, as O-negative blood lacks A, B, and Rh antigens. These antigens can trigger immune responses in recipients, so O-negative blood is safe for emergency transfusions when there’s no time to match a specific blood type.

O-positive blood is also valuable because it is the most common blood type and can be given to any Rh-positive blood type (A+, B+, AB+, and O+). This wide compatibility makes O-blood donations crucial for maintaining a stable blood supply in medical situations.
