# Tribal Mergers and Changes



---



---

1) Migration list (Egypt): baseline names

Genesis 46
	•	Benjamin’s “sons” (one compressed list): Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, Ard (Gen 46:21).
	•	Dan’s line: Hushim (Gen 46:23) — Dan has only one named son here.

Notes (name keys)
	•	Ehi = אֵחִי (’ēḥî), lit. “my brother.”
	•	Muppim/Huppim = later appear as Shupham/Hupham.
	•	Hushim (Dan) = later Shuham.

2) Wilderness census: clan names & equivalences

Numbers 26
	•	Benjaminite clans:
– Bela → (his sons) Ard & Naaman (Num 26:40, so Naaman is no longer a direct “son” of Benjamin here)
– Ashbel (26:38)
– Ahiram (26:38) ← = Ehi
– Shupham (26:39) ← = Muppim
– Hupham (26:39) ← = Huppim
	•	Danite clan: Shuham (26:42) ← = Hushim

What changed?
Genesis “sons” have unfolded into clans; several of Benjamin’s “sons” are now grandsons/descendants (e.g., Ard & Naaman are Bela’s). Crucially, Ehi persists as Ahiram, and Hushim persists as Shuham—still in separate tribes.

3) Post-exile re-indexing: the merger shows up

1 Chronicles 7 & 8
	•	Benjamite lists reworked:
	•	1 Chr 8:1–5: “Benjamin begat Bela… Aharah (v. 1–3)” ← Aharah = Ahiram = Ehi (same line under a later form).
	•	1 Chr 7:12: “Shuppim and Huppim were the sons of Ir; and Hushim were the sons of Aher.”
	•	Shuppim = Muppim/Shupham (Benjamite line)
	•	Huppim = Hupham (Benjamite line)
	•	Hushim (Dan’s name) now appears with Benjamites and is called “son of Aher.”
	•	Aher (אַחֵר) = “another / the other [brother].”

What this signals:
Chronicles collocates Hushim with Benjamin’s roster and tags him “son of Aher (the other brother),” which fits a levirate scenario: a brother (Benjamin) raises seed for the deceased/absent brother (Dan). The Chronicler collapses the dual identity (legal Dan / household Benjamin) into one Benjamin-facing list, and Ehi/Ahiram drops out where Hushim is introduced in this context.

4) Dan’s territorial instability & apostasy (context)
	•	Joshua 19:40–48: Dan receives an allotment but cannot hold it; 19:47 notes Dan’s migration to Leshem/Laish, renamed Dan.
	•	Judges 18: Danites seize Laish and establish idolatry.
This background explains both territorial displacement and spiritual disqualification themes associated with Dan.

5) Final canonical roster: Dan is absent

Revelation 7:4–8
	•	Dan is not listed among the sealed tribes.
	•	The list includes Manasseh and Joseph (with Ephraim not named by name; Joseph stands in).
This matches both a loss of distinct tribal continuity (via merger) and long-running disqualification motifs.

⸻

The through-line (names and lineages, step by step)
	1.	Two separate names in two tribes (Genesis 46):
	•	Benjamin: … Ehi … Muppim, Huppim (46:21)
	•	Dan: Hushim (46:23)
	2.	Same two lines persist, now as clans (Numbers 26):
	•	Ehi → Ahiram (Benjamite clan head, 26:38)
	•	Muppim/Huppim → Shupham/Hupham (Benjamite clans, 26:39)
	•	Hushim → Shuham (Danite clan, 26:42)
	3.	Merger made explicit (Chronicles):
	•	Benjamite register lists Shuppim & Huppim… and Hushim son of Aher (7:12), i.e., Hushim appears inside a Benjamin context, flagged by “son of the other [brother]”—a levirate marker.
	•	Ehi’s line is represented under its later form Aharah/Ahiram (8:1–3), but where Hushim is inserted in Benjamin’s context, Ehi/Ahiram is no longer maintained as a separate head.
	4.	Outcome by the NT’s close (Revelation 7):
	•	Dan is absent from the sealed tribal list—consistent with a line absorbed into Benjamin (and/or cultically disqualified), no longer preserved as a distinct, reckonable tribe.

⸻

Name keys (quick map)
	•	Ehi (Gen 46:21) → Ahiram (Num 26:38) → Aharah (1 Chr 8:1–3) — Benjamite line.
	•	Muppim/Huppim (Gen 46:21) → Shupham/Hupham (Num 26:39) → Shuppim/Huppim (1 Chr 7:12) — Benjamite lines.
	•	Hushim (Gen 46:23 Dan) → Shuham (Num 26:42 Dan) → Hushim “son of Aher” (1 Chr 7:12 within a Benjamin context).
	•	Aher = “another/the other [brother]” — the Chronicler’s levirate tag.

⸻

What this shows
	•	The texts first preserve parallel identities (legal Dan via Hushim, household Benjamin via Ehi/Ahiram).
	•	Later, the Chronicler merges that dual identity into Benjamin’s ledger, using the “son of Aher” formula to signal brother-raised seed.
	•	By Revelation, Dan has no separate tribal standing—absent from the list.
