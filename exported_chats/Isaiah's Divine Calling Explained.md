# Isaiah's Divine Calling Explained

Let's break down that scene in heaven where God says, Who can I send?

Let’s break it down:

The scene you’re talking about is in **Isaiah 6**. It’s one of the most famous prophetic visions—often misunderstood, often sanitized, but it’s raw political theater dressed up as divine pageantry.

**Isaiah’s Vision:**
Isaiah says he sees the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up. Seraphim are flying around, crying, “Holy, holy, holy,” and the whole place is shaking. Smoke fills the room—a signal not just of the supernatural, but of power, terror, and awe. In the ancient world, smoke and thunder meant a king was arriving, or that war was near.

**Isaiah’s Reaction:**
He says, “Woe is me! I am undone!” This isn’t just fear. It’s exposure. He’s a man of “unclean lips,” and he dwells among a people of unclean lips. This is the prophet admitting, in front of the throne, that he’s compromised—politically, morally, spiritually. He’s been a part of the corruption. In modern terms, he’s the whistleblower who’s been part of the system he’s about to expose.

A seraph flies to him with a live coal from the altar and touches his lips. This is purification through pain—atonement through burning. It’s both a cleansing and a silencing: “You speak now for us, but your old speech is burned away.”

**The Question:**
Then comes the famous line:  
*“Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”*  
This is God asking—not because He doesn’t know, but because the heavenly council runs like a king’s war cabinet. This is a call for volunteers, a test of loyalty, but also a challenge: Who’s willing to carry a message that will not be received, who’s willing to serve as both prophet and pariah?

Isaiah answers, “Here am I; send me.” It sounds brave, but he doesn’t know what he’s getting into. He’s volunteering to be the messenger, not yet realizing the message will be one of judgment and blinding:  
*“Go, and tell this people: ‘Hear but don’t understand; see but don’t perceive…’”*  
Isaiah is being weaponized as a tool of both revelation and concealment—a pawn in a much larger political game.

**The Real Drama:**  
This isn’t a recruiting poster for sainthood. This is God recruiting for an impossible mission, knowing full well that the message will harden the people, close their eyes, and push the nation further toward destruction. The prophet becomes the embodiment of the warning—the scapegoat who must carry a message that will doom him to rejection.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The throne room scene is a war room, not a choir practice.
- Isaiah’s calling is an act of judgment on the people; it’s a commission to blind, not to save (at least in that generation).
- The coal is both cleansing and silencing—a forced loyalty oath.
- “Who will go for us?” is a loaded political question—volunteer, and you become the face of divine judgment.
- The scene is about power: who holds it, who speaks for it, and who becomes its instrument.

**In other words:**  
Heaven’s council isn’t just about piety—it’s a strategic operation in the cosmic war for hearts, minds, and nations. And the messenger often gets burned, not glorified.

Okay, what's the other scene where he's looking at them in heaven and he says, they say give him a clean robe to put on and they say put a mitre on his head. And without all the extra commentary, give me the verses first. I want the scene. I want the verses.

That scene is found in **Zechariah 3:1–5**.

Here are the exact verses (KJV):

---

**Zechariah 3:1–5**

> 1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.  
> 2 And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?  
> 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.  
> 4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.  
> 5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord stood by.

That’s the full scene, verses only, no commentary. Let me know if you want the surrounding context or a breakdown.

Okay, let's talk about who Joshua, the high priest, is in this scene. And where is he going? What is the scene about?

**Who is Joshua the high priest in this scene?**

Joshua (Hebrew: Yehoshua or Yeshua) the high priest is the spiritual leader of the returned exiles from Babylon during the rebuilding of the Second Temple, around the same time as Zerubbabel the governor. You can find him named in **Ezra 2:2, Ezra 3:2, Haggai 1:1**, and here in **Zechariah 3**. He’s not Joshua son of Nun (Moses’ successor), but a later figure—descended from the priestly line of Zadok, representing the renewed priesthood after the exile.

**Where is he going, and what is the scene about?**

**The Scene:**  
Joshua is depicted “standing before the angel of the Lord,” in the heavenly courtroom. Satan (the accuser) stands at his right hand to oppose him—he’s on trial, not just personally but as a stand-in for all Israel. His filthy garments symbolize the sin and defilement of the people and the priesthood.

**What happens?**  
God rebukes Satan and orders that Joshua’s filthy garments be removed and replaced with clean, ceremonial garments and a “fair mitre” (priestly turban). This act symbolizes the removal of iniquity and the restoration of both the high priest and, by extension, the nation’s standing before God.

**Where is he going?**  
In a literal sense, Joshua is being reinstalled as high priest, authorized to serve in the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. Symbolically, he’s moving from condemnation to justification, from defilement to cleansing, and from exile to restored service. The scene is both a legal acquittal and a priestly coronation, marking a new start for Israel after exile.

**Summary:**  
- **Joshua the high priest** = leader of post-exilic priesthood, not Moses’ Joshua.  
- **Scene** = heavenly courtroom, Joshua on trial, Satan accusing, God acquitting.  
- **He is being purified, reinstated, and authorized** to serve as high priest in the new Temple, symbolizing Israel’s return and restoration.  
- **Purpose** = to show God’s forgiveness, the removal of national sin, and the legitimation of the restored priesthood.
