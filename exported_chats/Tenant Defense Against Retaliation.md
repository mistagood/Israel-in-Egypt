# Tenant Defense Against Retaliation



---



---

I’m facing an eviction from my landlord, who is retaliating against me for asserting my severely disabled son’s rights. They have been attempting to evict us for noise complaints ever since an adjoining apartment was rented. After being informed that they could not evict us for my son‘s disability, they begin to harass us by giving three day notices demanding rent when previously there have been a tendency for me to pay rent up to three weeks late with no three day notice or eviction. This began two months after I asserted my sons rights. After this the building went into the rape program for inhabitable conditions. In 2023 after this they still did not repair my heat and air conditioning so I had to withhold rent beginning October 2023. They finally made the repair in December 2023, but refused to except my rent. This is an illegal attempt to evict me because my son has a disability.

I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you and your son are facing with your landlord. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex situation involving potential retaliation, habitability issues, and disability rights. Let's break down the key points and discuss how you can use this information for your defense and potentially for a countersuit.

**1. Retaliation for Asserting Disability Rights:**
   - Under California law, it's illegal for landlords to retaliate against tenants for asserting their legal rights. Since you mentioned that the issues with your landlord began after asserting your son's rights, this could be viewed as retaliatory behavior.

**2. Noise Complaints and Disability Considerations:**
   - If the noise complaints are directly related to your son’s disability, it’s important to highlight that reasonable accommodations should be made under fair housing laws.

**3. Change in Rent Collection Practices:**
   - The shift in the landlord's approach to rent collection (issuing three-day notices for late rent) after you asserted your son's rights could further support the claim of retaliation.

**4. Rent Withholding Due to Habitability Issues:**
   - California law allows tenants to withhold rent if essential services like heating and air conditioning are not provided. However, this must be done carefully, following specific legal procedures. Documenting the lack of repairs and your communication with the landlord about these issues is crucial.

**5. Refusal to Accept Rent Post-Repair:**
   - The landlord's refusal to accept rent after repairs were made is concerning. This could be viewed as an illegal eviction attempt, especially if there's a pattern of retaliatory behavior.

For form MC-025, you'll need to organize this information chronologically and clearly. Here's how you can structure it:

- **Paragraph 1:** Introduction with your name, address, and a brief statement about facing eviction.
- **Paragraph 2:** Details about asserting your son's disability rights and the timeline of subsequent events (noise complaints, rent notice changes).
- **Paragraph 3:** Description of habitability issues (heating and air conditioning), including dates and your actions (withholding rent).
- **Paragraph 4:** Explanation of the landlord’s refusal to accept rent and your belief that this constitutes retaliation and an illegal eviction attempt.

Would you like assistance with drafting the specifics for MC-025 or more guidance on any of these points?

lets draft it for mc 025 denial and defense

Absolutely, let's draft a structured outline for the MC-025 form, focusing on your denial and defense against the eviction. Remember, this form is an attachment to other court documents, so it should complement your primary response filed with the court. Here's a structured outline based on your situation:

---

**[Your Full Name]**
**[Your Address, City, Los Angeles County, CA]**
**Case No.: [Your Case Number]**

**ATTACHMENT TO [specify the court form this MC-025 is attached to, e.g., Answer-Unlawful Detainer]**

---

**Paragraph 1: Introduction and Background**

"I, [Your Full Name], am a resident at [Your Address] and am responding to the eviction notice served by my landlord. I am a tenant in good standing and have been residing at this property since [Month, Year]. This response outlines my defense and reasons for denial of the eviction claim."

---

**Paragraph 2: Asserting Disability Rights and Retaliation**

"In [Month, Year], I informed my landlord of my son's severe disability, requiring certain accommodations as per fair housing laws. Following this, in [Month, Year], new tenants moved into an adjoining apartment. Subsequently, my landlord began issuing complaints and notices regarding noise, which are directly related to my son's disability. Prior to asserting my son’s rights, such complaints were not an issue, indicating a potential retaliatory motive for the eviction."

---

**Paragraph 3: Change in Rent Collection Practices**

"Traditionally, I have occasionally paid rent up to three weeks late, which was previously accepted without issue by my landlord. However, starting [Month, Year], just two months after I asserted my son’s rights, my landlord began issuing three-day notices for rent payments, deviating from past practice. This sudden change in rent collection policy further suggests retaliation."

---

**Paragraph 4: Habitability Issues and Rent Withholding**

"In [Month, Year], the building entered the REAP program due to inhabitable conditions. Despite this, my heat and air conditioning remained unrepaired, prompting me to withhold rent beginning October 2023, as is my right under California law when essential services are not provided. The necessary repairs were only made in December 2023."

---

**Paragraph 5: Refusal to Accept Rent Post-Repair**

"After the repairs were completed in December 2023, I attempted to resume rent payments. However, my landlord refused to accept rent, which I believe is an illegal attempt to evict me, influenced by my son's disability and our asserted rights. This refusal to accept rent, combined with the aforementioned issues, forms the basis of my defense against this eviction."

---

**Closing Statement**

"I respectfully request that the court consider these factors, which I believe demonstrate retaliatory and illegal actions by my landlord, in violation of California tenant laws and fair housing regulations. I am prepared to provide further evidence and testimony to support my defense."

I prefer one statement that I can copy as is

Certainly, I can provide a more consolidated statement for you to copy directly onto form MC-025. Here it is:

---

**[Your Full Name]**
**[Your Address, City, Los Angeles County, CA]**
**Case No.: [Your Case Number]**

**ATTACHMENT TO [specify the court form this MC-025 is attached to, e.g., Answer-Unlawful Detainer]**

"I, [Your Full Name], residing at [Your Address], hereby respond to the eviction notice served by my landlord. I assert that this eviction is retaliatory and illegal, stemming from my efforts to protect the rights of my severely disabled son. After informing my landlord of my son's disability in [Month, Year], we started receiving unwarranted noise complaints coinciding with new tenants in an adjoining apartment. Prior to this, despite occasionally paying rent late, no formal complaints or eviction attempts were made.

Significantly, two months after asserting my son's disability rights, my landlord began issuing three-day notices for late rent payments, a departure from their previous leniency. This change in behavior indicates retaliation. Moreover, the building entered the REAP program for inhabitable conditions, yet my heat and air conditioning remained unrepaired until December 2023. Legally withholding rent from October 2023 due to these conditions, I attempted to resume payments post-repair, but my landlord refused to accept, further suggesting an illegal eviction attempt based on disability discrimination.

This pattern of behavior from my landlord constitutes a violation of fair housing regulations and California tenant laws. I request the court to consider these retaliatory and discriminatory actions in my defense against this eviction."

Please ensure to fill in the specific dates and any additional personal details as needed. This statement is structured to fit into the MC-025 form, providing a clear, concise account of your situation for the court's consideration. If there are any other specific points or details you wish to include or modify, feel free to do so.

On November 3, 2023 I received a three day notice on November 6. I offered to pay the unpaid amount if they fix the repairs. On November 9 they agreed to fix the repairs. When the  repairs were done in December, they refused to accept the rent and proceeded to eviction.

Given the additional details you provided, I'll revise the statement to reflect these specific dates and events for your MC-025 form. Here's the updated version:

---

**[Your Full Name]**
**[Your Address, City, Los Angeles County, CA]**
**Case No.: [Your Case Number]**

**ATTACHMENT TO [specify the court form this MC-025 is attached to, e.g., Answer-Unlawful Detainer]**

"I, [Your Full Name], currently residing at [Your Address], am submitting this statement in response to the eviction notice I have received. This eviction action, I believe, is a result of unlawful retaliation and discrimination by my landlord due to my efforts to assert the rights of my severely disabled son.

In October 2023, I informed my landlord of my son's disability, and subsequently, unwarranted noise complaints began, coinciding with new occupants in an adjacent apartment. Prior to this, my occasional late rent payments were tolerated without any formal complaints or threats of eviction.

On November 3, 2023, I received a three-day notice for late rent. On November 6, I proposed to pay the overdue rent on the condition that essential repairs, including heating and air conditioning, were made in my unit. The landlord agreed to this on November 9. However, even after the repairs were completed in December 2023, the landlord refused to accept my rent payment and proceeded with eviction actions.

This sequence of events, starting from the assertion of my son’s disability rights to the landlord’s refusal to accept rent after agreeing to make necessary repairs, indicates a clear pattern of retaliatory and discriminatory behavior. This is in violation of fair housing regulations and California tenant laws. I respectfully request the court to consider these factors as part of my defense against this eviction."

That’s not what I said this is not how the story went. My neighbor moved in over a year ago. That’s when we started getting the complaints at that time I informed them that it was illegal to try to reflect us for noise so they began trying to evict us for being late on the rent. Then the program went into reap. After the rape account was closed on September 29, my apartment remained in disrepair I withheld rent. They gave me a three day notice. I agreed to pay. They agreed to the repairs. They did the repairs, but refused the rent. During this time I do not believe I was properly served the complaint or summons because I only received it on January 5 and it’s dated December 18. The mailboxes and the apartment building have been burglarized and were broken and unlocked from at least August until January, so I would have been unable to receive mail. This is due to their own negligence as well so it may have affected my ability to be served.

Thank you for clarifying the timeline and details of your situation. Let's revise the statement accordingly for the MC-025 form:

---

**[Your Full Name]**
**[Your Address, City, Los Angeles County, CA]**
**Case No.: [Your Case Number]**

**ATTACHMENT TO [specify the court form this MC-025 is attached to, e.g., Answer-Unlawful Detainer]**

"I, [Your Full Name], a resident of [Your Address], submit this statement in response to an eviction notice. This eviction, I believe, is a culmination of ongoing retaliatory actions by my landlord, initially triggered by noise complaints related to my son’s disability and later focused on rent payment issues.

Over a year ago, when new tenants moved into an adjoining apartment, we began receiving noise complaints. I informed my landlord that eviction attempts based on noise related to my son's disability would be illegal. Subsequently, the landlord shifted focus, attempting to evict us for late rent payments.

The building entered the REAP program due to habitability issues. However, even after the REAP account closure on September 29, my apartment remained in disrepair. Consequently, I withheld rent. In response, my landlord issued a three-day notice. I agreed to pay the overdue rent if repairs were made. The landlord consented, and the repairs were completed, but then they refused to accept my rent payment, leading to the current eviction process.

Additionally, I have concerns regarding the proper service of the eviction complaint and summons. I received these documents on January 5, yet they were dated December 18. The mailboxes in our building, due to landlord negligence, have been broken and unlocked from August until January, compromising mail security and potentially affecting the lawful service of these documents. This factor should be considered as it may have impacted my ability to respond in a timely manner."
