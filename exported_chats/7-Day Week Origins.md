# 7-Day Week Origins



---

Historically, did civilizations that used the 7-day week have a solar calendar, or were there civilizations that had a 7-day week that only used a lunar calendar, or did they have solar calendars in conjunction with the 7-day week?

Civilizations that adopted the 7-day week generally associated it with both lunar and solar calendars, but the origin of the 7-day week is more closely tied to lunar phases rather than solar cycles. The 7-day week likely developed as a reflection of the approximate quarter-phases of the moon (new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter), each occurring roughly every 7 days. 

Historically:

1. **Babylonians**: The 7-day week can be traced back to the Babylonians, who followed a lunisolar calendar. They used the phases of the moon to measure time and had a strong astrological and religious basis for the number seven, associating it with seven planetary bodies. While their calendar was lunar-based, they were also aware of the solar year and adjusted their calendar accordingly (adding an extra month periodically to synchronize it with the solar cycle).

2. **Jewish Calendar**: The Hebrew 7-day week, as established in the Bible, is tied to the creation narrative in Genesis, which outlines a 6-day creation and a 7th day of rest (Sabbath). The Jewish calendar is lunisolar, meaning it uses both the lunar months and solar year for adjustments. The 7-day week persisted independently of lunar cycles but was embedded within a broader lunisolar calendar system.

3. **Greco-Roman Calendar**: In the Roman Empire, a solar calendar (the Julian and later Gregorian calendars) was used, but the Romans eventually adopted the 7-day week, which was likely influenced by earlier cultures such as the Babylonians and Jewish practices. By this time, the 7-day week was no longer tied directly to lunar phases, as Roman culture emphasized solar measurements.

Thus, civilizations using a 7-day week often operated with a lunisolar framework, balancing both lunar and solar cycles in their calendars. Over time, the 7-day week became detached from strict lunar observance and persisted even within predominantly solar-based systems, as seen in later Roman and Christian calendars.

So you're saying that the Hebrews originally followed a lunisolar calendar rather than just a lunar calendar?

Yes, the Hebrews originally followed a **lunisolar calendar** rather than just a strictly lunar calendar. The Hebrew calendar, like many ancient systems, was based on the cycles of both the moon and the sun. Here's how it worked:

1. **Months**: The months were determined by the lunar cycle, with each new month beginning with the new moon. This is why the Hebrew word for "month" (*chodesh*) is closely related to the word for "new" (*chadash*), indicating the new moon.

2. **Year**: Although the months were lunar (about 29.5 days each), the Hebrews adjusted their calendar to stay in sync with the solar year. A lunar year is about 11 days shorter than a solar year, so the Hebrews added an extra month (called a leap month, or *Adar II*) every few years to bring the calendar back in alignment with the solar seasons. This adjustment ensured that festivals like Passover, which was tied to the agricultural cycle, would always occur in the spring.

3. **Festivals and Agriculture**: Many Hebrew festivals are tied to agricultural events that depend on the solar cycle, such as harvests and planting seasons, so it was crucial for the calendar to stay aligned with the solar year.

Thus, the Hebrew calendar is **lunisolar** because it uses the moon to mark months but adjusts to the solar year to maintain alignment with the seasons. This is similar to other ancient calendars, like the Babylonian system, which also influenced the Hebrews.
