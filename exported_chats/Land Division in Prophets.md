# Land Division in Prophets

---

Do Isaiah or Jeremiah talk about land being divided between the twelve tribes? And if so, what are they saying?

Yes, both Isaiah and Jeremiah discuss themes related to the land and its division, but they do so in more symbolic or prophetic ways rather than giving detailed descriptions of how land is to be physically divided among the twelve tribes, as seen in other books like Joshua and Ezekiel.

**Isaiah:**

In Isaiah, the theme of land and inheritance often comes up in the context of restoration and future hope. Isaiah speaks of the land as an inheritance that will be restored to Israel after a time of judgment and exile. For example, in **Isaiah 49:8**, it says:

> “Thus says the Lord: In a time of favor I have answered you, in a day of salvation I have helped you; I will keep you and give you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages.”

Here, Isaiah speaks of the restoration of land to the people of Israel, referring to the land’s division and return to the people as a future promise. However, Isaiah focuses more on the spiritual restoration of Israel rather than an exact geopolitical division of land.

In **Isaiah 61:7**, it also speaks of a double portion of inheritance:

> “Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy.”

This passage reflects the idea that after Israel's redemption, the people will receive more than what was originally lost, symbolizing abundant restoration, possibly to both the land and spiritual blessings.

**Jeremiah:**

Jeremiah focuses more on the judgment and exile of Israel and Judah due to their disobedience, but he also speaks about the restoration of the land. In **Jeremiah 3:18**, he mentions the reunification of the northern and southern kingdoms:

> “In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.”

This indicates that the land, which was originally divided between the tribes, will once again be unified under a restored Israel. While Jeremiah doesn’t go into detail about how the land will be divided, the promise of return to the ancestral land is significant.

In **Jeremiah 31:1-14**, the prophet speaks about the future restoration of Israel and the joy that will come when the people are reunited with their land, emphasizing the theme of inheritance, blessings, and land being returned to its rightful owners after the period of exile.

### Summary:

Isaiah and Jeremiah both speak about the land in terms of restoration and inheritance. While they don’t provide specific details on how the land will be divided among the twelve tribes, they emphasize that God’s people will return to the land, and the inheritance originally promised to the tribes will be restored. Isaiah tends to focus on the spiritual and symbolic restoration of the land, while Jeremiah ties the restoration to the reunification of Israel and Judah after exile.

Yes, it's specifically speaking about the end time of restoration with the trees on each side of a river, and it begins to talk about the tribes being a portion, and it goes into a listing.

You're referring to the prophetic vision in **Ezekiel 47–48**, which provides a detailed description of the division of the land among the twelve tribes during the end-time restoration, including the symbolic imagery of the river and the trees. While **Isaiah** and **Jeremiah** speak in more general terms about the restoration of Israel and its land, it is in **Ezekiel** where we see this specific, detailed vision of the land being apportioned to the tribes in the future kingdom.

In **Ezekiel 47:12**, Ezekiel describes a river that flows from the temple, with trees growing on both sides:

> "And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."

This mirrors the imagery you mentioned, and it symbolizes the life-giving and restorative power of God in the end times.

Then, in **Ezekiel 48**, the land is divided among the tribes of Israel. The chapter provides a detailed listing of how the land will be distributed, specifying portions for each tribe:

- The land is divided into parallel strips, with each tribe receiving a portion, starting with **Dan** in the far north and ending with **Gad** in the south.
- A special portion is set aside in the middle for the **priests**, the **Levites**, and the **city**. This central portion includes a section for the sanctuary (the temple), representing the spiritual heart of the land.
- Each tribe receives equal portions, and the listing in **Ezekiel 48** provides their names in a precise order.

The division of the land in Ezekiel emphasizes the restored kingdom, where each tribe will return to its rightful inheritance. This vision is very similar to the earlier distribution of the land under Joshua but represents the future, restored Israel, where the people will be brought back from exile and will dwell in their promised land once again.

This **end-time prophecy** is significant because it ties together physical restoration (the land itself) with spiritual restoration (the healing and life-giving water flowing from the temple, the presence of God in the midst of His people).

**Revelation 22** also picks up on this imagery of the river and the trees in the new heaven and new earth, showing a deep connection between Ezekiel's vision and the final restoration of all things.
