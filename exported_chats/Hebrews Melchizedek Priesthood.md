# Hebrews Melchizedek Priesthood



---



---

Hebrews says that someone testified, and I think they're talking about Jesus, that he said, thou hast made, been made a priest after the order of Melchizedek. What is he quoting there? What is Hebrews quoting when he says, for he said thou been made after the order of Melchizedek a priest?

The verse you're referring to comes from **Hebrews 5:5–6**, and the specific quote is:

> **Hebrews 5:6 (KJV)**  
> "As he saith also in another place, **Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek**."

This is a direct quotation from the **Book of Psalms**:

> **Psalm 110:4 (KJV)**  
> "The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, **Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek**."

### Hebrew Source (Psalm 110:4)
> **Hebrew (Masoretic Text):**  
> **נִשְׁבַּ֤ע יְהוָ֨ה | וְלֹ֬א יִנָּחֵ֗ם אַֽתָּה־כֹהֵ֥ן לְעוֹלָ֑ם עַל־דִּ֜בְרָתִ֗י מַלְכִּי־צֶֽדֶק׃**

**Transliteration:**  
*Nishba YHWH velo yinnaḥem: Atta kohen le-‘olam, al divrati Malki-Tzedek.*

**Literal Translation:**  
*"The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: 'You are a priest forever, according to the decree/order of Melchizedek.'"*

### Context in Hebrews
The author of Hebrews uses Psalm 110:4 to support the idea that **Jesus serves as a high priest**, not from the Levitical line (descended from Aaron), but **according to the unique and eternal priesthood of Melchizedek**, a mysterious figure who appears in **Genesis 14** as both a **king and a priest** of God Most High.

Hebrews references Psalm 110 multiple times:

- **Hebrews 5:6**  
- **Hebrews 6:20** – "made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."  
- **Hebrews 7:17** – reiterates the same Psalm quote again.

If you'd like, I can break down the Hebrew of *Malki-Tzedek* or explain why Psalm 110 is considered a Messianic Psalm in rabbinic and Christian traditions.

I want the text from Psalm 110.

Certainly. Here is the full text of **Psalm 110 (KJV)**, which is considered a royal and messianic psalm. It is often cited in the New Testament, especially in Hebrews, to support the claim of Jesus' priesthood "after the order of Melchizedek."

### **Psalm 110 (King James Version)**

> **1** The LORD said unto my Lord,  
> Sit thou at my right hand,  
> until I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
>   
> **2** The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion:  
> rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.  
>   
> **3** Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power,  
> in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning:  
> thou hast the dew of thy youth.  
>   
> **4** The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent,  
> Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  
>   
> **5** The Lord at thy right hand  
> shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.  
>   
> **6** He shall judge among the heathen,  
> he shall fill the places with the dead bodies;  
> he shall wound the heads over many countries.  
>   
> **7** He shall drink of the brook in the way:  
> therefore shall he lift up the head.
