# Reciprocal punishment table

God often uses irony to punish people. In other words, when they're disobedient in the wilderness and they complain about meat, he gives them quail, he says, until it's coming out of their ears and they sin and he strikes them down. The prophets say, you're just God because they have shed blood and you've given them blood to drink. And so, there's a righteous retribution that comes. And so, there's always a connection with the punishment and with the action. Let's take a look at examples that we can find of this in the Bible, all the examples. We can find at least five examples.

Yes—this is a consistent biblical pattern. The irony is that God often punishes people with the very thing they crave, misuse, or trust in. This is called *measure for measure* justice (Hebrew: **middah k'neged middah**, "measure corresponding to measure"). Let’s walk through some of the clearest examples:

---

### 1. **Quail in the Wilderness**  
- **Reference:** Numbers 11:18–20, 31–33  
- **Action:** The Israelites complain, saying they are tired of manna and demand meat, longing for Egypt’s food.  
- **Punishment:** God gives them quail—*so much quail that it becomes loathsome to them*. While the meat is still in their mouths, His anger burns and many die at Kibroth Hattaavah (“graves of craving”).  
- **Irony:** Their lust for meat directly kills them; they are buried because of their craving.

---

### 2. **Blood to Drink in Retribution**  
- **Reference:** Revelation 16:5–6 (echoing prophetic justice themes like Isaiah 49:26).  
- **Action:** They shed the blood of saints and prophets.  
- **Punishment:** God gives them blood to drink.  
- **Irony:** They literally consume what they spilled; violence returns upon the violent.

---

### 3. **Idolatry Leading to Slavery**  
- **Reference:** Psalm 106:36–41; Jeremiah 2:19; Judges 10:13–14.  
- **Action:** Israel worships idols of the nations, seeking strength and prosperity through them.  
- **Punishment:** God hands them over to those very nations as slaves and oppressors.  
- **Irony:** What they trusted in (foreign gods, foreign alliances) becomes their downfall.

---

### 4. **Pharaoh’s Drowning in the Sea**  
- **Reference:** Exodus 1:22; Exodus 14:26–28.  
- **Action:** Pharaoh commands all Hebrew baby boys to be drowned in the Nile.  
- **Punishment:** Pharaoh’s own army is drowned in the Red Sea.  
- **Irony:** The instrument of his cruelty becomes the means of his own destruction.

---

### 5. **Haman Hung on His Own Gallows**  
- **Reference:** Esther 7:9–10.  
- **Action:** Haman builds a gallows to hang Mordecai, plotting against the Jews.  
- **Punishment:** Haman is hanged on the very gallows he built.  
- **Irony:** His scheme rebounds perfectly onto him.

---

### Additional Examples (beyond the five):
- **Adoni-Bezek** (Judges 1:6–7): who cut off thumbs and toes of 70 kings, later has his own cut off.  
- **David’s Sin with Bathsheba** (2 Samuel 12): he takes another man’s wife secretly; Nathan tells him his own wives will be taken openly.  
- **Edom/Obadiah 1:15**: “As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head.”

---

In all these, the punishment is not random—it mirrors the sin, turning desire or cruelty back on the sinner in poetic justice.  

Would you like me to build you a **comprehensive list in table form** (sin → ironic punishment → verse) so you can use it as a ready reference?

---

Let's not omit the parts that, um, they talk about those who take people into captivity will go into captivity, and those who kill with the sword must be killed with the sword, and so forth.

Nice — let’s fold those explicit reciprocity sayings into the catalog so the pattern is airtight. Below I give a compact table of **sins** → **ironic/reciprocal punishment** → **key verse(s)**, then add a few short passages that state the rule plainly (so we don’t “omit the parts” you called out).

# Quick table — sin → ironic/reciprocal punishment → verse
| Sin / action | Ironic or reciprocal punishment | Key verse(s) (reference & brief note) |
|---|---:|---|
| Craving meat and despising manna | God gives quail until it becomes a curse; many die | Numbers 11:18–20, 31–33 (quail → Kibroth-hattaavah) |
| Shedding the blood of saints/prophets | Given blood to drink (retributive punishment) | Revelation 16:5–6; cf. prophetic themes in Isaiah |
| Trusting idols / foreign allies | Handed over into the power of those nations (captivity) | Psalm 106:36–41; Judges 10:13–14 (idolatry → oppression) |
| Infanticide by drowning (Pharaoh) | Drowned in the sea (Pharaoh’s army) | Exodus 1:22; 14:26–28 (the Nile/sea turns on them) |
| Building an instrument of execution for others | Hanged on his own gallows | Esther 7:9–10 (Haman’s gallows) |
| Violence / sword-killing | Killed by the sword (reciprocal) | Revelation 13:10 (captures the reciprocity formula) |
| Taking people captive | Taken into captivity | Revelation 13:10; broader prophetic echo: “as you have done” passages (Obadiah, Ezekiel) |
| General moral reciprocity | People reap what they sow; God is not mocked | Galatians 6:7; Obadiah 1:15 (“as you have done, it shall be done to you”) |
| Personal vengeance mirror | One who mutilated others later mutilated | Judges 1:6–7 (Adoni-Bezek: what he did returned on him) |
| Secret abuse of another’s rights | Public humiliation / loss of what was taken | 2 Samuel 12 (Nathan’s parable → David told the sword/household judgment) |

# Short, explicit passages that state the rule (KJV phrasing for familiarity)
- **Revelation 13:10** — *“If any man have an ear, let him hear. If any man is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: **if any man kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed.**”*  
  — This verse is the crystallized reciprocity formula you referenced: captivity ↔ captivity, sword ↔ sword.

- **Galatians 6:7** — *“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for **whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.**”*  
  — Plain moral law: action returns to actor.

- **Obadiah 1:15** — *“For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: **as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee**: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.”*  
  — Prophetic “as you did, so it will be done to you” language.

# A few short notes tying the rule to the examples
- The pattern is consistent: **the instrument, desire, or trust that the sinner relied on becomes the medium of judgment**. Quail were their desire; quail became the instrument of punishment. Pharaoh used the Nile and drowning against infants; the sea drowned his forces. Haman’s gallows become Haman’s fate. Revelation 13:10 gives the theological formula in apocalyptic language: captivity for captivity, sword for sword. Galatians supplies the general moral principle that undergirds it all.

- Hebrew prophetic literature often phrases this as *midah k’neged midah* (measure for measure) — the measure you mete is the measure returned. That legal/ethical symmetry is a running theological motif from the Torah through the prophets into the New Testament/apocalypse.

I’ve folded the captivity/sword lines into the list and highlighted the explicit texts that state the reciprocity rule. If you want, I can expand this into a verse-by-verse dossier (each row with the full passage, historical context, and a one-line exegesis).
