Capricorn in the Hebrew Mazzaroth is called **Gedi (גְּדִי)**, meaning *“Kid”* or *“young goat.”* This sign is associated with the tribe of **Asher**, whose blessing from Jacob was:  
> “Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.” (Genesis 49:20)

So while the Western zodiac frames Capricorn as the *Sea-Goat* symbol of discipline, endurance, and ambition, the Hebrew Mazzaroth layers it with richer agricultural and covenantal meaning. In this tradition, **Gedi (Capricorn)** embodies nourishment, abundance, and survival through the harshest season—the ability to produce *fatness* (wealth, sustenance, divine blessing) even in the depths of winter【6†Mazarroth†L79-L86】.

**Key traits of Capricorn / Gedi:**
- **Season:** Winter solstice—when the sun begins its return. Symbolically, it’s the point where light is reborn out of darkness.  
- **Element:** Earth. The goat climbs the rocky terrain, signifying perseverance, prudence, and stability.  
- **Symbolism in Israel’s tribes:** Asher’s “royal dainties” imply an ability to feed kings and provide delight during scarcity. Capricorn thus signifies *sustenance under pressure*, *faithful labor*, and *hidden fertility*.  
- **Spiritual tone:** Asher’s portion is prophetic of future prosperity after struggle—“he shall overcome at the last.” Capricorn, therefore, represents triumph over time, the preservation of goodness through endurance, and the quiet blessing that emerges from steadfastness.  
- **Body / terrain correspondence:** Knees or the upper leg—support and ascent; Capricorn governs the body’s structure that climbs upward, both physically and spiritually.

In essence, **Gedi / Capricorn / Asher** portrays the faithful worker who survives winter’s trials and emerges to bring abundance. It is the sign of endurance rewarded, of divine provision manifesting when all seems barren—a portrait of the soul’s strength in lean times.
