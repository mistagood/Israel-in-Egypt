How do I take a freeze off my credit report? And what is it? I think I might have put it on. Is that the only way it could be on there, is if I put it on?

### What Is a Credit Freeze?

A **credit freeze**, also called a **security freeze**, is a free tool provided by the three major credit bureaus—**Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion**—that **restricts access to your credit report**. This prevents new creditors from viewing your report, which in turn **stops anyone (including identity thieves) from opening new credit accounts in your name**.

A credit freeze:
- **Does not affect** your credit score.
- **Does not prevent** you from using your existing credit cards or accounts.
- **Can be lifted temporarily or permanently**, either online, by phone, or by mail.

### Did You Put It On Yourself?

Yes—**only you (or your authorized legal representative)** can place a credit freeze on your credit file. It **does not happen automatically**. So if you see a freeze, it's because:
- You set it up directly with Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.
- You may have used an identity protection service that initiated the freeze on your behalf, with your consent.
- In some rare legal cases, a parent or guardian can freeze a minor's credit.
