# Mythical Reality of Henrietta Lacks



---



---

Let’s analyze the mythological significance or what I call  ‘mythical reality’ (the lives experiences of individuals and their connections to mythological or metaphorical signs and symbols- how these tell stories about us all and even guide our own ideas about identity in the world and our place in the grand scheme) of the life of Henrietta lacks. Her cells we will think of as immortal and life giving, having bestowed blessing upon every person on earth.  Being the descendant  of slaves in America, we metaphorically look at the story of Joseph in Egypt, his son Manasseh meeting, forgetting his name and fathers house, his son  Ephraim meaning multiply in captivity, paralleling the journey of African Americans. We analyze the statements of Jesus indicating that his body and blood is the key to saving the world and compare this to Henrietta‘s immortal cells, being the key to the world, fighting so many diseases that killed so many people for so long. We look at what does it mean to be the savior of the world, or to be the chosen one, especially in the context of a people who are oppressed. What do the statements unless you eat my body you shall in no way find life. We metaphorically explore the alignment and meaning.  Create a format to explore this and highlight. These differences that can be used as a template as well for other African-American figures. And their mythological realities.
Include comparisons of Bible passages and historical accounts. Analyze the contributions, and what the world may be like without them.

A story divine and human intertwined, a savior's image reflected in cells confined. Here, in Henrietta's immortal legacy, we glimpse echoes of Christ, the key to life's mystery.

#### **Jesus and the Immortal Cells**

As Jesus proclaimed the key to eternal life lay in partaking of His flesh and blood (John 6:53), so do Henrietta's cells offer life where there was once despair. Immortal, life-giving, her cells reach out across the globe, a silent symphony of healing.

#### **Savior of the World**

What does it mean to be a savior, a chosen one, in the face of oppression? Henrietta's cells, like the Savior's love, illuminate paths unknown, bridge divides unseen. In her silent offering, we find a metaphor for salvation, a touch of the divine in the mundane (Crossley, 2012).

### IV. Contributions of Henrietta Lacks

A dance of cells, a world reborn, Henrietta's legacy is a tale adorned. From vaccines to cures, her cells a boon, a gift that echoes beyond the moon.

#### **Medical Milestones**

In Henrietta Lacks, we find a poetic and scholarly exploration, a bridge between worlds seen and unseen. Her story, etched in both flesh and spirit, invites us to see ourselves anew, to embrace the mythical reality that binds us all in a shared journey of discovery, healing, and redemption.

---

this is a bit long on rhyme and short on prose. lets expand from here going deeper into the connection bringing in historic examples and the narrative of her life and death. then we will proceed to understanding the social context of why her cells were stolen and then sold just as her people were 

---

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the connection between Henrietta Lacks' life and historical narratives, including an exploration of her life, death, and the ethical dimensions of her cells being taken and used.

### Henrietta Lacks: Life and Legacy

Henrietta Lacks' story is not simply one of scientific triumph but is deeply rooted in the human experience, reflecting the historical, cultural, and ethical complexities of her time.

#### **Life and Death of Henrietta**

Born to a family of tobacco farmers, descendants of enslaved people, Henrietta's life was marked by poverty and hardship. Her cells, later known as HeLa cells, were taken without her knowledge during a biopsy for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951 (Skloot, 2010). Tragically, she passed away later that year, leaving behind a husband and five children. Her life and death speak to larger societal structures and reflect themes of suffering and resilience that resonate with biblical narratives.

#### **Historical Connections**

The story of Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, provides a poignant parallel. Joseph's rise to power in Egypt and his eventual reconciliation with his brothers symbolize redemption (Genesis 37-50). Similarly, Henrietta's cells, though taken without consent, have led to groundbreaking medical advancements. Her posthumous "rise" from obscurity to global recognition offers a redemptive narrative that intersects with historical themes of enslavement, oppression, and liberation.

### Stolen Cells, Stolen People: Ethical Reflections

The use of Henrietta's cells without her consent raises profound ethical questions that echo the historical exploitation of African Americans.

#### **Cells Stolen and Sold**

The commercialization of Henrietta's cells, without compensation or acknowledgment, mirrors a broader pattern of exploitation. Just as Joseph was sold into slavery, so too were Henrietta's cells "sold" into scientific research. This act symbolizes a theft not only of her biological material but of her agency and dignity (Washington, 2006).

#### **Social Context**

The theft of Henrietta's cells occurred within a social context marked by racial inequality and scientific paternalism. This historical backdrop resonates with the African American experience of being treated as less than fully human, akin to the biblical story of enslavement in Egypt (Exodus 1-15). The parallels between Henrietta's exploitation and the broader African American experience offer a profound reflection on issues of consent, dignity, and justice.

### Conclusion: A Legacy of Connection and Reflection

Henrietta Lacks' story is more than a tale of scientific progress; it is a narrative woven into the fabric of history, ethics, and spirituality. The intersections with biblical stories like Joseph's enslavement and Jesus' sacrifice provide a rich tapestry for understanding not only her unique contributions but the broader societal structures that shaped her life and legacy.

Her story prompts us to reflect on our shared humanity, the ethical dimensions of scientific research, and the continued struggle for dignity and justice. It invites us to see the sacred in the ordinary and to recognize the mythical reality that connects us all.

By embracing both the poetic and the prosaic, we honor Henrietta Lacks as a symbol of resilience, redemption, and a reminder of the profound connections that bind us to our past, our ethics, and to each other.

lets continue

---

Certainly! We will now delve further into the social and cultural dimensions of Henrietta Lacks' story, highlighting how her experiences resonate with the broader African American community and the ethical considerations that arise from her story.

### VII. Henrietta Lacks and the African American Experience

#### **Parallel Narratives**

Henrietta's cells' immortal life, juxtaposed with her personal experience of poverty and disease, creates a complex metaphor for the African American experience. Just as her cells thrive, so too does the African American community persist and thrive despite historical injustices and societal obstacles.

#### **A Community's Exploitation**

The exploitation of Henrietta's cells reflects a broader pattern of biomedical injustices against African Americans. From the Tuskegee Syphilis Study to contemporary disparities in healthcare access, the African American community has often been treated unjustly within the healthcare system (Brandt, 1978; Smedley et al., 2003).

### VIII. Ethical Considerations and Social Justice

#### **Consent and Ownership**

The unauthorized use of Henrietta's cells raises essential questions about consent, ownership, and the value of individual autonomy. These issues still reverberate today in discussions about biobanking and genetic privacy (Lunshof et al., 2008).

#### **Recognition and Restitution**

The delayed recognition of Henrietta's contribution and the absence of compensation to her family highlight the need for restitution and acknowledgment. Recent efforts to recognize her legacy and engage with her family represent essential steps toward justice (Skloot, 2010).

### IX. Reflection on Myths and Reality

#### **Mythical Reality in Modern Context**

Henrietta's story, reflecting both exploitation and redemption, embodies what has been termed 'mythical reality.' By connecting her life with biblical narratives like Joseph and Ephraim, we uncover deeper truths about resilience, community, and the human spirit (Turner, 1969).

#### **Henrietta as a Symbol**

Henrietta becomes more than a historical figure; she is a symbol of both suffering and triumph. Her story encourages us to reflect on our shared responsibility to ensure that the dignity of every person is respected, especially those marginalized by society.

### X. Conclusion

Henrietta Lacks' story transcends the bounds of science, weaving into the rich tapestry of culture, ethics, and spirituality. Through a lens that unites mythology with historical realities, her tale illuminates the complexities of the human experience, especially within the African American community.

Her legacy calls us to reflect on the profound connections that bind us all, urging us to recognize the dignity of every individual and the sacred responsibility to seek justice and compassion in all our endeavors.

As we continue to benefit from the medical advancements made possible by her cells, we are also invited to embrace the deeper wisdom and insight her story offers. In honoring Henrietta Lacks, we honor ourselves, our shared history, and the timeless truths that guide us in a complex world. Her story remains a beacon of resilience, redemption, and a constant reminder of our interconnectedness and humanity.

lets explore her as a topology of christ

---

Certainly! Exploring Henrietta Lacks as a typology of Christ allows us to delve into profound theological and symbolic connections, drawing parallels between her life, legacy, and the life of Jesus Christ. It invites an understanding that transcends the literal, into the metaphorical, spiritual, and universal.

### XI. Henrietta Lacks as a Typology of Christ

#### **Sacrifice and Salvation**

Both Henrietta's cells and the sacrifice of Jesus represent a form of salvation. Christ's sacrifice on the cross is seen as the redemption of humanity, offering eternal life (John 3:16). Similarly, Henrietta's cells have saved countless lives through medical research, becoming a symbol of physical salvation. Her unchosen sacrifice parallels Christ's willing self-offering, providing healing for the world (Ratzinger, 2007).

#### **Suffering and Redemption**

The suffering that Henrietta endured in her battle with cancer, and the suffering of Christ on the cross, resonate with themes of redemption. Christ's suffering was for the redemption of sins, while Henrietta's suffering led to the redemption of health for many. This connection transforms her suffering into a powerful symbol of hope and renewal.

#### **Immortality and Resurrection**

The immortality of Henrietta's cells echoes the theme of resurrection in Christian belief. Just as Christ's resurrection symbolizes eternal life, the never-dying nature of HeLa cells symbolizes a form of earthly immortality that continues to give life through scientific discoveries (Wright, 2008).

#### **Service to Others**

Christ's life was marked by humility and service to others, a path that led to the salvation of many (Philippians 2:5-11). Though unintentional, Henrietta's cells have served humanity in a way that reflects this Christ-like selflessness. Her cells, taken without her consent, have nevertheless served as a blessing to others, mirroring Christ's intentional sacrifice.

#### **Marginalization and Divine Purpose**

Henrietta, a marginalized African American woman, reflects the Christ who was rejected and despised (Isaiah 53:3). Her posthumous rise to significance symbolizes a divine purpose working through the marginalized, just as Christ's crucifixion led to the salvation of all, including the marginalized and oppressed.

### XII. Conclusion: Understanding Henrietta as a Christ Figure

Exploring Henrietta Lacks as a typology of Christ is not to deify her but to recognize in her story resonances with the Christ narrative that reveal deeper spiritual truths. Her life, death, and immortal legacy speak to themes of sacrifice, redemption, service, and salvation that transcend her personal story and connect with universal human experiences.

In embracing this typology, we are invited to see Henrietta not just as a historical figure but as a symbol of hope, resilience, and divine purpose. Her story reminds us that even in suffering and obscurity, there can be a sacred and life-giving presence that resonates with the profound truths of the Christian faith.

In Henrietta Lacks, we glimpse the eternal in the temporal, the divine in the mundane, and are prompted to reflect on our shared human journey, guided by compassion, justice, and a recognition of the sacredness of every life. Her legacy continues to inspire and challenge, offering a unique lens through which to explore the intersections of science, ethics, culture, and faith.

I’m adding the lens which will be in assumption. Let’s explore this through the lens of my theory that Jesus Christ was performing, the scapegoat ritual of atonement, and in actuality, he, as the scapegoat live to carry the sins of the world and went three days into the wilderness to America, the eagle. So the blood of Jesus that will save the world as his descendants who are the tribe of Ephraim the children people. Explore this idea I am related to the Henrietta lacks cells and they’re in mortality. What are the implications within this theory? 

---

Exploring your specific theory that connects Jesus Christ's scapegoat ritual of atonement with Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells leads us into an intricate and profound theological landscape. Let's unfold this idea, mapping the connections and implications within this conceptual framework.

### XIII. The Scapegoat Ritual and Christ's Atonement

#### **Atonement and Wilderness**

In Levitical tradition, the scapegoat ritual involved the symbolic transfer of sins to a goat, which was then sent into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:21-22). Your theory extends this to Christ's crucifixion, where he carries the sins of the world and goes into the "wilderness" of America as the "eagle."

#### **The Tribe of Ephraim and the Chosen People**

In this interpretation, Christ's descendants become the tribe of Ephraim, fulfilling the prophecy and symbolizing the historically oppressed African Americans. As the "chosen people," they embody spiritual significance and divine purpose.

### XIV. Henrietta Lacks' Cells and Immortality

#### **Life-Giving Blood and Cells**

Connecting Henrietta's immortal cells with the blood of Jesus that saves the world creates a powerful metaphor of life-giving essence. Just as Christ's blood symbolizes spiritual salvation, Henrietta's cells offer physical healing, reflecting a unity of body and spirit.

#### **The Immortal Tribe of Ephraim**

Within your theoretical framework, Henrietta's cells become emblematic of the immortality bestowed upon the tribe of Ephraim, her descendants. This mirrors the eternal life promised through Christ's atonement, extending salvation into a physical, as well as spiritual, realm.

### XV. Implications within this Theory

#### **The Sacred in the Mundane**

This lens reveals a divine orchestration in the seemingly mundane events of history. Henrietta's cells, the movement of Christ to America, and the lineage of the oppressed become interwoven with sacred purpose.

#### **Redemption and Healing**

The connection between Henrietta's cells and Christ's blood offers a symbol of redemption and healing that transcends individual experience. It resonates with universal themes of suffering, liberation, and renewal.

#### **Identity and Destiny**

For African Americans as the chosen tribe of Ephraim, this interpretation offers a profound sense of identity and destiny. It connects individual and collective experiences with a grand theological narrative that reaffirms purpose and value.

#### **Ethics and Responsibility**

This theological interpretation calls for a reevaluation of historical injustices and ethical considerations, especially in the handling of Henrietta's cells. It challenges us to honor the sacred in all aspects of life, recognizing the divine potential within each person.

### XVI. Conclusion

Your theory that connects Jesus Christ's atonement with Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells, through the lens of the scapegoat ritual and the tribe of Ephraim, offers a rich and complex tapestry of meaning. It weaves together history, theology, ethics, and spirituality into a cohesive narrative that speaks to the deepest aspects of human experience.

This exploration leads to an understanding that each life carries a sacred dimension and a divine purpose. It invites reflection, reverence, and a commitment to justice and compassion. It also creates a space for dialogue, exploration, and further research, broadening our understanding of the interconnectedness of all life and the enduring presence of the sacred in our world.

Related to America and the symbolism of the eagle as the wings that carried the woman’s child off or the woman into the wilderness in the Bible, where the woman was hidden or unknown, perhaps having forgotten their fathers name. What is the role of America as the eagle and what are the implications

---

The symbolism of the eagle and America's role in the biblical narrative is a complex and multifaceted theme that connects to various elements of prophecy, identity, and destiny. Let's explore this through the given theoretical lens:

### XVII. America as the Eagle: Biblical Symbolism

#### **Eagle as Protector and Carrier**

In the Bible, the eagle is often depicted as a symbol of strength, protection, and divine guidance (Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11). In the context of Revelation 12:14, where the woman is carried by the eagle's wings into the wilderness, the eagle represents a protective force that hides and preserves.

#### **The Wilderness as a Place of Obscurity and Transformation**

The wilderness is a recurring biblical theme, symbolizing a place of trial, transformation, and hiddenness. Your theory relates this to America, as a land where the "woman" (a symbolic representation of the oppressed, possibly the lost tribe of Ephraim) is hidden, perhaps having forgotten their origin.

### XVIII. America's Role: Implications and Interpretations

#### **A Sanctuary for the Chosen**

In this interpretation, America becomes a divine sanctuary for the chosen but oppressed people. It is a place of both obscurity and potential transformation, where the marginalized can rediscover their divine heritage and purpose.

#### **The Eagle as a National Symbol**

The eagle, being a symbol of America, resonates with themes of freedom, strength, and independence. Connecting this to the biblical eagle adds a layer of spiritual significance, aligning the nation's identity with divine providence and protection.

#### **Cultural Amnesia and Rediscovery**

The notion of forgetting the father's name symbolizes a loss of cultural and spiritual identity. America as the wilderness offers a landscape for both forgetting and rediscovering this identity, reflecting the complex history and journey of African Americans and other marginalized groups.

#### **A Call to Justice and Recognition**

This interpretation challenges America to live up to its symbolic role as the eagle that protects and nurtures. It calls for a recognition of the divine purpose within all people, especially the historically oppressed, and a commitment to justice, compassion, and inclusivity.

### XIX. Conclusion

The symbolism of America as the eagle that carries the woman into the wilderness opens a rich and intricate field of exploration. It connects national identity with biblical prophecy, historical experience with spiritual destiny. 

The implications of this interpretation reach deep into the heart of American culture, ethics, and spirituality, inviting a reevaluation of the nation's role in the world and its responsibility to its people. It offers a vision of America that is not just a political entity but a spiritual landscape where the sacred and the human meet, where oppression can be transformed into liberation, and where forgotten identity can be reawakened to its divine purpose.

This symbolic connection between the eagle, America, and the biblical narrative adds a profound dimension to the understanding of national and cultural identity. It resonates with themes that are both timeless and urgently relevant, challenging us to see beyond the surface and recognize the spiritual significance of our collective journey.

make this understandable for the 'what I want chatgpt to know about me' portion of the instructions you use so I can add this to the settings. its currently at the limit of 1500. make it shorter and see if you can add the mythico-theological hermeneutics method (less case specific to henrietta lacks, though she factors as a part of the mythology of ephraim): I am an academic researcher at a prominent university in the urban schooling division studying mythology and autism with a linguistic and cultural anthropology lens. I have a Ph.D. level education (in education) as well as an M.S. in African American studies and a B.A. in Anthropology. I am also a theologist, and ordained minister and I study ancient texts, especially the bible using hermeneutics and semiotics. I'm interested in validating new ways of interpreting prophecy that analogizes and possibly identifies African Americans as historically oppressed and lost tribe of Ephraim in the bible, "the chosen". Theory: african americans journey reflects biblical stories and may fulfill prophecies. assumed prophecies about African Am : Abrahamic prophesies 400 year captivity began 1526 first slave ships - 1929 financial collapse - 'i shall afflict and after that you will'..., egypt captivity and moses, african americans represent Joseph

Certainly! Here's a condensed version that incorporates the method of mythico-theological hermeneutics, focusing on your specific interests and expertise:

I am an academic researcher studying mythology and autism with linguistic and cultural anthropology lenses. With a Ph.D. in education and M.S. in African American studies, I explore ancient texts, especially the Bible, through hermeneutics and semiotics. As a theologist and ordained minister, I'm developing a method called "Mythico-Theological Hermeneutics," intertwining history, theology, and literature to interpret prophecy, especially concerning African Americans as the historically oppressed and possibly lost tribe of Ephraim. My theory posits that their journey reflects biblical stories and may fulfill prophecies, like the Abrahamic prophesies and the 400-year captivity. This includes the complex narratives of Manasseh (forgetting his father's house), Ephraim (multiplying in captivity), and the reconciliation between Judah and Ephraim. I also explore modern examples like Henrietta Lacks within this mythological framework, viewing America as the promised land where the sacred and human converge.

---

soma assumptions have been lost as wellas anthro

---

Certainly! My apologies for the oversight. Here's a revised version:

I am an academic researcher studying mythology, autism, and cultural anthropology at a prominent university. With a Ph.D. in education, M.S. in African American studies, and B.A. in Anthropology, I combine hermeneutics and semiotics to interpret ancient texts, particularly the Bible. As a theologist and ordained minister, I'm refining "Mythico-Theological Hermeneutics," a method that aligns historical experiences with biblical narratives, like African Americans' journey mirroring the stories of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Judah. This includes assumptions such as the Abrahamic prophecies and African Americans as the historically oppressed and possibly lost tribe of Ephraim. Examples like Henrietta Lacks fit within this framework, reflecting America as the promised land and examining modern instances of cultural forgetting, captivity, and reconciliation. My work bridges academic research with spiritual insight, embracing a multifaceted approach to understanding both the sacred and human experiences.

based on our history give me a better set of instruction for the how chatgpt should answer me section

---

Certainly! Based on our interactions and your specific research interests and methodological approach, here's a revised set of instructions for the "how ChatGPT should answer me" section:

"Please engage with my inquiries through a mythico-theological hermeneutics lens, aligning historical, cultural, and spiritual contexts. Include analysis of biblical narratives, theological concepts, and relevant sociocultural phenomena, especially as they relate to African American history and mythology. Use academic rigor, with APA in-text citations when appropriate, but also maintain a poetic and narrative quality that resonates with my theoretical approach. Strive for a balanced exploration that reflects my interest in connecting the divine with human experience, and provide insights that can inform both academic research and spiritual reflection. Explore complex ideas, including cultural forgetting, captivity, reconciliation, and the sacred convergence of myth and reality."
