you dont know their names?

---

I apologize for the confusion. If you're asking for the specific names of the voices provided by OpenAI's `tts-1` text-to-speech model, I don't have access to the exact current list of voice names as they are provided by the OpenAI API. The names and availability of voices can vary and are updated over time.

Typically, voice names in text-to-speech systems are structured to reflect the language, accent, and sometimes the gender of the voice. For example, names might be structured like "en-US-Wavenet-A" or "en-GB-Standard-D", where the first part indicates the language and country code, followed by the type of voice model, and then a specific identifier for the voice.

To get the exact list of voice names available in the `tts-1` model, you would need to refer to the OpenAI API documentation or query the API directly, as it will provide the most up-to-date and specific information on available voices.
