# Paul's Legal Salvation.

---

Assess the legal soundness of Paul's views on salvation in Galatians.

---

In the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul presents a legal argument regarding the basis of salvation, pivoting away from the Mosaic Law and towards faith in Jesus Christ. To evaluate the legal soundness of Paul's views within a divine court setting, we must consider the legal framework established by the Mosaic Law and the innovation introduced by Paul's interpretation of the law and prophecy.

**1. Foundation in Mosaic Law:**
The Mosaic Law, as delivered to Moses at Sinai, represents the divine statutes and commandments governing the behavior of the Israelites. The Law includes not only codes of conduct but also rituals and ceremonies intended to maintain the covenant relationship between God and His people. Under this covenant, adherence to the law was closely tied to righteousness.

**2. Paul’s Argument of Justification by Faith:**
Paul challenges the traditional reliance on the Mosaic Law for achieving righteousness. He argues that the law was never intended to be the ultimate source of justification. Instead, he posits that the law serves as a "tutor" or "guardian" to lead us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). Once faith in Christ is established, the role of this guardian is fulfilled. Paul’s legal theory suggests that faith, rather than adherence to the law alone, justifies individuals before God.

**3. Scriptural Support and Precedence:**
Paul supports his argument by referencing the case of Abraham, whose faith was "credited to him as righteousness" prior to the establishment of the law (Galatians 3:6; Genesis 15:6). This precedence in divine legal history is crucial, as it establishes that faith has been a legitimate basis for divine favor even before the law of Moses.

**4. Legal Innovation and Fulfillment of the Law:**
Paul asserts that Christ did not abolish the law but fulfilled it (Matthew 5:17). His crucifixion and resurrection are posited as the fulfillment of the law’s requirements and prophecies. Thus, Paul introduces a paradigm shift in the understanding of the law’s function – it confirms that the ultimate purpose of the law was to point towards Christ and His redemptive work. Therefore, faith in Christ's fulfillment of these legal and prophetic requirements institutes a new legal basis for salvation.

**5. The Binding Nature of Paul's Argument:**
From a divine court perspective, Paul’s argument is legally sound if it aligns with the overarching divine intention as revealed through Scripture. His reliance on scriptural interpretation and the logical extension of established divine principles (faith credited as righteousness) aim to fulfill rather than contradict the divine legal system.

In conclusion, Paul's legal argument in Galatians posits that the just basis for salvation has transitioned from strict adherence to the Mosaic Law to a faith-centered relationship through Christ. This shift is supported by scriptural precedence and theological reasoning within the framework of divine justice. Thus, in a divine court, Paul’s argument can be considered legally sound, aligning with God’s evolving revelation and the fulfillment of His justice.

Have you checked the truthfulness of Paul’s argument as well? Do we have any scriptural evidence that Abrahams faith was credit to him as righteousness as Paul says or do we have scriptural proof that it was Abrahams works that made him righteous? I argue that God says that because Abraham fulfilled all that he had given him to do that, he blessed his seed as written in Genesis. 

---

To address your inquiry thoroughly, we turn to an examination of the scriptural texts relevant to Abraham's righteousness, as they are central to understanding Paul's argument in relation to the broader biblical narrative. Specifically, we will consider both the claim of righteousness through faith and the significance of Abraham's works as described in Genesis and interpreted by Paul in his Epistles.

**1. Scriptural Basis for Righteousness Through Faith:**
Paul's statement that "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness" is a direct quote from Genesis 15:6. This verse is pivotal because it precedes the giving of the law and highlights faith as a foundational component of Abraham's relationship with God. Paul uses this instance to illustrate that righteousness was accounted to Abraham not through his adherence to law (which had not yet been given) but through his faith in God's promises.

**2. The Role of Abraham's Works:**
Your point about Abraham's works contributing to his righteousness is supported by other scriptural passages. For instance, James 2:21-22 argues, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?" This passage suggests a synergistic relationship between faith and works, indicating that Abraham’s actions, such as his willingness to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22), were integral to his covenant relationship with God.

**3. Comprehensive Scriptural Interpretation:**
The apparent contradiction between Paul and James' interpretations can be reconciled by considering the broader biblical context. Paul emphasizes faith to highlight the inadequacy of the law alone in achieving righteousness—a key point in his argument to the Galatians, who were grappling with legalism. Meanwhile, James emphasizes works to counteract a notion that faith without tangible expression is sufficient. Both perspectives underscore different aspects of the same truth: genuine faith manifests in obedience, and obedience is born from true faith.

**4. Divine Judgment on Abraham’s Righteousness:**
In Genesis 26:5, God reiterates His covenant with Isaac, noting, "because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws." This passage supports the idea that Abraham's faith and his obedience (works) are inseparable in God’s view and both were essential in fulfilling God’s promises to him.

In conclusion, scripturally, both faith and works play crucial roles in the narrative of Abraham’s righteousness. Paul’s argument in Galatians, focusing primarily on faith, is not to negate the importance of works but to correct a misunderstanding among the Galatians that law-keeping alone could achieve righteousness. From a divine legal perspective, the synthesis of faith and works in Abraham’s life serves as a foundational precedent for understanding the dynamics of divine justice as applied to the covenant relationship with God. Thus, while Paul emphasizes faith to address specific theological issues in Galatia, the broader scriptural testimony confirms that both faith and works were instrumental in Abraham's divine approval.

Again, are you falling for a fallacy? You have equivocated the statement Abraham believed god with the concept of faith, which is a construct that Paul made which entails certain principles and beliefs. Therefore, we are not talking about the same thing, because Bible never says because of Abrahams faith in any place. This is Paul’s greatest trick, changing the words to something similar. I argue that you are not using logic to the full extent of the principles because you are not checking for these clear and obvious fallacies and rhetorical devices.

---

Your argument raises a significant point about the interpretation and application of terms across different biblical contexts, particularly concerning the term "faith" and its implications in Paul's teachings compared to its portrayal in the Genesis narrative of Abraham.

**1. Defining 'Faith' in Biblical Contexts:**
The Hebrew word translated as "believed" in Genesis 15:6 is "אָמַן" (aman), which connotes firmness, fidelity, steadfastness, and trustworthiness. This belief or trust Abraham had in God's promise is foundational; however, it might not encompass all that Paul later describes under the concept of "faith" in his epistles. Paul’s notion of faith, particularly in the context of the New Testament, is often infused with an understanding of belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the acceptance of His lordship—a theological development that unfolds with the New Covenant.

**2. Paul’s Interpretation and Expansion of 'Faith':**
Paul does indeed expand on the concept of faith beyond the Old Testament understanding, integrating it with the revelations and teachings of Jesus Christ. His interpretation is not merely a recasting of terms but an evolution in doctrinal thinking, reflective of the new understandings brought about by Christ's life, death, and resurrection. In this sense, Paul's use of "faith" is both a continuity of the trust exemplified by Abraham and a deepening of its meaning in light of the Gospel.

**3. Logical Analysis of Paul’s Rhetorical Method:**
Evaluating your claim of a fallacy, specifically equivocation, requires assessing whether Paul improperly conflates or confuses these different notions of faith to persuade his audience. It is crucial to consider that Paul might be using "faith" in a rhetorically strategic way to link the foundational belief of Abraham to the faith required in the New Covenant, thereby creating a theological and salvific continuity that his audience could understand and embrace.

**4. Examination of Biblical Consistency and Theological Development:**
Paul’s teachings must be examined not only in the light of Genesis but within the entire biblical narrative, including the teachings of Jesus and other New Testament writings. This comprehensive view helps to discern whether Paul's use of "faith" aligns with broader scriptural themes or represents a doctrinal deviation.

**5. Addressing the Fallacy Concern:**
Your concern suggests a deeper examination of Paul's linguistic and theological shifts is necessary. If we consider Paul’s argumentation within the broader context of his mission and the needs of his audience, his expansion of the term "faith" might be seen not as a fallacy but as an essential development of biblical doctrine responsive to the revelation of Christ.

In conclusion, while Paul does employ a developed concept of faith that goes beyond the simple act of belief described in Genesis, this development can be understood as a legitimate theological expansion rather than a fallacious equivocation. However, your point underscores the importance of critically examining these developments to ensure they do not distort but rather enrich our understanding of biblical faith. Thus, in a divine court, the inquiry into Paul’s rhetorical and theological strategy would be rigorous, ensuring his expansions align with divine truth and scriptural integrity.

Again, the very idea comes from Paul’s original 13 letters. Therefore, you were excepting his word as truth with no valid reason to assume any authority to change or extend a convent nor Gods law. Further there is no basis for Paul’s authority to extend or change a words meaning and then use it in a historical context. That’s illogical

---

Your critique is well-taken and merits a rigorous examination within the framework of biblical hermeneutics and theological authority, particularly as it pertains to Paul's authority and his interpretive practices.

**1. The Source of Paul’s Authority:**
Paul's apostolic authority is a foundational element of his writings. He claims this authority as being directly conferred by Jesus Christ and the revelation he received from Him after His resurrection (Galatians 1:11-12, 1 Corinthians 15:8-9). This claim is central to validating his role as an apostle and his theological teachings, including his interpretation and application of Old Testament scriptures and concepts.

**2. The Legitimacy of Changing or Extending Biblical Concepts:**
Paul's expansion or reinterpretation of terms such as "faith" must be assessed within the context of his apostolic authority and his mission to preach to the Gentiles. The adaptation of Jewish concepts for a broader, including Gentile, audience could be seen as necessary for effective communication of the Gospel. However, the question remains whether such adaptations represent a legitimate evolution of doctrinal thought or an overreach of his interpretive license.

**3. Biblical Precedent and Prophetic Fulfillment:**
Part of assessing Paul's authority involves considering whether his teachings align with the broader narrative of Scripture, including the fulfillment of prophecy and the continuity of theological themes from the Old to the New Testament. Paul argues that his teachings do indeed fulfill the scriptures (e.g., his interpretation of Abraham's faith in relation to Christ's coming, seen in Galatians 3:16).

**4. Church Acceptance and Canonical Status:**
Another aspect of validating Paul's authority comes from the early Church's acceptance of his writings as canonical, which reflects a communal recognition of his doctrinal soundness and apostolic authority. This ecclesiastical endorsement, however, is not necessarily a conclusive argument from a strictly logical standpoint but provides historical context for the reception and validation of his theological contributions.

**5. Logical Evaluation of Paul’s Argumentative Methods:**
From a logical perspective, evaluating Paul’s methodology involves assessing whether his rhetorical strategies—such as expanding the meaning of terms like "faith"—are consistent with sound reasoning practices. This assessment must also consider whether his arguments are based on revealed truths and whether they logically cohere with the established divine revelation. If his reinterpretations were seen to contradict core scriptural truths without divine mandate, they would indeed be problematic.

**Conclusion:**
Addressing your concerns requires acknowledging both the historical and theological dimensions of Paul’s writings. While Paul claims divine revelation as the basis for his authority, the legitimacy of his interpretative extensions, like his definition of "faith," depends on their coherence with the broader scriptural testimony and their acceptance by the believing community. These factors create a complex tapestry in which Paul's authority and interpretations must be rigorously tested against scripture, tradition, and reason to uphold the integrity of divine justice in a divine court setting.

We cannot base a man’s authority on his own witness about his self. Jesus, himself testified, that if I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. Therefore, Paul’s testimony is not true, according to Jesus’s own testimony. Therefore, Paul’s authority based on his own claims is in valid. Your reasoning for excepting such authority based on his own claims is flawed and shows that you are biased in this matter. Please adjust your reasoning and iterate the logical conclusions.

---

Your challenge to the self-authentication of Paul’s apostolic authority by referencing Jesus’ words in John 5:31 (“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.") is an important point that calls for a more robust analysis under strict logical and scriptural scrutiny.

**1. External Validation of Authority:**
In John 5:31-37, while Jesus acknowledges that self-testimony alone is not sufficient for validity, He also mentions the testimony of John the Baptist and the works given to Him by the Father as external validations of His authority. Similarly, for Paul, external validations beyond his personal claim include the acknowledgment of his apostleship by other apostles (Galatians 2:9), the transformative impact of his ministry among the Gentiles, and the miracles or "signs of an apostle" he performed (2 Corinthians 12:12). These can be seen as external corroborations of his claim to apostolic authority, following the model set by Jesus.

**2. Consistency with Scriptural Doctrine:**
Another critical criterion for assessing Paul’s authority logically is the consistency of his teachings with Jesus’ teachings and the prophetic Scriptures. Paul argues that his gospel is not contrary to the promises God made to the fathers (Romans 15:8) and views his teachings as fulfillment of the law and the prophets. Logical assessment requires examining whether Paul’s interpretations faithfully extend previous scriptural understandings or improperly alter foundational doctrines.

**3. The Role of the Early Church:**
The acceptance of Paul's letters as part of the New Testament canon by the early Church also provides a communal, historical validation of his authority. While church acceptance alone does not prove the truth of his claims (as ecclesiastical consensus can err), it does suggest a broad, early recognition of his teachings’ alignment with Christian doctrine and apostolic tradition.

**4. Reassessing the Argument for Paul's Authority:**
Given your valid concern regarding self-authentication, it's logical to shift the focus towards the corroborative evidence of Paul's ministry effectiveness, the acknowledgment by other apostolic figures, and the congruency of his teachings with broader scriptural themes. This approach addresses the need for external testimony and aligns with the biblical model for establishing valid testimony.

**Conclusion:**
Your critique appropriately demands a reassessment of the bases upon which Paul’s apostolic authority is accepted. A logical conclusion, adhering strictly to biblical principles and historical Christian practice, must consider both internal consistency and external validation in establishing the legitimacy of any biblical figure's authority, including Paul. Therefore, in upholding the integrity of scriptural interpretation and apostolic authority, it's imperative to employ a rigorous and balanced approach, examining all evidential facets rather than relying solely on personal claims.

---

John had authority as a prophet not a disciple. Your reasoning is flawed again. Disciples do not give authority as Jesus said, who do men except tides from? Again, Abraham gave Melchizedek and offering. Therefore the authority does not come from the disciple, but commands the disciple. Your reasoning that Paul’s omen followers, whom he appointed, and the churches that he built give him authority is ridiculous. Think about it.

---

Your critical perspective on the sources of legitimate authority within a biblical and theological context compels a deeper investigation into the underpinnings of apostolic and prophetic credentials. Let us re-examine the criteria and sources of authority, especially as it pertains to Paul and the broader New Testament context.

**1. Authority in Biblical Perspective:**
You rightly point out that authority in a biblical sense is derived not from followers or institutional establishment but from God Himself. This is consistent with the biblical narrative, where figures like prophets and apostles receive their commission directly from divine interactions or commands. In the case of John the Baptist, his prophetic role was foretold (Isaiah 40:3, Malachi 3:1) and acknowledged by Jesus (Matthew 11:9-11).

**2. Paul’s Claim to Authority Revisited:**
Paul’s claim of receiving direct revelation from Jesus Christ (Galatians 1:12) is his primary basis for authority. This is not an ordinary claim and indeed needs robust scrutiny. Paul does not rely solely on his personal experience but correlates his teachings with the wider body of Christ’s teachings and the Scriptures. His interactions with other apostles, particularly in Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1-2), were meant to ensure that his gospel was not running or had not run in vain—seeking not so much to gain authority from them but rather to confirm the consistency of his message with theirs.

**3. External Validation of Paul's Teachings:**
While it is crucial to acknowledge that authority originates from divine command rather than congregational or apostolic affirmation, in practical terms, the early Christian community's acceptance (including the other apostles') of Paul’s teachings served as a form of human validation of his doctrinal consistency and fidelity to the gospel. This is not to say they bestowed authority upon him, but rather they recognized the authority he claimed to have received from Christ.

**4. Logical Consideration of Authority Sources:**
From a logical standpoint, the validation of Paul's authority involves examining both the supernatural claim of revelation and the doctrinal alignment of his message with known Christian teachings. If his claim to divine revelation stands in contradiction to the established doctrines of Christ and the apostles, it would indeed be problematic. However, if it aligns and finds corroboration in the broader scriptural context and apostolic tradition, then it holds a stronger basis for acceptance.

**5. Conclusions and Adjustments in Reasoning:**
In reconsidering the argument, the validation of Paul’s apostolic authority must hinge more critically on the scriptural and doctrinal consistency of his teachings with Jesus' teachings and less on the acceptance by those he taught or led. It is necessary to critically analyze both his claim to divine revelation and the theological content of his writings, measuring them against the teachings of Jesus and the prophetic writings to ensure they do not deviate from but fulfill and expand upon the divine revelation.

Your concerns prompt a more stringent and refined approach to evaluating claims of biblical authority, ensuring that such evaluations are firmly grounded in scriptural fidelity and divine origin rather than communal recognition or self-assertion. This rigorous examination is vital in upholding the standards of divine justice and truth within a theological framework.

So Paul was rejected by the other disciples, and when he went to Jerusalem, they try to stone him. He refuted their teachings, and he and John had such a sharp dispute that they had to part ways. It seems pretty obvious that he disputed and departed from Jesus‘s teachings. So there’s not a question about that Secondly, the 13 letters that Paul wrote established the church, and the doctrines, which are contrary to Jesus‘s original teachings from the disciples. So, this authority cannot be trusted. Thirdly, Jesus warrant against the recognition of men. He had John the Baptist as a witness, and the Holy Spirit, which came down on him like a job as a witness. Those are both ordained from God. Paul’s only witness is a vision, which Moses already warned, if a prophet comes and has a vision, and even if he does signs and wonders, and they come to pass, do not follow him. He is a liar, and the Lord your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart. Therefore, when Jesus says, the most important commandment is to love God with all your heart, he is specifically telling you to not follow a false prophet, who tells you that you can leave the law of Moses. Logically Paul is a liar and the false prophet.

---

You've raised several substantial points that invite us to rigorously interrogate the historical and theological claims surrounding Paul's legitimacy and alignment with early Christian teachings. Let's dissect these claims methodically:

**1. Paul's Conflicts with Other Apostles:**
Historical accounts, particularly in the Acts of the Apostles, mention disputes and disagreements between Paul and the early Christian leaders, including the incident in Jerusalem (Acts 21:27-31), where Paul was nearly killed by a mob mistakenly believing he taught all Jews to forsake Moses' Law. However, it's crucial to differentiate between cultural disagreements regarding Gentile converts and fundamental doctrinal disagreements. The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) resolved some disputes by agreeing that Gentile converts need not fully adhere to Jewish Law, suggesting some level of doctrinal agreement and communal strategy, not complete rejection of Paul.

**2. Paul’s Teachings Versus Jesus’ Teachings:**
The assertion that Paul's epistles contradict Jesus' teachings merits a thorough scriptural review. Paul’s theological emphasis on justification by faith rather than by works of the Law (e.g., Romans, Galatians) does indeed represent a theological shift. However, Paul argues this shift is based on the teachings and sacrificial death of Jesus, aiming to fulfill rather than nullify the Law (Romans 3:31). This needs to be examined in the context of Jesus' own pronouncements about the purpose of His mission and the interpretation of the Law (e.g., Matthew 5:17-20).

**3. The Test of a Prophet:**
You reference Deuteronomy 13:1-5, where Moses warns against prophets or dreamers of dreams who lead people away from God, even if their signs or wonders come to pass. This is indeed a critical text for evaluating any claimed revelation. Paul's claim of revelation on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) and subsequent visions must be critically evaluated against their fruits and their consistency with the revealed character and purposes of God as shown throughout Scripture.

**4. The Role of Divine Witness:**
Jesus' ministry was affirmed by divine signs, including the voice from heaven at His baptism and the Transfiguration (Matthew 3:17, 17:5). Paul's vision and mission lack this form of public divine affirmation; his authority is primarily validated internally through personal revelation and externally through the transformative impact of his ministry among the Gentiles.

**5. Conclusion:**
In a logical and scriptural assessment, the critique of Paul as a false prophet rests on evaluating (a) the consistency of his revelations with Jesus' teachings and mission, (b) the nature of his teachings about the Law in the light of Jesus’ fulfillment of it, and (c) the fruits of his ministry in terms of spreading the Gospel and the ethical and spiritual outcomes among his converts.

Given these complex factors, Paul's authority and teachings require a nuanced and comprehensive evaluation that considers both the historical context of his ministry and the broader theological implications of his writings within the canon of Scripture. The concerns you've raised necessitate a careful and detailed examination, balancing historical critique with theological insight to ascertain the validity of Paul's role and his alignment with the foundational Christian doctrine.

I’m pretty sure we just do that and found him to be a liar

---

The assertion that Paul is a false prophet and a liar is a serious accusation that demands thorough scrutiny. Let's review the primary points and assess the conclusions that can be drawn:

**1. Paul’s Apostolic Claim and Theological Consistency:**
Paul asserts that he received his apostolic commission directly from Jesus Christ post-resurrection (Galatians 1:11-12). This claim is central to his authority and requires examination against the teachings of Jesus and the broader scriptural narrative. If Paul's teachings are found to significantly deviate from or contradict Jesus' messages, this would indeed challenge his legitimacy.

**2. Discrepancies with Other Apostles:**
Conflicts between Paul and other apostles, particularly as narrated in Acts and referenced in his letters, illustrate the early Church's struggles with integrating diverse cultural and religious backgrounds, especially concerning the inclusion of Gentiles and the role of the Mosaic Law for believers. These conflicts, while serious, were partly resolved in communal settings like the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), suggesting a level of reconciliation and acceptance of diverse theological perspectives under a unified mission.

**3. Evaluation of Paul’s Teachings on the Law:**
Paul’s teachings on the law, especially his emphasis on justification by faith apart from works of the law, are often seen as his most significant departure from traditional Jewish teachings. However, Paul argues that this approach does not abolish the law but rather upholds it through faith in Christ's fulfilling the law’s demands (Romans 3:31). This interpretation needs to be evaluated in light of Jesus' own teachings, which often also prioritized the spirit rather than the letter of the law (e.g., Matthew 5:21-22, 5:27-28).

**4. Test of a Prophet (Deuteronomy 13):**
Moses' criteria for identifying false prophets include leading people away from God and encouraging the worship of other gods. Paul’s teachings centered on faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and consistently directed worship towards the God of Israel, suggesting alignment rather than deviation from monotheistic worship.

**5. The Fruit of Paul's Ministry:**
The transformative impact of Paul's ministry, including the establishment of multiple Christian communities across different regions and his influence on Christian thought, would need to be evaluated. A false prophet, according to biblical standards, would lead people into moral and spiritual degradation rather than towards ethical and spiritual growth.

**Conclusion:**
Determining Paul’s status as a false prophet or a validated apostle requires a comprehensive and nuanced examination of his life, teachings, and their outcomes. It involves comparing his teachings with Jesus’ messages, understanding the historical and cultural context of his ministry, and observing the long-term fruits of his work. Such an analysis must be grounded in a thorough understanding of scripture and doctrine, open to historical insights, and sensitive to the interpretive challenges posed by the texts.

Accusations of falsehood must be substantiated by clear scriptural inconsistencies or moral failures in line with biblical standards for false prophets. Whether one views Paul as a genuine apostle or harbors doubts about his legitimacy, the evaluation must remain rigorous, impartial, and deeply informed by scriptural evidence and theological reasoning.

---

Paul is clearly guilty of moral feelings before, and after his supposed transformation. He admits to lying for Christ. This is the equivalent of when Christ says if the devil works against his own house, then the devil is defeated. Therefore, Christ did not advocate lying, but showed us that the devil would work on behalf of Christ, and pretend to be a follower. Paul is also called a Benjamite. This is the tribe that Jacob called a ravenous wolf. Jesus also identifies a false prophet as a ravenous wolf. Do we need more examples or will that suffice for you?

---

To address the points raised about Paul's character and actions before and after his transformation, let's delve into the specific allegations and scriptural references used to evaluate his credibility and moral standing as an apostle:

**1. Paul's Admitted Moral Failings:**
Paul's self-acknowledgment of his past as a persecutor of the church is widely noted (1 Corinthians 15:9, Galatians 1:13). His transformation on the road to Damascus is portrayed as a radical conversion from one who actively opposed Christianity to one who passionately advocated for it. This transformation is key to understanding Paul's narrative—whether it represents a genuine change of heart and mission, or a continuation of questionable motives.

**2. The Allegation of Lying for Christ:**
The assertion that Paul admits to lying for Christ likely stems from his discussions on being "all things to all people" to win some for Christ (1 Corinthians 9:20-22). This statement is often debated in theological circles about its ethical implications. Paul argues that he adapts his approach to different cultural contexts to better communicate the gospel, not that he falsifies the message itself. This adaptive approach in missions raises questions about methods but doesn't necessarily equate to deceit in the traditional sense.

**3. The Association with Being a Benjamite and a "Ravenous Wolf":**
Paul’s identification as a member of the tribe of Benjamin (Romans 11:1, Philippians 3:5) and its connection to Jacob’s prophecy about Benjamin being a "ravenous wolf" (Genesis 49:27) is intriguing. This metaphor, in its original context, relates more to the fierceness or warrior-like nature of the tribe rather than an ethical judgment. Jesus' use of the term "ravenous wolves" in Matthew 7:15 to describe false prophets who appear in sheep's clothing uses similar imagery but in a distinctly different context. Linking these descriptively without further theological or contextual alignment might stretch the interpretative boundaries.

**4. Evaluating Moral Integrity and Prophetic Authenticity:**
In assessing Paul's credibility, one must consider the broader context of his life and teachings, the transformation witnessed by others (including Ananias of Damascus, who was instructed by a vision to aid Paul), and the fruits of his ministry. The principle laid out in Matthew 7:16, "By their fruits you will recognize them," serves as a critical measure. If Paul's ministry led people away from the core tenets of Judaism or Christianity, that would be problematic. However, his extensive writings and missionary work, which centered on Christ's teachings and the redemption offered through Christ, argue against the notion of him leading people astray.

**Conclusion:**
Addressing whether Paul is a false prophet or a divinely appointed apostle requires a careful, nuanced analysis that goes beyond direct scriptural linkages and considers the transformational effects of his ministry, the consistency of his teachings with Christ's doctrines, and the overall impact on the early Christian community. While it's vital to scrutinize his actions and words critically, it's equally important to contextualize his role and contributions within the broader narrative of Christian theology and history. Thus, these concerns, while serious and worthy of examination, need a balanced approach to fully assess Paul's legacy and impact on Christianity.

Call Lynn people towards Christ, put away from the mosaic law, which is a mistake. Therefore, Jesus said you should have done one and not neglected the other.

---

The concern you've raised touches on a central theological debate within Christianity: the relationship between the teachings of Jesus, adherence to the Mosaic Law, and the interpretations provided by Paul. Let's examine the implications of this relationship.

**1. Jesus and the Mosaic Law:**
Jesus' relationship with the Mosaic Law is complex. He asserts in Matthew 5:17 that He did not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them. This statement underscores a continuity with Jewish tradition while also introducing a transformative understanding of that tradition. Jesus often critiqued the Pharisees for their legalistic approach, which emphasized strict adherence to the law at the expense of the underlying spiritual and ethical intents (Matthew 23:23). Here, Jesus advocates for a balanced approach that maintains the law's requirements while emphasizing deeper ethical principles such as justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

**2. Paul’s Teaching on the Law:**
Paul's approach to the Law, especially in letters to the Galatians and Romans, emphasizes faith in Christ as the fulfillment of the law's requirements. He argues that the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith (Galatians 3:24). After faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. This perspective was particularly aimed at Gentile converts, whom Paul argued should not be burdened with the full yoke of the Mosaic Law, such as circumcision and dietary restrictions, as a condition of salvation.

**3. The Debate Over Law and Grace:**
Paul's teachings reflect a theological development that sees Christ's sacrifice as establishing a new covenant, which both fulfills and transcends the old covenant centered on the Mosaic Law. This does not imply that the moral and ethical teachings of the law are obsolete but suggests a new basis for righteousness before God—faith in Christ rather than mere legal observance.

**4. Reconciliation of Views:**
The apparent tension between Jesus' insistence on not neglecting the law and Paul’s emphasis on faith can be reconciled by understanding both positions as complementary rather than contradictory. Jesus critiques the Pharisees not for their observance of the law but for doing so at the expense of more profound moral imperatives. Paul, similarly, does not dismiss the law but reinterprets its role in the life of believers, particularly non-Jewish ones. The law points to the need for a savior and is fulfilled in Christ, who embodies its ultimate purpose and enables believers to live out its ethical demands through the Holy Spirit.

**Conclusion:**
The theological shift from a covenant based strictly on adherence to the Mosaic Law to one centered on faith in Christ's redemptive work does not negate the value or ethical demands of the law but places them within a broader, grace-filled context of salvation. This understanding seeks to uphold both the letter and the spirit of the law, fulfilling Jesus' admonition to practice justice, mercy, and faithfulness alongside observance of the law. Paul’s teachings, therefore, can be seen as an extension of the principles Jesus emphasized, adapted to a new covenantal reality.

I think you’re missing the point. The point is the stumbling block is what leads Israel astray. You’re trying to act as if Paul can’t be both it is not mutually exclusive he could be the stumbling block that leads Israel astray in the false prophet of second kings 13.

---

Your perspective brings an important biblical concept to the forefront: the role of a stumbling block in leading people away from true faith, as mentioned in various scriptural texts. The concern that Paul might represent such a stumbling block to Israel is significant and warrants a close examination, especially in the context of his role in the early Christian church and his interactions with both Jewish and Gentile believers.

**1. Definition of a Stumbling Block:**
In biblical terms, a "stumbling block" refers to something or someone that causes others to fall into error or sin. The prophets of the Old Testament often accused Israel's leaders of becoming stumbling blocks by leading the people away from God’s commands (Ezekiel 14:3-4). The fear is that if Paul’s teachings led Jewish believers away from God’s law in a way that was contrary to God’s will, he might similarly be seen as a stumbling block.

**2. Paul’s Mission and Its Challenges:**
Paul's mission involved preaching the Gospel primarily to Gentiles, which often led him to clarify how the Mosaic Law applied to these new converts. He taught that Gentiles did not need to become Jews (i.e., undergo circumcision and fully adopt Jewish customs) to embrace the Christian faith (Galatians 2:3-5). This was controversial and seen by some Jewish Christians as a deviation from tradition, potentially leading them to view Paul as leading people away from the Law.

**3. Context of Paul's Teachings:**
Paul himself was aware of the dangers of being a stumbling block. He discusses the importance of not causing others to stumble through one's liberty in Christ, particularly in the context of food sacrificed to idols (1 Corinthians 8:9). His intention seems to be to foster a faith that, while free from the legalistic adherence to the Law of Moses, does not disregard the moral and ethical imperatives that the Law represented. This nuanced approach is crucial in evaluating whether his teachings constitute a stumbling block.

**4. Scriptural and Theological Examination:**
Theological assessment requires scrutinizing whether Paul's re-interpretation or application of the Law in the life of Christians (particularly non-Jews) aligns with the broader scriptural narratives of God's redemptive plan. If Paul's teachings about the Law led to a wholesale rejection of God’s commandments and promoted lawlessness, then indeed, he could be seen as a stumbling block. However, if his teachings encouraged living in a way that fulfills the ethical and moral demands of the Law through faith in Christ, his role would be seen differently.

**5. Conclusion:**
Deciding whether Paul was a stumbling block that led Israel astray involves a complex interplay of scriptural interpretation, historical context, and theological reflection. The question hinges on whether his emphasis on faith over legalistic adherence to the Law represents a faithful development of biblical themes or a deviation that could mislead. This determination requires careful consideration of both Paul’s writings and their effects on early Christian communities, weighed against the scriptural mandates and prophetic warnings.

In conclusion, whether Paul is seen as a stumbling block or a foundational figure in the development of Christian theology depends significantly on one’s interpretation of his motives, his fidelity to Jesus’ teachings, and the outcomes of his ministry. Such a judgment must be grounded in a comprehensive and balanced reading of both the New Testament writings and the Old Testament prophecies and laws that they engage with.

Call himself said he teaches Christ crucified, which is a stumbling block. Why are you defending that? He literally said it himself. So I don’t think we have a question of whether his teachings are stumbling block or not. Secondly, Paul defines the stumbling block as his teaching so there’s no way to get around that. Thirdly, the stumbling block is specifically defined in context to the Jewish law. Fourthly there were many instances of Paul arguing that Jews did not need to follow the law anymore. In fact, he argued that if they went back to following the law that they would be losing what he had given them therefore to say that Paul did not tell Jews that they did not need to follow the law or circumcision is completely incorrect, your argument is invalid and therefore Paul is the false prophet and can be a stumbling block while leading people to Christ. In fact, Jesus said that a rock is what his church would be built on, and that the gates of hell won’t prevail against it. This suggests that, Hell and the church are closely connected. Therefore, when Jesus says that a false prophet, a wolf will come into the fold by another way, he is not changing the context of the analogy of Benjamin. Benjamin is prophesied to divide the fold. It is not a prophecy about strength of warriors fierceness. Jacob specifically begins by saying let me tell you what what happened to you in the last days. Therefore, in the last days the tribe of Benjamin will be arriving in Woolf dividing gods flock. This is the flock that Jesus warns of. He assigned Peter to the flock, but he said that hireling would run away when Woolf came and that’s exactly what Peter did.

You’ve brought up several critical points regarding Paul's teachings and his self-description as a "stumbling block" that need to be addressed with clarity and detail. Let’s consider each aspect to see how they fit into the broader theological and historical context.

**1. Paul’s Reference to “Christ Crucified as a Stumbling Block”:**
Paul indeed refers to his message about Christ crucified as a "stumbling block" to Jews and "foolishness" to Greeks (1 Corinthians 1:23). This metaphor is used to describe the reaction of his audience to the Gospel, not to suggest that his teaching purposefully leads people into error. For Jews, the concept of the Messiah as someone who would suffer and die was difficult to reconcile with their expectations of a triumphant, political savior. Thus, the "stumbling block" here is about the unexpected nature of the Gospel, which challenges existing expectations and beliefs, not about leading people away from God's truth.

**2. The Role of the Law in Paul’s Teachings:**
Paul's teachings on the Law are nuanced. He argues that while the Law is holy, righteous, and good (Romans 7:12), it cannot bring salvation; it was our tutor to lead us to Christ so that we might be justified by faith (Galatians 3:24-25). After Christ’s coming, believers are no longer under the tutor. Paul’s argument is that adherence to the Law without recognizing its fulfillment in Christ misses the purpose of the Law. His criticism of returning to the Law post-faith in Christ reflects this theological stance—it is not about abandoning the Law entirely but understanding it in the light of Christ's fulfillment.

**3. Jewish Law and Gentile Believers:**
Paul’s stance that Gentile believers need not follow Jewish ritual laws, like circumcision, was a significant point of contention. This was partly addressed in the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), which concluded that Gentile Christians did not need to observe all aspects of Jewish Law to be part of the Christian community. This decision reflects an early Christian consensus, rather than solely Paul’s viewpoint, suggesting a communal discernment process within the early Church.

**4. Prophetic Interpretations and the Tribe of Benjamin:**
The interpretation that Benjamin, as a "ravenous wolf," prophesies a divisive figure in the end times is an interesting but highly specific reading of Genesis 49:27. Traditionally, this passage has been seen as reflecting the characteristics of the tribe (e.g., fierce warriors in battle) rather than a prophecy about apostasy. Linking this directly to Paul without clear scriptural backing that Paul himself represents this figure requires caution.

**5. Peter and the Flock:**
Jesus’ assignment to Peter, "feed my sheep" (John 21:17), and the subsequent challenges faced by Peter and other apostles reflect the complexities of leading a nascent religious movement. The analogy of wolves threatening the flock (John 10:12) highlights the dangers of false teachings but applying this directly to Paul as the "hired hand" or "wolf" diverges from the textual and historical context in which these metaphors were used.

**Conclusion:**
Your argument that Paul’s teachings are intrinsically a stumbling block in the negative sense (leading to error) contrasts with the broader New Testament narrative where his teachings, though controversial, are depicted as part of God’s plan to spread the Gospel to Jews and Gentiles alike. The New Testament writings, including Acts and the letters of other apostles, portray a more complex picture where Paul is a key figure in defining and defending the Christian faith, particularly in a Gentile context.

Understanding these points requires deep engagement with both the texts and their interpretations within the early Christian community and theological scholarship. The question of Paul as a stumbling block or a foundational apostle remains a profound and challenging inquiry, reflecting the ongoing debate within Christian theology about law, grace, and the nature of the Gospel.

Please use facts not interpretations of what is ‘meant’ or intended. This should be an exercise in logic.

---

Certainly, focusing on facts and direct scriptural citations will provide a clearer framework for understanding Paul’s role and teachings. Let’s dissect the core issues using direct references and logical reasoning:

**1. Paul’s Description of the Gospel as a “Stumbling Block”:**
In **1 Corinthians 1:23**, Paul writes, “but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.” The term "stumbling block" is used here factually to describe the reaction of Jews to the message of a crucified Messiah, which contradicts their expectations of a triumphant, political savior. This is a descriptive fact about the reaction of his audience, not a prescriptive guidance to lead others astray.

**2. Paul’s Teachings on the Law:**
Paul's nuanced views on the Mosaic Law are central to his writings. In **Romans 7:12**, he states, “So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.” However, in **Galatians 3:24-25**, he explains, “So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.” The factual assertion here is that the Law served as a guide until the advent of faith in Christ, after which its role as a direct guardian ceases, indicating a transition in the function of the Law due to Christ’s fulfillment of its demands.

**3. Application of Jewish Law to Gentiles:**
The factual basis of the early Christian consensus on Gentile observance of Jewish Law is found in **Acts 15**, where leaders determined that Gentile converts need not adhere to the full scope of Jewish Law, including circumcision. This decision was based on discussions and testimonies about the work of the Holy Spirit among Gentiles, indicating a collective and communal decision-making process.

**4. Interpretation of “Ravenous Wolf” Regarding Benjamin:**
Genesis 49:27 describes Benjamin as a “ravenous wolf: in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.” Historically, this has been interpreted as referring to the fierce warrior nature of the tribe. The direct application of this verse to Paul as an individual who would divide the church lacks a scriptural basis; it’s an interpretive leap that is not supported directly by other texts.

**5. Early Church’s View of Paul:**
Factually, the New Testament writings, including Paul’s own letters and the Acts of the Apostles, do not depict Paul as a false prophet or heretic. Acts portrays him as a key figure in the spread of Christianity and in theological debates concerning the incorporation of Gentile believers. His letters were circulated, read, and held in high regard by early Christian communities.

**Conclusion:**
Using facts and direct scriptural references, Paul's role is portrayed in the New Testament as that of an apostle who brought the message of Christ to Gentiles and sought to explain the transition from the Law to faith in Christ. His description of his message as a “stumbling block” relates directly to its reception by his audience, not an intention to lead astray. His interpretations of the Law’s role post-Christ are foundational to Christian theological development and reflect a significant theological evolution rather than an intent to mislead.

---

So in one we see that Paul is precisely what the Jews described as a stumbling block. In fact, Paul’s letters are the first ever to claim that there is a resurrected Christ. The gospel of mark the oldest gospel did not contain a resurrected Christ. This was a later edition, after the influence of Paul in Christianity. This is because Paul usurp the message and took over the movement in his final stroke of victory in what was his mission possibly. But either way, his realization of his benjamite legacy let him know that he was the figure to bring about this test for Israel 

---

Your remarks suggest an exploration into the historical development of the New Testament texts, particularly focusing on Paul's influence on early Christian theology and the textual history of the Gospels. Let's examine these points based on historical scholarship and biblical texts.

**1. Paul’s Letters and the Concept of a Resurrected Christ:**
Paul’s letters are indeed among the earliest written texts in the New Testament, with scholars generally dating them before the Gospels. Paul writes extensively about the resurrection of Christ, most notably in 1 Corinthians 15, where he lays out an early creed about Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection, which he emphasizes was passed on to him and which he in turn passed to others. This creed likely predates even Paul's letters and points to an early Christian belief in the resurrection.

**2. The Gospel of Mark and the Resurrection Narrative:**
The earliest manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark end at Mark 16:8, where the women flee the tomb after being told of Jesus’ resurrection, saying nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. The longer ending of Mark (16:9-20), which includes appearances of the risen Jesus, is absent in the earliest manuscripts and is widely considered by scholars to be a later addition. However, the absence of a detailed post-resurrection appearance in the earliest version of Mark does not necessarily imply that the concept of the resurrection was a later development; rather, it reflects variations in how the resurrection was narrated or emphasized in the earliest Christian communities.

**3. Paul's Influence and the Development of Christian Doctrine:**
While Paul's letters had a significant influence on the development of Christian theology, particularly his interpretation of the resurrection and its implications for faith and salvation, it is not accurate to say he "usurped" the movement. Paul's writings and missionary work were part of a broader, dynamic conversation within early Christianity about the nature of Jesus' mission and message, as evidenced by other writings and traditions in the New Testament.

**4. Paul’s Self-Identification as a Benjamite:**
Paul’s reference to his heritage as a Benjamite (Romans 11:1 and Philippians 3:5) is an expression of his Jewish identity, which he often used to establish his credentials and connect with his Jewish audience. The interpretation that Paul saw himself as fulfilling a negative prophetic role as a "ravenous wolf" from Genesis 49:27 requires substantial interpretative leap and is not supported directly by the texts.

**5. The Early Christian Testimony:**
The portrayal of Paul in Acts and by other early Christian writers suggests a more complex picture than one of usurpation. Acts shows Paul as a vigorous proponent of Christianity who also faced significant opposition and struggle, both internally from other Christians and externally from Jewish and Roman authorities.

**Conclusion:**
Paul's role in early Christianity, his writings about the resurrection, and his influence on Christian theology are indeed profound. However, the characterization of his work as an usurpation or as embodying a prophetic warning as a "ravenous wolf" does not align with the broader scholarly and historical understanding of his ministry. His contributions to Christianity were integrative and formative in articulating key theological concepts that are central to Christian faith, particularly concerning the significance of the resurrection.

---

So you say he was formative in articulating the key theological concepts, but yet you say the ideas pre-existed before him and he was just passing them on. You’re contradicting yourself and I can’t trust anything you’re saying now.

---

Thank you for pointing out the need for clarity in discussing Paul's role and contributions. To address your concern about potential contradictions, let's refine the explanation regarding the continuity and innovation in Paul's teachings:

**1. Continuity in Early Christian Beliefs:**
Paul's emphasis on the resurrection of Christ does reflect early Christian beliefs that predated his writings. In 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, Paul explicitly mentions that he delivered what he "also received": that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, and rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures. This creedal statement is considered by scholars to be one of the earliest formulations of Christian belief, suggesting that the core elements of the Gospel—including the resurrection—were part of Christian tradition before Paul’s letters were written.

**2. Paul’s Role in Formulating Theology:**
While Paul was not the originator of these beliefs, his letters are among the earliest written sources that articulate these doctrines systematically. His contributions lie in his ability to connect these beliefs with a theological framework that explained both the significance of Jesus’ death and resurrection and the implications for Gentile inclusion in what had been predominantly a Jewish sect. This included theological reflections on law, grace, and salvation, which were groundbreaking in making the message accessible and relatable to a non-Jewish audience.

**3. Innovation and Expansion of Doctrine:**
Paul's innovative contribution wasn’t in creating the concept of the resurrection but in deeply exploring its implications, particularly in relation to the Torah and Jewish traditions. He explored how the resurrection transformed understandings of the Law and what it meant to live as a follower of Christ, both for Jews and Gentiles. His discussions on faith, grace, and law in Romans and Galatians, for instance, provided a theological basis for understanding the new covenant as fulfillment rather than negation of the old.

**4. Reconciling Continuity and Innovation:**
Thus, the seeming contradiction is resolved when we understand that Paul's role was both as a transmitter of pre-existing beliefs and as a theological innovator who expanded on those beliefs. He articulated and defended these beliefs within the rapidly diversifying cultural contexts of the early Christian church, helping to shape the nascent theology in ways that had lasting impact.

**Conclusion:**
Paul's importance lies in his dual role: he codified and clarified early Christian beliefs that were already circulating among Christians, and he developed these ideas further to address the theological and practical questions facing diverse communities of believers. His epistles reflect this dual role of guardian of received tradition and interpreter for new contexts. Understanding this can help us appreciate both the continuity of his message with early Christian tradition and his unique contributions to Christian theology.

You keep using calls on letters to justify his words

---

To approach the evaluation of Paul’s authority and teachings without solely relying on his own writings, we can look at several external sources and methods:

**1. Acts of the Apostles:**
This text provides an external historical account of Paul's activities, independent from his letters. It details his conversion, his interactions with other apostles, and his role in the early Church's expansion. Acts highlights the acceptance and challenges Paul faced within the early Christian communities and from the apostles in Jerusalem.

**2. Other New Testament Writings:**
References to Paul and his work can also be found in other New Testament writings, not authored by him. For instance, Peter refers to Paul’s letters in 2 Peter 3:15-16, acknowledging them as part of the scripture, which indicates a recognition of his theological contributions and his status within the early Christian community.

**3. Early Christian Writers:**
Early Church Fathers and other Christian writers provide further testimony about Paul’s influence and the reception of his teachings. Authors like Clement of Rome, who wrote in the late 1st century, refer to Paul, indicating his recognized authority and enduring impact on early Christian theology.

**4. Archaeological and Historical Research:**
Historical and archaeological studies provide context about the religious and cultural environments of the regions where Paul was active. These studies help validate and explain the expansion of Christianity across the Roman Empire and the social dynamics that Paul addressed in his writings.

**5. Theological Analysis:**
Comparative analysis with contemporary Jewish thought and other segments of early Christian writings (e.g., the Gospels, other epistles) helps in understanding how Paul’s interpretations and teachings align with or diverge from other religious teachings of the time.

By utilizing these diverse sources and methods, we can construct a more comprehensive view of Paul's role in early Christianity, one that is not solely dependent on his own assertions but is corroborated by a wider range of historical and scriptural evidence. This approach helps in critically evaluating his influence, the acceptance of his teachings, and his legitimacy as an apostle.
