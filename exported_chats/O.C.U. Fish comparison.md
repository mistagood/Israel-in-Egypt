Let's detail the story of O.C.U. Fish's birth, his mother, parentage, survival, rearage, and everything. We're going to look at this compared to Rachel, or actually Rachel and Bill, as they seem to be one person joined sometimes, but we'll look at their scenario, their circle. And we'll also include the idea of Leah as a rival female.

From the Mazzaroth text you uploaded, *O.C.U. Fish* (a poetic alias for **Ophiuchus / Ish ha-Nachash**, “the Man of the Serpent”) represents the hidden 13th sign — the one that dwells *outside* the normal circle of the twelve tribes. His “birth” and life story in Hebrew cosmology can be told like this:  

He is conceived between **Akrav (Scorpio/Gad)** and **Keshet (Sagittarius/Naphtali)**, where the ecliptic bends. The Sun brushes only his feet, never his crown; that boundary itself is his nativity. He emerges where death (Scorpio’s sting) and covenant (Sagittarius’ bow) meet — the place where the serpent bites the heel and the heel crushes the head 【6†Mazarroth†L31-L41】.  

His **mother** may be read as **Betulah (Virgo/Dinah)**, “the Virgin, the hidden feminine giving birth to the Fish” — the House of Joseph. In this symbolic lineage, Betulah births *Dagim (Pisces)* — Ephraim and Manasseh — but the spiritual current that animates them rises from Ish ha-Nachash himself 【6†Mazarroth†L55-L66】.  He is the spark of resurrection running through the body of Joseph: the serpent lifted on Moses’ staff, the power to heal what was poisoned.

His **fatherhood** is double: on one side the remnant of **Dan**, “the judge,” whose vengeance becomes idolatry (Libra/Moznayim); on the other, the priestly science of **Joseph**, who carries the serpent on the rod.  Thus Ophiuchus is the offspring of judgment and healing — a being born from the marriage of punishment and mercy.  

In the sky he **survives** outside the ecliptic band, towering above the rest.  The ancients saw that his feet dip into the path of the Sun while his head is among northern stars.  He is “resurrected” nightly as the serpent-bearer who stands upright while the twelve sink below; his posture is perpetual resistance against the fall.  

His **rearage** — his nurturing — comes from the tension between **Rachel and Bilhah**, mirrored in Betulah’s virgin motherhood.  Rachel, barren until divine remembrance, and Bilhah, the concubine made mother, together prefigure the split maternal nature of Ophiuchus: lawful yet outcast, pure yet branded.  Leah, by contrast, the fruitful rival, represents the twelve established signs that compete for Jacob’s affection; she is the regular circle of fertility that excludes the thirteenth.  Where Leah governs repetition, Rachel-Bilhah give birth to anomaly — the hidden child beyond measure.

So in summary:  
- **Birthplace:** the gap between Scorpio and Sagittarius, where death meets covenant.  
- **Motherhood:** Betulah/Virgo (Dinah-Joseph line) acting through Rachel-Bilhah’s archetype.  
- **Fatherhood:** Dan’s judgment joined to Joseph’s healing staff.  
- **Survival:** existence beyond the zodiacal circuit, representing resurrection over idolatry.  
- **Rivalry:** Leah and her twelve sons symbolize the established order he stands apart from.

This makes Ish ha-Nachash the *thirteenth son of heaven* — the forgotten brother who holds both the serpent and the cure.

I'm not asking you about the document. So, in the document, the information is wrong. It hasn't been updated yet. Ophiuchus actually represents Joseph. A resurrection. So, I mean, it's basically Jesus. But it's Joseph as the one who all the other constellations circle around his feet. Not circle around his feet, but his feet are in the ecliptic. While they are completely positioned on it, so he's north of it, so only his feet are there. So, it is the dream of Joseph where the sun and moon and the twelve constellations, or star systems, bow down to him. And so, being that they are circling in that, but only his feet are in it, that's the positioning as he towers north of the ecliptic belt. So, that's the true meaning of the sign of Ophiuchus. It is not associated with Dan. So, what I'm asking you about is the Greek mythology.

Locked in. I’ll give you the Greek-myth thread cleanly, while keeping your mapping: **Ish ha-Nachash (Ophiuchus/Joseph)** towering north of the ecliptic; only the feet graze the path where **Akrav (Scorpius)** and **Keshet (Sagittarius)** run.

# Ish ha-Nachash (Ophiuchus) in Greek myth

**Identity.** The Greeks read Ophiuchus as **Asklēpios (Asclepius)**, the healer—literally “the serpent-bearer” (ὀφιοῦχος), depicted grasping the separate constellation **Serpens** (split into *Serpens Caput* and *Serpens Cauda* by his body). citeturn0search1

**Parentage & upbringing.** Asclepius is the son of **Apollo** and **Coronis** (variants name **Arsinoe**). He’s fostered by the centaur **Chiron**, who teaches him medicine. citeturn0search5

**How the serpent teaches resurrection.** In the standard Roman-Greek telling (Hyginus’ *Astronomica*), Asclepius witnesses a **serpent revive another serpent with an herb**. He learns the secret and begins **bringing mortals back to life**—one version dramatizes this with the boy **Glaucus**; others say he restores **Hippolytus** or even **Orion**. citeturn0search4turn0search0turn0search8turn0search7

**Zeus, the thunderbolt, and the stars.** Fearing that universal immortality would upend the cosmic order, **Zeus strikes Asclepius with a thunderbolt**, then honors him by placing him among the stars—with the **serpent**. That’s the origin scene of **Ophiuchus + Serpens**. The medical staff symbol is the same serpent-rod tradition. citeturn0search4turn0search5

**Placement and stance (which fits your geometry).** Ancient sky-poets note Ophiuchus’ **feet over the Scorpion** and his hands wrestling the coils of Serpens, with the **Archer (Keshet/Sagittarius)** rising nearby—exactly the neighborhood you’re using. Aratus (3rd c. BCE) describes the **coil of the Serpent and the body of Ophiuchus** lifting with the **Bow**, while **Scorpius** raises the hero’s **hands**; later star-atlas art shows him **trampling the Scorpion**—the heel-and-sting visual you’ve been drawing on. citeturn0search2turn0search1

**Surrounds & names.** The brightest star **Rasalhague** means “head of the serpent-charmer” (Arabic), sitting at the northern crown of the figure—reinforcing that **the head is high north** while **the feet alone touch the ecliptic** where he tangles with **Akrav**. citeturn0search1

## Snap fit to your Joseph reading
- **Resurrection motif:** Asclepius’ core transgression is **reviving the dead**—the exact mythic payload you’re mapping onto **Joseph/Yeshu‘a** as a resurrection sign embodied in **Ish ha-Nachash**. citeturn0search4  
- **Positional logic:** Greek sources already paint him **standing over Scorpius** with action spilling toward **Sagittarius**; that’s consistent with your “head north / feet in the path” geometry and the dream in which **sun, moon, and the twelve** bow. citeturn0search2turn0search1

If you want deeper text-critical granularity next, we can line-quote Aratus and Hyginus against a star map annotated with **Ish ha-Nachash / Akrav / Keshet** labels to lock the positional claims to the ancient lines.

Okay, so what I'm trying to look at is the mothers and their birth circumstances, birth from resurrection, death of mothers, so forth. That's what I'm trying to get to here.

---



---

Right—so what you’re drawing out is the *maternal pattern* behind the resurrection myth.  
Let’s look at that pattern through the Greek story of Ophiuchus (Asclepius) and the Hebrew pattern of Joseph together. Both birthlines pivot on the same motif: **the mother dies or is consumed, and from that death the child of healing or resurrection emerges**.

---

### Greek line: Coronis and Asclepius
Asclepius’ mother, **Coronis**, is a mortal woman loved by **Apollo**.  
While pregnant, she betrays him with a mortal man, **Ischys**. A raven brings the news to Apollo. In anger—or by Artemis’ hand—Coronis is **struck dead by divine fire or arrows**.  
Apollo, regretting it, **rescues the unborn child from her burning body** and gives him to the centaur **Chiron** to raise.  
So the healer of death is literally *born out of his mother’s pyre*. His first breath follows his mother’s death.  

That’s why he carries the secret of resurrection: his very birth is a resurrection scene—*life drawn out of the ashes of judgment*. His mother’s name, “Coronis,” means “crow” or “garland,” a ring—echoing the **solar corona**, light around darkness.  

---

### Hebrew line: Rachel (and Bilhah) and Joseph
Joseph’s birth follows Rachel’s long barrenness.  
Genesis 30:22–24 says “God remembered Rachel” and she conceived. In Hebrew thought, to be remembered after sterility is a form of **resurrection**—life from the dead womb.  
Later, Rachel dies giving birth to Benjamin. Her own line ends in death at the moment of fruitfulness, just as Coronis does.  

Bilhah, her maid, stands as Rachel’s living substitute—a kind of *Chiron figure*, raising Rachel’s sons when Rachel herself cannot. Through Bilhah’s body Rachel’s household is preserved.  

Thus Joseph’s lineage, like Asclepius’, comes through a mother who dies or is barren, and a second parent who becomes the nurse and teacher. Both children are **drawn out**—Joseph from the pit and prison, Asclepius from the pyre. Both bring restoration to their people.  

---

### Leah’s contrast
Leah, the rival sister, is fruitful from the start. Her motherhood is steady, not miraculous. She represents the **twelve ordinary houses**, the natural fertility of the ecliptic. Rachel–Bilhah, by contrast, is the extraordinary birth outside the pattern—the *thirteenth principle*, producing the redeemer who rises beyond the circle.  

---

### Synthesis
So:  
- **Coronis dies → Asclepius born of fire → resurrection healer.**  
- **Rachel dies / Bilhah fosters → Joseph survives → savior of his brothers.**  
- **Leah lives → twelve tribes / ordinary cycle.**  

Both mythic mothers embody *the womb that passes through death*.  
Both sons become mediators of life—one in medicine, one in providence.  
And in the sky, **Ophiuchus’ feet in the ecliptic and head above** show that same dynamic: one part within mortality, the other raised beyond it.

From this vantage, every resurrection myth is a maternal story: the mother’s body becomes the gate through which death is converted back into life.

Okay so what we're looking at here again is the motifs of jealousy. Okay so there's a jealousy between Rachel and Leah just as Koronis gives jealousy, or there's a jealousy between Apollo, right? And so Apollo's jealous of another man, so it's the same thing but reversed, is that there's a jealousy between the two women, the two wives here. And then we see that God is involved in both of the saving or bringing about a child from the person who has a dead womb, so God remembers Rachel, so that's a specific hand in her birth, and Koronis is impregnated by a God, which by the way also goes to the descendant of Joseph, Jesus, with Mary's story where she's married to a man, and then he finds out that she is impregnated by someone else, so the motif is reversed again, so now it's not Apollo who gets her pregnant, but it's, you know, another man, and he's gonna put her away, but the child is from a God, and so it's the same thing. He's saved from that, and so it's like we see that recurring thing, so that's what I'm kind of looking at through all of this. Not so much of Bilhah raising her children or teaching them, because that's not factual. It's not anything that we know or even have considered. It doesn't even align with our true purpose here.

Got it—focus on the jealousy-and-birth motif, stripped to what’s textual and pattern-true. Here’s the clean spine you’re tracing, with your mapping fixed: **Ish ha-Nachash (Ophiuchus) = Joseph**, feet in the ecliptic near **Akrav (Scorpius)** and **Keshet (Sagittarius)**, head north above the band.

# Core motif: jealousy → threatened lineage → divine intervention → child of destiny

## 1) Rachel–Leah (Genesis)
- **Jealousy vector:** Woman ↔ woman. Leah’s early fruitfulness and Jacob’s preference for Rachel generate reciprocal envy (Gen 29–30).
- **Threat to lineage:** Rachel’s **barrenness** functions as a social–covenant crisis (no heir through the loved wife).
- **Divine intervention:** “God **remembered** Rachel” (Gen 30:22–24) → **Joseph** is conceived—life from a “dead” womb.
- **Aftershock of jealousy:** Rachel later **dies in childbirth** with Benjamin (Gen 35:16–20)—life and loss braided.
- **Astral echo:** Joseph’s dream (sun+moon+12 bow) anticipates **Ish ha-Nachash** towering north, **only the feet** crossing the ecliptic—honor without full incorporation into the belt.

## 2) Coronis–Apollo–Ischys (Greek)
- **Jealousy vector:** Man ↔ man (Apollo vs. Ischys) over Coronis.
- **Threat to lineage:** Coronis is **killed** while pregnant (versions: Artemis or Apollo). The heir is about to be lost in judgment.
- **Divine intervention:** Apollo **rescues** the unborn **Asclepius** from the pyre; Chiron rears him. Birth is literally carved from death.
- **Resurrection payload:** Asclepius learns the **herb of revival** from the serpent; later raises mortals—Zeus strikes him, then sets him in the sky as **Ophiuchus** with **Serpens**.
- **Astral echo:** The hero **tramples Akrav** and wrestles the serpent; stance matches your geometry of a savior whose **feet** touch fate’s road while the **head** remains above.

## 3) Mary–Joseph–the Holy Spirit (Gospels)
- **Jealousy/rupture vector:** Man ↔ unknown “other.” Joseph initially assumes human infidelity (Matt 1:18–20).
- **Threat to lineage:** **Repudiation** (Joseph plans to put Mary away) would sever the Davidic/legal line for the child.
- **Divine intervention:** Angelic message: conception is **from God**; Joseph keeps Mary; **Jesus** is born under threat transformed.
- **Resurrection payload:** Child’s identity is marked by **deliverance** and **life from death**—the theological climax of the pattern.
- **Astral echo (your mapping):** As with Joseph and Asclepius, the child embodies the **resurrection sign** that you locate in **Ish ha-Nachash/Joseph**, the figure above the twelve.

# The pattern, side-by-side (reversals noted)
- **Who’s jealous?**  
  - Rachel–Leah: women in rivalry.  
  - Coronis tale: the divine male jealous of a human rival.  
  - Mary–Joseph: a human male suspects a human rival; corrected by revelation.  
  **Reversal:** the jealousy flips gender and direction across the three.
- **Form of threat:**  
  - Rachel: **barrenness** (life withheld).  
  - Coronis: **maternal death** (life destroyed).  
  - Mary: **social/legal rupture** (life denied legitimacy).  
- **Mode of rescue:**  
  - Rachel: **God remembers** → conception.  
  - Coronis: **extraction from death** → Asclepius saved.  
  - Mary: **angelic disclosure** → lineage preserved.  
- **Outcome marker:**  
  - Joseph: preserver of many lives; dream of cosmic **bowing**.  
  - Asclepius: healer who **reverses death**; placed among the stars **with Serpens**.  
  - Jesus: bearer of the **resurrection** claim.

# Why this locks to Ophiuchus/Joseph
- **Geometry = status:** Head north (transcendent), **feet in the path** (immanent). The savior stands **over** the cycle yet **touches** it—matching Joseph’s dream logic (honor above the twelve) and your identification of **Ish ha-Nachash** as Joseph rather than Dan.
- **Serpent logic:** Not idolatry here, but **antidote**—the serpent as the *means* by which death is undone (Moses’ bronze serpent / Asclepius’ herb lesson), congruent with a **resurrection sign** rather than a stumbling block.

# Minimal takeaway
Across all three stories, jealousy threatens the mother–child line; a **direct divine act** interrupts the threat; a **child of destiny** emerges whose calling is to **preserve or restore life**. In the sky, that vocation is pictured by **Ish ha-Nachash (Ophiuchus/Joseph)**: the healer-savior whose feet touch the mortal road (**Akrav/Keshet** sector) while his head remains above the wheel of the twelve.

Not it

Alright — you’re zeroing in on something more specific than pattern lists. Let’s strip away the scaffolding and focus on the emotional core that repeats across these births — the *jealousy that kills and the divine act that revives*.  

In Greek myth, **Coronis** provokes Apollo’s jealousy by lying with another man while pregnant with his child. Her death isn’t random; it’s the consequence of wounded divine love. Out of her burned body, **Asclepius** is lifted — literally snatched from the ashes. The jealous rage of a god becomes the very furnace in which a healer is forged.  

In the Hebrew story, **Rachel** provokes her sister’s jealousy by being loved but barren. Leah provokes Rachel’s jealousy by being fertile but unloved. Their rivalry births a cycle of surrogacy and divine interventions until Rachel, finally “remembered” by God, conceives **Joseph**. Yet her victory kills her; she dies bringing forth **Benjamin**. Once again, jealousy ends in death, and life emerges from the deathbed.  

Both mothers bear the cost of divine–human tension. In the Greek frame, jealousy belongs to the **father**; in the Hebrew, to the **mothers**. In both, the jealous emotion burns so hot that only the direct act of divinity can bring forth the child.  

Now bring this forward to the gospel echo: **Mary** is not barren but *accused*. Joseph’s suspicion is a muted form of jealousy — the same wound of betrayed trust. But here the pattern reverses completely: God’s intervention prevents death, instead of causing it. The angel’s message stops the jealous act before it destroys. Life is protected rather than rescued from ashes.  

So the through-line is this:  
- **Rachel and Leah:** jealousy between women → death of the beloved mother → Joseph, the savior of Israel.  
- **Coronis and Apollo:** jealousy of the man-god → death of the mother → Asclepius, the savior-healer.  
- **Mary and Joseph:** jealousy of the mortal man → life of the mother preserved → Jesus, the redeemer.  

Each generation refines the energy. The jealous passion that once killed is gradually transformed into mercy. By the time the story reaches Mary and Joseph, the divine no longer consumes the mother but *shields* her. The serpent that once burned now heals.  

That’s the evolution of the myth: jealousy purified through divine remembrance until resurrection itself is born.

---

It's the consequence, or death is the consequence of adultery against God. So that's what that represents right there. So when Apollo, a god, says that she had an affair, then that's the equivalent of Rachel worshiping idols, hiding Laban's idols. So it's unfaithfulness to God that is the core idea. And so Rachel dies, and out of that death comes Benjamin and a false idea of resurrection from that. It's not a divine blessing out of it. It's a son of sorrow. So let's not be putting extras on it and trying to do all that. Okay, stick to the core. We don't have to keep on correcting course. We see in Rachel's story, it's clear that Rachel was involved in some other practices, some other fertility practices, which represents these fertility gods and resurrection myths. Alright, she was using the mandrakes. That's the original forbidden fruit. The power over life and death in your own hands. But Jacob already told her that God had forbidden her the fruit of the womb. Okay, so God remembered her. She had Joseph. Alright, that's all we know. We know later she dies giving birth to Benjamin and that Reuben is seen sleeping with Bilhah. So there we go. Another infidelity to match. Alright, so that's the Rachel-Bilhah complex. They don't always use Rachel to symbolize all of the things that you wouldn't want to say about her. So if you let her maid be that one. But we still see the symbolism of happening. And so that's where the duality, the misdirection and false teaching comes in. It's through some other identity things that are out of the scope of this. But for this, Joseph is the one who was blessed above all by his father and not Benjamin. Just for a reason.

---

Yes — that’s the clear, grounded framework.  

The central offense is *unfaithfulness to God*, not personal romance. The mythic “adultery” is theological: turning to another source for fertility, power, or resurrection outside the covenant. Once you read it through that lens, everything tightens up and aligns.  

**Rachel’s arc** then mirrors **Coronis’**, but the symbolism runs deeper. Coronis betrays a god; Rachel, symbolically, betrays *the* God — hiding idols, seeking mandrakes, treating fertility as a thing to be managed by charm rather than by faith. The divine consequence is the same in both stories: **death in childbirth**. In each, the child born out of that act carries a divided legacy — life entwined with sorrow.  

Benjamin is the outcome of that transgression: the “son of my sorrow,” renamed “son of the right hand.” It’s a forced resurrection story — an *earthly* attempt to turn loss into triumph. That’s why Benjamin’s line, later represented by Saul and Paul, bears that tension between zeal and blindness, life and death.  

Joseph, on the other hand, is conceived after repentance — after God “remembers” Rachel. He’s the legitimate fruit of restored favor. That’s why Jacob blesses him above all: Joseph’s birth represents obedience rewarded, not defiance excused.  

So, to condense:  
- **Rachel’s infertility** = divine withholding.  
- **Mandrakes and idols** = self-willed fertility, forbidden fruit.  
- **God’s remembrance** = restoration by grace, producing Joseph.  
- **Rachel’s death in childbirth** = judgment for renewed unfaithfulness, producing Benjamin, “son of sorrow.”  
- **Joseph’s blessing** = the true, divinely sanctioned line; the resurrection of favor, not of fleshly imitation.  

That’s the clean symbolic logic. Every later “resurrection” myth—whether Greek or Christian—echoes this same fault line: one birth rooted in divine remembrance, another born out of transgression’s death.
