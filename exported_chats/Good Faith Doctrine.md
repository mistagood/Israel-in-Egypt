legal definition and context of good faith

---

In the realm of law, the term "good faith" carries significant weight, embodying the concept of honest intent to act without taking an unfair advantage over another party. This principle is pivotal across various legal contexts, ensuring that parties engage in sincere and transparent dealings.

In contractual agreements, good faith is essential. It signifies that all parties involved are expected to honor their commitments, engage in honest communication, and refrain from deceitful behavior. The expectation of good faith ensures that contracts are executed in a manner that respects the agreed terms, fostering trust and cooperation between parties.

In the legal arena, the breach of good faith can lead to serious consequences. For instance, in contract law, if a party is found to have acted in bad faith, it could result in the nullification of the contract or necessitate compensation for damages incurred by the affected party. Similarly, in employment law, good faith plays a crucial role, particularly in the context of employment contracts and dealings between employers and employees, emphasizing fairness and honesty in professional relationships.

The doctrine of good faith extends beyond contracts, influencing various legal disciplines such as property law, where it affects transactions and ownership rights, and in court proceedings, where it underpins the ethical standards expected of all participants.

Understanding and adhering to the principle of good faith is fundamental in the legal world, promoting integrity and fairness, and ensuring that justice is served in a manner that respects the rights and expectations of all involved.

how does it work in justice?

---

In the realm of justice, the concept of good faith is pivotal, serving as a cornerstone that upholds the integrity and fairness of legal proceedings and interactions within the justice system. Its application is multifaceted, influencing various aspects of law and ensuring that the principles of honesty and fairness permeate the justice system.

**Judicial Processes**: Judges, attorneys, and parties involved in legal cases are expected to operate in good faith, meaning they should act with honesty and without intent to deceive or defraud. This expectation ensures that the judicial process is conducted fairly, where evidence is presented transparently, and arguments are made with sincerity, without concealing facts or engaging in misleading conduct.

**Law Enforcement**: Good faith is crucial in law enforcement activities, where officers are expected to conduct their duties honestly and without bias. For example, when police obtain evidence or execute search warrants, they must do so believing that their actions are lawful and justified. If law enforcement acts in bad faith, such as conducting a search without a valid reason or fabricating evidence, it undermines the justice process and can lead to the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence or the dismissal of charges.

**Negotiations and Settlements**: In legal negotiations and settlement discussions, parties are expected to engage in good faith by being open and honest about their intentions and the facts of the case. This requirement helps facilitate fair and effective resolutions, preventing parties from manipulating or stalling the process for ulterior motives.

**Contractual and Fiduciary Relationships**: In contexts where parties have contractual or fiduciary relationships, good faith is essential to ensure that parties fulfill their obligations honestly and faithfully, respecting the trust placed in them. This includes business contracts, where parties must not undermine the agreement's purpose, and fiduciary duties, where individuals must act in the best interests of those they serve.

In summary, good faith in justice ensures that all participants in the legal system are committed to fairness, honesty, and integrity. It is a fundamental principle that supports the proper functioning of the justice system, promoting trust and confidence in legal processes and outcomes. Without good faith, the pursuit of justice would be marred by skepticism and the potential for unfair advantage, ultimately undermining the legal system's credibility and effectiveness.

explain grace period in the same legal context

---

In the legal context, a grace period refers to a set period allowed beyond a due date during which a particular obligation can be fulfilled without penalty or the forfeiture of a right. This concept is commonly applied in various legal and contractual scenarios, offering a buffer for parties to comply with their obligations without immediate repercussions for delays.

**Contracts and Agreements**: In contractual agreements, grace periods are often specified for payments or the fulfillment of other contractual obligations. For instance, if a payment is due on a certain date, the contract may allow a grace period of several days or weeks during which the payment can be made without incurring late fees or constituting a breach of the contract.

**Financial Obligations**: In the financial sector, lenders frequently provide grace periods for loan repayments. Should a borrower fail to make a payment by the due date, the grace period allows additional time to pay without facing penalties or the risk of default. Credit agreements, mortgages, and other financial instruments often include such provisions to accommodate slight delays in payment.

**Legal Notices and Filings**: Grace periods are also relevant in legal notices and filings. For example, if a legal document or response is required by a certain date, a grace period may allow additional time to complete this requirement without losing legal rights or facing adverse consequences.

**Insurance Policies**: In insurance, grace periods are crucial for maintaining coverage. If a premium is not paid by the due date, the insured may be granted a grace period during which the payment can be made, ensuring that the policy remains in effect and does not lapse.

**Intellectual Property**: In the realm of intellectual property, grace periods can apply to the renewal of patents or trademarks, allowing the holder additional time to renew without losing protection.

The grace period is a significant legal mechanism that recognizes the complexities and unforeseen circumstances in fulfilling obligations. It provides a safeguard that helps prevent unjust outcomes that could occur due to minor delays or oversights, ensuring that individuals and entities have a fair chance to maintain their rights and meet their responsibilities without immediate harsh penalties.

now what is severability

---

Severability is a legal concept and clause commonly found in contracts that ensures the overall contract remains enforceable even if one or more of its provisions are found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable. This principle is crucial for preserving the validity of the remaining portions of a contract, maintaining its effectiveness to the greatest extent possible despite the problematic sections.

**How Severability Works in Contracts**: A severability clause in a contract typically states that if any part of the contract is deemed void or unenforceable, that part can be removed or "severed" from the rest of the agreement, which will continue to be in full force and effect. This prevents the entire contract from being invalidated due to issues with a single provision.

**Legal Implications**: Without a severability clause, there's a risk that a single unenforceable term could render the entire contract void. This could lead to significant unfairness or unintended consequences, especially if the parties have already begun performing their obligations under the agreement. Severability helps mitigate this risk by preserving the enforceability of the contract's valid portions.

**Judicial Review**: When a court finds a part of a contract unenforceable, it will typically try to honor the parties' intentions as much as possible. If the contract includes a severability clause, the court will remove the problematic provision and enforce the remainder of the contract. However, if removing the provision would result in a significant change to the overall agreement or its core purposes, the court may determine that the entire contract is void.

**Scope and Limitations**: While severability clauses provide a mechanism for preserving contracts, they have limitations. For example, if the invalid provision is so central to the contract that its removal would fundamentally alter the agreement's nature, the entire contract might still be deemed unenforceable.

In summary, the concept of severability in legal contexts plays a pivotal role in ensuring that contracts and agreements remain effective and enforceable, even when certain sections are found to be problematic. It reflects a practical approach to contract enforcement, focusing on preserving the parties' intentions and the contract's integrity to the fullest extent possible.

how does knowledge of the content of a contract work as a defense to not performing. Is there a plausible deniability?

---

The knowledge of the content of a contract plays a critical role in contract enforcement and can significantly impact the defenses available to a party who is not performing their contractual obligations. Generally, when a party enters into a contract, they are presumed to have read, understood, and agreed to its terms. This presumption makes it challenging to claim ignorance of the contract's content as a defense. However, there are nuanced scenarios where the knowledge or understanding of a contract's terms can come into play.

1. **Mistake**: A party may claim that they were under a mistake regarding the terms or implications of the contract. There are two types of mistakes in contract law: mutual mistake (where both parties are mistaken about a crucial fact) and unilateral mistake (where only one party is mistaken). If a party can successfully prove a mutual mistake that goes to the essence of the contract, they might have a valid defense against performance. A unilateral mistake is generally not a defense unless it was induced by the other party's fraudulent misrepresentation.

2. **Misrepresentation and Fraud**: If a party was induced to enter into a contract based on a misrepresentation or fraud, they might argue that they were not aware of the contract's true nature. In such cases, the defrauded party can seek to void the contract or may have other remedies available.

3. **Duress and Undue Influence**: If a contract was signed under duress or undue influence, the affected party might claim that their understanding or consent was impaired, affecting their knowledge of the contract's content and their willingness to agree.

4. **Illiteracy or Incapacity**: If a party is illiterate, does not understand the language the contract is written in, or lacks the capacity to understand the contract (due to age, mental disability, etc.), they might argue that they were unaware of the contract's terms and therefore should not be held to them.

5. **Non-disclosure**: In certain contracts, especially those requiring utmost good faith (like insurance contracts), failure to disclose material facts can be a ground for voiding the contract. The non-breaching party may argue they were not aware of certain terms or implications due to the other party's failure to disclose.

In terms of "plausible deniability," this concept doesn't typically apply straightforwardly in contract law. Plausible deniability usually refers to the ability to deny knowledge of or responsibility for any damnable actions committed by others in an organizational hierarchy because of a lack of evidence that can confirm their participation. In contract law, however, parties are generally held to the standard of what a reasonable person in their position would have known or understood.

In essence, while ignorance of a contract's terms is not usually a valid defense, there are specific circumstances where the knowledge, understanding, or the manner in which agreement was reached can impact obligations and provide defenses against performance. However, these defenses must be substantiated with credible evidence to be considered valid in a court of law.

okay. Given these concepts of grace, good faith, severability, ignorance of one's contractual obligation, and plausible deniability, lets relate to Paul as a pharisaic lawyer arguing these points in context of the jewish law of Moses, which our law is based on. Specifically, will see whether in the final court of Judgement these arguments will be legal ddefenses for those who have followed Paulian or Christin doctrines which were based on Mosaic tenants which once abandoned create a violation. Lets look at the real Paulian (greco/roman) influences on our law to see how these actually create a deviant society

---

To explore this concept, let's delve into a hypothetical scenario where Paul, with his Pharisaic and legal background, argues points related to grace, good faith, severability, ignorance, and plausible deniability in the context of Jewish law, particularly the Mosaic Law. We will then extrapolate this to consider how such arguments might be viewed in a theological "final court of Judgment," particularly regarding adherence to Pauline or Christian doctrines that deviate from Mosaic tenets.

1. **Grace**: In Jewish law, the concept of grace can be seen in God's merciful and forgiving nature, as demonstrated through His covenants with Israel. Paul, in his letters, extends this concept to argue for grace through faith in Christ, suggesting a shift from adherence to the Law to a reliance on faith for salvation. In a final judgment context, Paul might argue that grace supersedes strict legal adherence, offering defense for those who embraced faith over legalistic observance.

2. **Good Faith**: In contractual terms, good faith aligns with sincerity and honesty in dealings. Paul could argue that Christian doctrines, rooted in love and faith, embody this principle, even if they diverge from Mosaic Law's specifics. The argument in the final judgment would be that the essence of one's relationship with God, grounded in good faith, is more critical than strict adherence to the Law's letter.

3. **Severability**: This legal principle might be likened to the idea that not all commandments in Mosaic Law hold equal weight in determining righteousness or moral standing. Paul's teachings often suggest that faith in Christ separates or 'severs' the need for adherence to every aspect of the Law for salvation. He might argue that belief in Christ maintains the contract's (covenant's) integrity even if some Mosaic laws are not followed to the letter.

4. **Ignorance**: Paul recognized that not all were aware of or understood Jewish Law, especially Gentiles. He preached that ignorance of the Law could be overcome through faith in Christ. In a divine judgment scenario, he might argue that ignorance of the Law is not a defense but that grace through faith offers a path to righteousness outside the Law's full knowledge or compliance.

5. **Plausible Deniability**: This concept is more challenging to apply in a theological context but could be interpreted as individuals denying responsibility for not following the Law because they were following what they believed to be a higher calling or understanding in Christ. Paul might argue that followers of his teachings are not culpable for abandoning Jewish Law if they did so out of a genuine belief in a new covenant through Christ.

When considering the "real Pauline (Greco-Roman) influences" on our law and whether they create a deviant society, it's crucial to differentiate between the theological and legalistic interpretations. Paul's influence on Western legal tradition is indirect, filtered through centuries of Christian thought that have shaped moral and ethical underpinnings of Western law. His teachings, emphasizing faith, grace, and moral principles over strict legal adherence, could be seen as fostering a society that values individual conscience and ethical behavior grounded in spiritual principles rather than merely legalistic compliance.

In the "final court of Judgment," the argument would pivot on whether adherence to faith and the principles taught by Paul reflects a true understanding and fulfillment of God's will, even if it means deviating from the original Mosaic Law. This theological debate hinges on interpretations of divine law, grace, and salvation, transcending the realm of human legal systems but deeply influencing them through the moral and ethical values they instill.

indeed. Religion and law were one for Paul so we can safely assume the analogies of courts and judgement are appropriate here. Now Israel was under a covenant with God and a law that governed the covenant. Paul was accused of being a lawbreaker and in fact the man of lawlessness who leads the world against the teachings of God given to Moses (Acts 21). 
lets play it out if one showed to heaven and found Christ says "I never knew you" even though they were following christian teachings. How? 
1. grace is a temporary period but does not stop the debt. If the debt were paid grace is not necessary.
2. Paul does not act in good faith as a leader. He lies, cheats, and admits to saying anything to get a convert. It would be unwise to believe him.
3. Biblically speaking If you break one law you are a law breaker and guilty of the whole law. Moses also said to keep the whole law. Not one jot will pass away from the law. 
4. Jesus sent disciples to preach to all the earth, every corner. Every eye will witness. Anyone who knows Christ, has the opportunity to then know the father. The son does nothing without the father, therefore why haven't you inquired of the father as well (Mosaic Law).
5. Plausible deniability: Many will think that 'being a christian was good enough, and if they sinned, it was the leaders that led them astray. After all, how many speak hebrew? 'This will be no excuse as Jesus says "depart from me you evildoer, I never knew you!"

Ironically, all these clauses and ideas actually privilege the powerful. most often grace periods affect poor people with bad loans or high rent. Officials in court are assumed to act in good faith but citizens are often presumed guilty by those same hypocritical officials in court. predatory lending contracts born in greed are simply revised to seem legal or fair, like slavery and the constitution which allowed it, then amended it to legal servitude. ignorance of the law through neglect has led to captivity by the enforcers of the law.

Your scenario paints a vivid picture of the complexities and potential contradictions between Pauline theology and Mosaic Law, especially when viewed through the lens of final judgment. Let's dissect the points you've raised in this theological court setting:

1. **Grace and Debt**: In this context, grace is viewed as a period of reprieve, not an erasure of the debt of sin. If one follows this line of reasoning, then even under grace, the underlying obligation to adhere to God's laws remains. The argument would be that reliance solely on grace, without a corresponding commitment to law and righteousness, falls short in the final judgment.

2. **Paul's Good Faith**: If Paul is perceived as having ulterior motives or employing deceitful methods, then his leadership and teachings might be questioned. Followers might find themselves in a precarious position if they've based their faith solely on his interpretation of the gospel, especially if it's deemed to have strayed from the truth of Mosaic Law.

3. **Lawbreaking**: The biblical assertion that breaking one law is akin to breaking the entire law underscores the seriousness of deviating from God's commandments. If one accepts this premise, then any teaching suggesting that certain aspects of the law can be disregarded could lead followers to a false sense of security and, ultimately, to being deemed lawbreakers themselves.

4. **Knowledge and Inquiry**: The expectation that followers of Christ should also engage with the Father and His laws highlights a potential shortfall in a solely Christ-centered faith that neglects the broader context of God's teachings. This point suggests that a comprehensive understanding and observance of God's will, as outlined in Mosaic Law, are essential for true discipleship.

5. **Plausible Deniability**: The idea that followers could claim ignorance or shift blame to leadership for their spiritual misdirection is challenged by the expectation of personal responsibility in seeking and adhering to truth. This suggests that each individual is accountable for their spiritual journey and cannot simply rely on the teachings of others, particularly if those teachings are flawed.

Your broader reflection on how these spiritual concepts mirror societal and legal issues is poignant. It underscores the notion that interpretations of divine laws can reflect and reinforce societal inequities, with the powerful often benefiting from structures that ostensibly offer grace, good faith, and leniency. This parallel between spiritual and worldly justice highlights the importance of scrutinizing both religious teachings and legal structures to ensure they truly promote fairness, accountability, and righteousness.

In the grand theological narrative, the tension between Pauline doctrine and Mosaic Law raises profound questions about the nature of faith, salvation, and accountability, urging believers to critically assess their spiritual foundations and the teachings they follow.

excellent. except that I'm not sure if you caught the nuance of paul's teaching Faith as a primary means, while acting in less than good faith. Also good faith payments are ironically required from individuals to make a property offer for purchase. 

---

You're right to highlight the nuanced interplay between Paul's emphasis on faith as the cornerstone of salvation and the implications of his own conduct and teachings, which some may view as not always aligning with the principle of good faith.

1. **Faith Versus Good Faith**: Paul advocates for faith in Christ as the primary means of justification and salvation, often emphasizing this over strict adherence to the law. However, if his actions or teachings are perceived as manipulative or deceitful, it introduces a tension between the content of his message and the manner of its delivery. This raises questions about the integrity and reliability of his teachings, especially if followers are expected to act in good faith while the apostle himself is seen as not doing so.

2. **Good Faith Payments**: The concept of good faith payments in secular transactions, like property purchases, serves as an interesting parallel. Just as a good faith payment demonstrates the buyer's sincere intention to complete a transaction, a spiritual "good faith payment" could be seen as an individual's sincere effort to live according to God's laws and teachings. In Paul's context, if he preaches faith as the currency of salvation, yet his actions suggest a lack of sincerity or integrity, it could be seen as him not making a "good faith payment" in his spiritual transaction with followers and, ultimately, with God.

This juxtaposition underscores a critical aspect of religious faith: it's not just about professing belief but also about embodying the principles one advocates. If Paul's teachings are interpreted as prioritizing belief to the exclusion of ethical conduct or sincerity, it could suggest a form of spiritual hypocrisy, where the external profession of faith is not matched by an internal commitment to live out that faith in a manner consistent with the teachings of Jesus and the broader biblical narrative.

---

i think you got it backwards. The act of faith according to paul, is counterintuitive to needing proof of a payment. Then there is no faith that they are acting in good faith! See it priveledges the seller who may even keep the money if something goes wrong. Benefiting from not selling the property, which they may still be enriched from as well. 

---

You've pointed out a critical nuance in the comparison between the act of faith in Paul's teachings and the concept of a good faith payment in secular transactions. In Pauline theology, faith is indeed about trust without the need for tangible proof or assurance. It's a commitment to believe and follow even without a visible guarantee or "payment." This is fundamentally different from a good faith payment in a transaction, where the payment itself serves as a tangible proof of intent to engage in a contract or agreement.

When applying this to spiritual matters, if one acts on faith according to Paul's teachings, they do so without requiring proof of God's promise in the immediate, tangible sense. This faith is supposed to be its own form of assurance, contrasting with a good faith payment where the assurance comes from the physical act of making a payment.

However, when this concept is exploited, particularly by those in positions of religious authority, it can indeed privilege the "seller" (in this case, potentially a religious leader or institution) at the expense of the "buyer" (the believer or follower). If the believer's faith is manipulated or taken advantage of, the leader may benefit (through authority, offerings, etc.) without necessarily upholding their end of the spiritual "contract." The believer acts in faith without seeing tangible proof, while the leader may not be held accountable for delivering on the spiritual promises or teachings they espouse.

This dynamic can create a situation where the believer is left vulnerable, acting on faith without the safeguards that a tangible good faith payment might provide in a secular transaction. It highlights the importance of integrity and accountability in religious leadership, ensuring that the trust placed by followers in their leaders and in their understanding of spiritual teachings is not misplaced or exploited.

---

this shows the impracticality of what paul is teaching. In life men have found that harmony occurs when they act on faith (works with faith). Thus a good faith payment gets follow-thru on both ends. This is the equivalent of circumcision.  a show/action of faith. 

---

Your observation draws an interesting parallel between the concept of a good faith payment in secular transactions and the religious practice of circumcision as an act demonstrating faith, specifically within the context of Paul's teachings.

In the Jewish tradition, circumcision is more than just a physical act; it's a covenantal sign, a tangible demonstration of faith and commitment to God's commandments. It represents an action that accompanies and signifies faith, aligning with the idea that faith should be accompanied by corresponding actions, or works, to be complete or authentic.

Paul's teachings, particularly in his letters to the early Christian communities, often emphasize faith in Christ as the primary means of salvation, sometimes appearing to downplay the necessity of works or tangible signs like circumcision (Galatians 5:6). He argues that faith alone is sufficient for justification, a point that contrasts with the idea that faith must be manifested through specific actions or observances to be genuine or effective.

Your point suggests that, in practical terms, faith and actions (like a good faith payment ensuring mutual follow-through in a transaction) should go hand in hand to maintain harmony and trust. This could be seen as analogous to the role of circumcision in Jewish law—an outward, tangible sign of an inward faith and commitment. In this light, Paul's teaching might be viewed as challenging because it suggests a departure from the traditional understanding that faith is inherently linked to and demonstrated by specific actions or observances.

This brings up a fundamental debate in religious and philosophical circles about the nature of faith and works—whether faith alone is sufficient for spiritual fulfillment and salvation, or whether it must be accompanied by demonstrable actions to be valid or complete. Your analogy underscores the importance of this debate, suggesting that just as in contractual agreements, where good faith payments ensure commitment and follow-through, in spiritual matters, tangible expressions of faith (like circumcision) serve to solidify and demonstrate one's commitment to their beliefs and covenant with God.

again, we must realize that this is a matter of a contract, a covenantal law dispute about inheriting the kingdom

---

Indeed, when we frame the discussion within the context of a covenantal law dispute regarding the inheritance of the kingdom, the parallels between legal contracts and biblical covenants become even more pronounced. The concept of a covenant in the Bible, particularly in the context of the relationship between God and His people, is akin to a contract in legal terms—it's an agreement that comes with specific stipulations, promises, and expectations for both parties involved.

In the biblical narrative, the covenant God made with Israel, as detailed in the Mosaic Law, is a form of divine contract. It stipulates the conditions under which Israel would be God's chosen people and inherit His blessings, including the land and the kingdom. The Law, including its rituals, commandments, and ordinances, serves as the terms of this covenant, detailing what the Israelites must do to uphold their end of the agreement.

Paul's teachings, particularly his emphasis on faith in Christ as the basis for justification and inheritance of the kingdom, introduce a new dimension to this contractual relationship. He argues that the covenant is fulfilled and transformed in Christ, meaning that adherence to the Mosaic Law is no longer the sole or primary means of maintaining the covenant. Instead, faith in Christ—a belief and trust in his death and resurrection as the means of salvation—becomes the new "contractual" term for entering into and maintaining this covenantal relationship with God.

This shift introduces a significant legal and theological debate: if the original covenant was based on adherence to the Law, can it be legitimately modified or fulfilled in a way that changes the terms (from works to faith)? And what does this mean for the "inheritance" of the kingdom? Is it based on the original covenantal terms (the Law), or is it based on the new terms established through faith in Christ?

In this context, the discussions around good faith, grace periods, and the knowledge and fulfillment of contractual obligations become even more pertinent. Just as in legal contracts, where the understanding and adherence to the terms determine the fulfillment and outcomes of the agreement, in the biblical covenant, how one understands and adheres to the stipulated terms (whether viewed through the lens of Mosaic Law or faith in Christ) determines their standing and inheritance within the kingdom of God.

So, in the "final court of judgment," the debate might center on whether the "contract" of the covenant has been fulfilled according to its original terms (the Law) or whether its terms have been legitimately altered or fulfilled in a new way through Christ (faith). This brings to the forefront questions about the nature of the covenant, the requirements for being part of God's kingdom, and how God's justice and mercy are reconciled in the judgment process.

okay lets think about it. Paul introduces a severability clause. Which makes sense if there's no more temple in the coming times after christ. but the promise is in affect. So there has been a good faith payment and now a 3 day grace period. The 3 days being the millenia since christ. this being the 3rd, its time for the sacrificial offering that moses spoke of in the atonement with azazael. the wilderness is today and america. either way, the final payment is due. The covenant was to be holy and set apart to God. The fire or melting pot of afliction is where we are and we must purge the teachings of the man of lawlessness. This is the symbolic cutting off the head of the rebellious benjamites in the bible (those who divide Israel- Saul, Sheba, even the rebellious benjamites at Rimmon were cut off from among Israel). Paul is the last link, The Benjamite of Benjamites

---

The analogy you've drawn here, interpreting the events and timelines of Christian eschatology through the lens of contractual obligations and legal frameworks, is quite intriguing. In this interpretation, Paul's teachings are seen as introducing a "severability clause" into the Mosaic covenant. This notion suggests that even if one part of the covenant (the temple worship, for instance) becomes impracticable or obsolete, the overall covenant remains in effect. This aligns with the idea that the core promise of the covenant, the spiritual and salvific aspects, persists beyond the physical and ceremonial components of the Mosaic Law.

Your analogy extends to the concept of a "good faith payment," represented by the death and resurrection of Christ, followed by a "grace period" of three millennia, symbolizing the time from Christ's resurrection to a future culmination of events. This interpretation aligns with certain Christian eschatological views that see history unfolding in a divinely orchestrated timeline, where the "third day" or "third millennium" holds significant transformative potential, possibly a time of final reckoning or fulfillment of God's promises.

The reference to the atonement with Azazel, the wilderness, and America as the modern context for these events brings in a unique perspective, intertwining biblical prophecies with contemporary settings and interpretations. The call to purge the teachings of the "man of lawlessness" can be seen as a metaphorical challenge to reject teachings and practices that are viewed as contrary to the original intent and purity of the divine covenant.

In this framework, Paul's identity as a Benjaminite becomes symbolically significant, echoing the biblical narratives where Benjamites play pivotal roles in the unity and division of Israel. This interpretation casts Paul's teachings in a critical light, suggesting that they represent a final test or challenge to the covenant community, a test that must be navigated to return to the covenant's original terms and conditions.

This narrative weaves together legal concepts, biblical prophecy, and historical events to create a compelling theological and eschatological scenario. It challenges believers to discern and adhere to the true essence of their covenant with God, as understood through this particular interpretative lens.

Its bigger. Paul's perspective impacted the world being picked up by Rome and entering the new world through slavery and economic laws. These very benjamite principals govern our contracts and even our idea of justice. Jesus said unless your righteousness exceeds that of the LAWYERS, you will in no way make it. The idea that Jesus was crucified and resurrected departs from Mosaic salvation. there was an atonement ritual, but Judas was the sin offering and Jesus the scapegoat was not harmed but released by pilate In secret as barabbas (son of the father). The ones who accept this form of salvation are guilty of uncircumsized hearts so they are the uncircumcised. An unclean person refuses to repent  and stop their own sins but accepts an innocent mans death as payment for their own debt. This is a thief and as such a lawbreaker. His heart is unclean because he would not do unto his brother as himself. Christ said love is to lay down your life for your friends, not let your friends die for you. Thus if love according to even paul is the greatest commandment then they violate this by accepting an innocent man's death as payment for their own debt.  Is this not the simple yet elegant truth of the ultimate test? By the third day (of grace) one is expected to have made good use of the time- to increase the 'talents' the master has bestowed and be deemed a good servant (study to show thyself approved).  Reiterate this this legal theory Ive come upp with with all this in mind. Lets write it in a bulleted format

---

Your interpretation presents a complex and thought-provoking perspective, intertwining theological, legal, and moral elements to critique the traditional Christian understanding of atonement and salvation. Here's a bulleted summary of your legal theory, considering all the elements you've discussed:

- **Paul's Influence on Legal and Theological Concepts**: 
  - Paul's teachings, adopted by Rome and integrated into Western legal and religious frameworks, have profoundly influenced concepts of justice, contract, and covenant.
  - These "Benjamite principles" in Paul's writings have shaped how contracts are viewed and enforced, emphasizing faith and belief over actions and adherence to law.

- **Jesus's Righteousness and Legal Professionals**:
  - Jesus emphasized that righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees and lawyers, challenging adherents to exceed mere legalistic adherence and embrace a deeper, more genuine form of righteousness.

- **Departure from Mosaic Salvation**:
  - The traditional Christian narrative of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection is seen as a departure from the Mosaic atonement ritual.
  - In this interpretation, Judas represents the sin offering, while Jesus, likened to the scapegoat, is released (symbolized by Barabbas's release), challenging conventional views of atonement.

- **Critique of Atonement Through Jesus's Death**:
  - Accepting Jesus's death as payment for one's sins is portrayed as having an uncircumcised heart—a refusal to repent and cease personal sin, relying instead on the sacrifice of an innocent.
  - This perspective suggests a moral and spiritual failing, equating the acceptance of vicarious atonement with theft or lawbreaking.

- **Love as the Fulfillment of the Law**:
  - True love, according to Jesus (and even Paul), is laying down one's life for others, not allowing others to die in one's stead.
  - Accepting Jesus's death as atonement violates the principle of love, which is seen as the greatest commandment, thus failing the test of genuine righteousness.

- **The Third Day (Millennium) of Grace**:
  - The "third day" or millennium is viewed as a grace period for humanity to realign with God's original covenant, emphasizing repentance, personal transformation, and adherence to divine commandments.
  - This period is a test, an opportunity to "increase the talents" given by God, demonstrating faith through righteous actions and not merely through belief in atonement.

- **The Ultimate Test of Faith and Righteousness**:
  - The final evaluation in the "court" of divine judgment will assess whether individuals have used the grace period to cultivate true righteousness, surpassing legalistic adherence and embracing genuine, sacrificial love.
  - This test challenges believers to reflect on the nature of atonement, salvation, and righteousness, moving beyond Pauline doctrine to a more profound understanding and practice of faith.

This theory offers a critical reexamination of Christian atonement theology, advocating for a return to a covenantal relationship with God that prioritizes personal righteousness, repentance, and love, fulfilling the deeper essence of the Law.

what the hell are you talking about? where is the severability, grace and faith?

---

Let's directly align your theory with the legal concepts of severability, grace, and faith in a structured format:

- **Severability in Paul's Teachings**:
  - Paul introduces a form of severability to the Mosaic covenant, suggesting that faith in Christ can sever the need for traditional adherence to the Law while maintaining the covenant with God.
  - This implies that even if certain aspects of the Law are no longer practicable (e.g., temple worship), the covenant's core promise remains intact through faith in Christ.

- **Grace Period**: 
  - The concept of a grace period is paralleled with the "three days" or "three millennia" since Christ, interpreted as a time given to humanity to understand and align with the true essence of God's covenant.
  - This period is a time for reflection and repentance, allowing individuals to rectify their understanding and practice of faith before the "final payment" or judgment.

- **Faith and Actions**:
  - While Paul emphasizes faith as the means to salvation, your theory critiques this by suggesting that true faith must be accompanied by actions (akin to a good faith payment) that demonstrate genuine commitment to God's laws and principles.
  - This challenges the notion that belief alone suffices, advocating for a faith that is active and manifested through righteous living, akin to the "talents" being productively used during the grace period.

- **Legal Theory Summary**:
  - Your legal theory suggests that Paul's doctrine, by focusing on faith alone, may inadvertently sever essential aspects of the covenant that require active adherence and righteousness.
  - The grace period since Christ is seen as a time allocated for humanity to realign with God's intentions, where faith must be demonstrated through concrete, righteous actions, not merely belief.
  - The ultimate test, then, is whether individuals have utilized this grace period to cultivate a faith that is both believing and active, fulfilling the covenant's requirements in a manner that exceeds mere legalistic adherence or passive faith.

This interpretation advocates for a holistic view of the covenant, where faith, actions, and adherence to God's commands are inseparably intertwined, ensuring that the covenant's fulfillment is not solely reliant on belief but is demonstrated through a life of righteousness and love.

you missed my views that show paul's argument as violating the covenant. all three.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's reframe the points to highlight how Paul's teachings, according to your perspective, could be seen as violating the covenant through the lenses of severability, grace, and faith:

- **Severability and the Covenant Violation**:
  - While Paul introduces a form of severability that suggests faith in Christ alone is sufficient, this approach could be seen as violating the original covenant, which required adherence to the Law. By severing the need to follow the Law based on faith in Christ, Paul's teachings might be viewed as breaking the comprehensive terms of the covenant established through Moses.

- **Grace Period as a Covenant Violation**:
  - The concept of a grace period, represented by the time since Christ's resurrection, is interpreted in Pauline theology as a time when adherence to the Law is no longer necessary due to the grace offered through Christ. This interpretation could be seen as a violation of the covenant because it suggests that the covenant's requirements can be set aside or ignored during this period, undermining the continuous obligation to live according to God's laws.

- **Faith Without Works as a Covenant Violation**:
  - Paul's emphasis on justification through faith alone, without the need for works (or adherence to the Law), directly contrasts with the covenantal requirement that faith be demonstrated through obedience and righteous actions. This aspect of Paul's teaching could be viewed as violating the covenant by suggesting that the physical manifestations of faith through adherence to the Law are unnecessary, thereby undermining the covenant's call for a holistic expression of faith that includes both belief and action.

In summary, from your perspective, Paul's arguments regarding severability, grace, and faith could be seen as undermining the original terms of the covenant with God. This perspective holds that Paul's teachings diverge from the covenant's requirements, which call for ongoing obedience to the Law, demonstrated through both faith and actions, to maintain the covenantal relationship with God.

stop the "might" this is my argument. make it strong.

Understood. Here's your argument presented assertively, emphasizing how Paul's teachings are seen as violating the covenant through the concepts of severability, grace, and faith:

- **Severability and Covenant Violation**:
  - Paul's teachings introduce a severability clause that directly violates the covenant by suggesting that faith in Christ alone suffices, negating the need for adherence to the Mosaic Law. This contradicts the covenant's comprehensive nature, which demands observance of the Law in its entirety. By advocating that parts of the Law can be severed due to faith in Christ, Paul undermines the covenant's integrity and the continual obligation to live by its statutes.

- **Grace Period as a Covenant Violation**:
  - The notion of a grace period since Christ's resurrection, as interpreted through Pauline theology, is a clear breach of the covenant. It implies that the covenant's stipulations can be disregarded during this era because of the grace afforded through Christ. This interpretation is a violation because it dismisses the enduring nature of the covenant's requirements, suggesting that temporal grace absolves the need for ongoing compliance with God's laws.

- **Faith Without Works as a Covenant Violation**:
  - Paul's emphasis on justification through faith alone, excluding the necessity for works or adherence to the Law, is a blatant violation of the covenant. The covenant explicitly requires that faith be manifested through obedience and righteous deeds. By declaring that faith alone is sufficient for justification and covenantal fulfillment, Paul's teachings reject the covenantal mandate for a comprehensive expression of faith that encompasses both belief and action, thereby contravening the covenant's foundational principles.

Your argument asserts that Paul's teachings on severability, grace, and faith fundamentally breach the terms of the divine covenant, challenging the necessity for continual obedience to the Law and the holistic expression of faith through both belief and action.

I compared these to modern contract law and showed how they were unfair and how modern law is based on Paul's violating 3 doctines wich have seeped into our law 

---

Your argument compellingly draws parallels between Paul's theological doctrines and their influence on modern contract law, asserting that the perceived violations of covenant principles in Paul's teachings have permeated legal practices, resulting in unfairness within the legal system. Here's a structured outline of your argument, emphasizing the direct impact of Pauline doctrines on contemporary contract law:

- **Severability and Modern Contract Law**:
  - Paul's introduction of a severability concept in theological terms suggests that parts of a covenant can be disregarded while maintaining the covenant's validity. This has influenced modern contract law, where severability allows a contract to remain enforceable even if some clauses are invalidated. However, applying this to a sacred covenant undermines the holistic adherence required by the Mosaic Law, reflecting in legal practices where the spirit of an agreement can be compromised by the letter of the law.

- **Grace Period in Legal Contexts**:
  - The Pauline concept of a grace period, where adherence to the Law is deemed unnecessary due to divine grace, parallels legal grace periods that delay the enforcement of obligations. While beneficial in temporal matters, applying such a concept to a divine covenant dilutes the continuous nature of the covenantal obligations. In law, this can lead to practices where parties may delay fulfilling their duties, banking on leniencies that could undermine the contract's intent.

- **Faith Without Works: Legal Implications**:
  - Paul's doctrine that faith alone is sufficient for justification, independent of deeds, mirrors legal scenarios where intent or agreement alone is considered sufficient without the necessary follow-through. In legal terms, this could foster a culture where the actual performance under a contract is undervalued compared to the mere agreement or intent, leading to unfair outcomes where responsibilities can be evaded.

Your argument posits that these Pauline doctrines have translated into legal principles that can sometimes result in unjust outcomes, reflecting a deviation from the comprehensive and action-oriented nature of the original covenantal expectations. This analysis suggests a critical reevaluation of how these theological concepts, when embedded in legal frameworks, might compromise the balance between justice, intent, and action in modern law.
