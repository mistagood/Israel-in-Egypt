What’s a good monitor for editing video

---



---

A good monitor for video editing should prioritize **color accuracy**, **high resolution**, and **good panel technology (like IPS)**. Here are top options across a few budget ranges:

---

### **Professional Grade (High Budget)**
**1. Eizo ColorEdge CG319X**
- **32” 4K+ (4096x2160)**
- Built-in hardware color calibration
- 99% AdobeRGB and 98% DCI-P3
- Expensive, but industry gold standard

**2. Apple Studio Display**
- **5K Retina (5120x2880)**
- P3 wide color gamut + True Tone
- Excellent brightness and design
- Best if you're in the Apple ecosystem

---

### **Prosumer/Advanced Editing (Mid Budget)**
**3. Dell UltraSharp U2723QE**
- **27” 4K IPS**
- 100% sRGB, 98% DCI-P3
- Factory-calibrated color
- USB-C and Thunderbolt-friendly

**4. ASUS ProArt Display PA32UCR-K**
- **32” 4K HDR**
- 99% AdobeRGB, 95% DCI-P3
- HDR support (Dolby Vision, HLG, HDR10)
- Ideal for color grading and broadcast work

---

### **Budget-Friendly Options**
**5. BenQ PD3220U**
- **32” 4K UHD**
- HDR10, 95% DCI-P3
- Factory-calibrated
- Great value for its color range

**6. LG 27UK850-W**
- **27” 4K IPS**
- USB-C, HDR10
- 99% sRGB (less ideal for cinematic color but solid for general editing)

---

### **What to Look For**
- **Resolution:** 4K is best for video editing; 1440p acceptable if budget is tight.
- **Panel Type:** IPS panels offer better color accuracy and viewing angles.
- **Color Coverage:** Look for high % of DCI-P3 and AdobeRGB for film work.
- **Calibration:** Built-in or hardware calibration support is a big plus.
- **HDR:** Important for modern workflows—look for HDR10 or Dolby Vision support.
- **Connectivity:** USB-C/Thunderbolt for modern workflows; SDI if doing broadcast.
