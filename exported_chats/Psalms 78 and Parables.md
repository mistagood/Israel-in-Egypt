### 🔹 **Quoted in Matthew 13:35 (KJV)**
> **"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."**

Here, Jesus' use of parables is shown to fulfill Psalm 78:2 — though Matthew slightly expands and interprets it, emphasizing the **secrecy and foundational mysteries** being revealed.

### ✨ Summary:
The verse is about **revealing hidden knowledge** — not newly invented doctrine, but **ancient truths** that were misunderstood or concealed. The Hebrew words point to **parables (māšāl)** and **riddles (ḥidōṯ)**, indicating a **prophetic, coded message** rooted in the past. When Jesus speaks in parables, he is tapping into this tradition — opening his mouth not to obscure, but to **reveal** deep truths to those with ears to hear.

Let me know if you want to trace how "dark sayings" or "ḥidōṯ" are used elsewhere (like Proverbs or Numbers).
