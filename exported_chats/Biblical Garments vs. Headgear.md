# Biblical Garments vs. Headgear



---



---

Explore the difference between Moses' teachings about specific garments that the priests or the people should wear and headgear that they should wear versus Paul's teachings about what men should wear on their head or not. I was confronted by an individual who said I'm supposed to take off my headgear when the Bible comes out period. I don't think this is biblical but I do think it comes from Paul's teachings and I think this conflicts with what Moses taught about being holy and wearing garments.

The issue of head coverings and specific garments in the Bible reveals a significant contrast between the teachings of Moses in the Torah and the teachings attributed to Paul in the New Testament. The two present different approaches to sacred dress and the act of covering or uncovering one's head, reflecting deeper theological and cultural shifts within the early Israelite and later Christian communities.

Moses’ teachings in the Torah, particularly in the books of Exodus and Leviticus, emphasize the importance of specific garments for priests and the people of Israel when approaching holy service or encountering the divine presence. The focus is on being set apart—holy—and demonstrating this through the clothing and accessories worn during worship or when performing sacred duties. For instance:

1. **Priestly Garments in the Torah**: In Exodus 28 and 39, Moses provides detailed instructions for the garments that the priests, particularly the High Priest, should wear. These garments include the ephod, breastplate, robe, tunic, sash, and headgear (a turban or mitre), which were all designed to be beautiful and reflective of God’s glory. The headgear, specifically the "mitre" for the High Priest, had a gold plate inscribed with "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" (Exodus 28:36-39). These garments were intended to set the priests apart, showing their sanctity and dedication to God's service.

2. **Headgear and Holiness**: The wearing of specific headgear (the mitre or turban) was part of the ritual purity and sanctification process. The head coverings were not just cultural but were commanded by God as part of the priestly duties. This headgear symbolized the bearing of the iniquity of the holy things and represented a continuous mark of being set apart for God's service. This concept emphasizes holiness, honor, and the recognition of divine authority.

3. **Garments for the People**: The wider community also had instructions regarding dress and behavior, particularly in how they approached God during worship or communal gathering. Moses' teachings suggest that appropriate garments and coverings are part of honoring God and maintaining the community's purity and distinction.

In contrast, Paul's teachings in the New Testament, specifically in his letters to the early Christian churches, present a different perspective:

1. **Paul on Head Coverings**: In 1 Corinthians 11:4-7, Paul states, "Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved." Paul further adds that men should not cover their heads because they are "the image and glory of God," while women are the "glory of man." This teaching reflects a different theological view that emphasizes the distinctions between men and women in worship, symbolized by head coverings or the lack thereof.

2. **The Conflict with Mosaic Law**: Paul's approach appears to be more influenced by Greco-Roman customs and societal norms of the time rather than the detailed commandments laid out by Moses for Israel. The Mosaic Law does not prohibit men from wearing head coverings, and in fact, mandates it for the priests. Thus, Paul's insistence on men uncovering their heads stands in stark contrast to the earlier traditions and practices of Israel under Mosaic Law. This creates a potential conflict for those who see themselves adhering to the Mosaic covenant.

3. **The Broader Theological Implications**: Paul's reinterpretation might be viewed as an attempt to create a distinct Christian identity separate from Jewish customs. However, this move has implications for understanding holiness and community practices. Where Moses emphasized holiness through prescribed garments as a sign of dedication to God, Paul seems to emphasize different cultural symbols that align more with the socio-political realities of the early Christian communities in a predominantly Greco-Roman world.

In summary, Moses’ teachings on garments, including headgear, are deeply rooted in the concept of holiness and being set apart for divine service. The wearing of specific garments and head coverings is commanded as a sign of sanctification and commitment to God. On the other hand, Paul's teachings in the New Testament shift the focus, presenting a different interpretation that reflects the socio-cultural norms of his day and may diverge from the original intent of Mosaic Law. 

The argument that men must remove headgear when the Bible is present or during worship seems to come more from Paul's influence than from Mosaic instruction. If one is adhering to Moses’ teachings about garments and head coverings as a sign of holiness and dedication, there would be no biblical mandate to remove head coverings. Instead, Paul's interpretation could be seen as contextual and culturally specific, rather than universally binding.

Please explain the customs of the time that would’ve been forged Paul and the head coverings. I need to know these for when I explain this to the brothers.

To understand Paul's teachings on head coverings, particularly in 1 Corinthians 11:4-7, it's essential to consider the cultural and social context of the Greco-Roman world in which Paul was writing. During this period, customs surrounding head coverings for men and women were deeply intertwined with social, religious, and cultural norms. These customs influenced Paul's instructions to the early Christian communities, which were often situated in diverse, multi-cultural urban centers like Corinth.

### 1. **Greco-Roman Cultural Norms and Gender Distinctions**

In the Greco-Roman society of Paul's time, head coverings held significant symbolic meaning, particularly regarding gender roles, social status, and propriety. Here are some key aspects of the customs:

- **Men's Head Coverings**: In Roman culture, it was typical for men to uncover their heads during religious rituals to show reverence to the gods. Covering the head could be seen as dishonorable or effeminate. The act of a man covering his head might also suggest mourning or a status of humility, which could be contextually inappropriate in public worship settings where honor and status were important. 

- **Women's Head Coverings**: Conversely, women were generally expected to cover their heads in public, especially in worship settings or when engaged in public speaking or prophecy. A woman's head covering symbolized modesty, respectability, and submission, not just to the gods, but also to her husband and the social order. In Roman and Greek cultures, a woman appearing in public without a head covering could be seen as dishonoring her husband and herself, or even as signaling promiscuity or a lack of moral integrity.

- **Social Status and Distinction**: Head coverings also distinguished social status and class. A freedwoman or matron would wear a head covering as a sign of her dignity and status, while slaves and prostitutes were often not permitted to wear them. Thus, wearing a head covering could also signify one's social position and respectability within the community.

### 2. **Religious Practices and Syncretism in Corinth**

Corinth, where Paul addressed the issue of head coverings, was a cosmopolitan city with a mix of various religions, cultures, and social practices. This melting pot context likely contributed to diverse interpretations and practices within the early Christian community. The following points shed light on the religious customs of the time:

- **Temple Practices**: Corinth was known for its many temples and cults, such as the Temple of Aphrodite. In some Greco-Roman religious practices, both men and women might have different dress codes and head coverings to differentiate their roles and statuses during rituals. For instance, in some cultic rituals, women with uncovered heads might be seen as playing particular roles related to fertility, prophecy, or even mourning.

- **Jewish Influence**: The early Christian community in Corinth would also have included Jewish believers who came from traditions where head coverings had different meanings. In Jewish customs, particularly during worship in the synagogue or temple, men often wore head coverings (such as the tallit or prayer shawl) as a sign of reverence and piety. This tradition would contrast sharply with the Greco-Roman customs, creating potential tensions within the early Christian congregations.

### 3. **Paul's Adaptation to Local Customs and Maintaining Order**

Understanding Paul's directive about head coverings requires recognizing his concern for maintaining order and avoiding scandal or misunderstanding in the early Christian communities:

- **Avoiding Offense and Cultural Scandal**: Paul’s directive that men should not cover their heads while praying or prophesying and that women should cover their heads can be seen as an attempt to align the Christian worship practices with the prevailing cultural norms to avoid scandal and offense. For men, keeping their heads uncovered would avoid any association with effeminacy or mourning, aligning with the cultural expectations of dignity and masculinity. For women, covering their heads would align with expectations of modesty, respect, and submission to their husbands, reflecting the social hierarchies of the time.

- **Promoting Unity and Order**: By emphasizing these customs, Paul was likely seeking to prevent division within the early Christian community in Corinth. A key goal was to ensure that the behavior of the believers in worship did not cause confusion, disrupt social order, or undermine the community's reputation in the eyes of outsiders. Paul's focus was on creating a worship setting that was orderly, respectable, and reflective of the community's values.

### 4. **Paul's Theological Reasoning**

Paul’s instructions are not just rooted in cultural pragmatism; he also provides theological reasoning that reflects his interpretation of divine order:

- **Creation Order and Authority**: In 1 Corinthians 11:7-10, Paul justifies his directives by appealing to the creation order in Genesis, where he describes man as the image and glory of God and woman as the glory of man. He implies that these coverings reflect a divine hierarchy: just as God is the head of Christ, and Christ is the head of man, so man is the head of woman. Thus, head coverings (or the absence thereof) serve as symbols of this hierarchy in a visible, practical way during worship.

- **Angelic Witness**: Paul also mentions that "because of the angels," women should have a sign of authority on their heads (1 Corinthians 11:10). This cryptic statement could suggest that in the heavenly realm, divine order and modesty are observed and expected to be mirrored on earth, especially in worship settings where angels are thought to be present.

### 5. **Implications for Early Christian Identity**

Paul’s teachings on head coverings were likely a response to the need for the early Christians to navigate their new identity in a multi-cultural world. His advice reflects a careful balancing act between the need to respect and sometimes accommodate local customs and the desire to establish a distinctive Christian practice that reflects the community's theological beliefs and values.

### Conclusion

When explaining this to others, you can emphasize that Paul’s instructions on head coverings were deeply influenced by the cultural norms, social dynamics, and religious practices of his time. They were specific to the Greco-Roman context of early Christian communities, aiming to maintain order, avoid scandal, and reflect a particular theological viewpoint. This differs significantly from the Mosaic teachings in the Torah, where head coverings and specific garments were about maintaining holiness and sanctification before God. Understanding these differences can help clarify why Paul's teachings may conflict with earlier biblical instructions and why some practices, such as the removal of head coverings when the Bible is present, are rooted in Pauline tradition rather than in the Mosaic Law.
