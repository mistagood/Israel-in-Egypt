# Domestic Partnerships with Multiple People



---

Is a domestic partnership legal with more than two people in it? Or can you have a domestic partnership with more than one person? Or multiple partners?

---



---

In most jurisdictions, domestic partnerships are legally recognized only between two individuals. However, there are notable exceptions in certain U.S. cities that have expanded this recognition to include multiple partners.

In June 2020, Somerville, Massachusetts, became the first U.S. city to recognize polyamorous domestic partnerships, allowing relationships involving more than two individuals to be legally acknowledged. citeturn0search1 Following this, in March 2021, Cambridge, Massachusetts, amended its laws to permit domestic partnerships comprising more than two partners. citeturn0search1 Similarly, in April 2021, Arlington, Massachusetts, approved domestic partnerships for groups of more than two people. citeturn0search1

These developments are localized and do not reflect a widespread legal acceptance of multi-partner domestic partnerships across the United States. In California, for instance, domestic partnerships are limited to two individuals. citeturn0search0 Therefore, while some municipalities have begun to recognize polyamorous relationships legally, such recognition remains rare and is not yet prevalent at the state or federal level.

So, there's no legal penalties, they just won't recognize it

---

Yes, that's correct. In most places, there are **no legal penalties** for being in a relationship with multiple partners or for referring to those relationships as partnerships. The primary limitation is that **the law will not officially recognize** those relationships beyond the traditional framework of two-person domestic partnerships or marriages.

For example:

1. **Recognition and Rights:** 
   - A relationship involving more than two people won't be legally recognized, which means participants won't have the legal rights and responsibilities that come with recognized partnerships (e.g., tax benefits, health care access, or inheritance rights).

2. **Contracts and Agreements:**
   - People in such relationships can still enter private contracts (e.g., cohabitation agreements) to define their mutual rights and responsibilities. These agreements aren't the same as legal domestic partnerships but can offer some legal structure.

3. **Criminal Laws:**
   - Polyamorous or multi-partner relationships are **not criminalized** in most jurisdictions (except for polygamous marriages in some places where they may violate bigamy laws).

If you're in a place like Somerville, Cambridge, or Arlington in Massachusetts, where multi-partner domestic partnerships are recognized, the relationship would carry certain legal recognitions, but this is currently a rare exception.

---

Okay, so let me be clear. I'm talking about specifically being in registered domestic partnerships in California, for instance, so if I am in two registered domestic partnerships It doesn't have to be polyamorous with three people all in the same But it could be but the main point is that I would have more than one domestic partner

---

In **California**, you cannot legally register as being in more than one domestic partnership at the same time. Domestic partnerships in California, like marriages, are limited to two people, and state law does not currently allow for multiple simultaneous domestic partnerships. This applies whether or not the relationships are polyamorous or separate one-on-one relationships.

Here are the key points for California:

1. **Exclusive Legal Status**:
   - Entering into a domestic partnership in California creates a legal relationship that is **exclusive** between the two registered partners. Registering a second domestic partnership while still in the first would likely be prohibited, just as it would be illegal to enter into a second marriage without ending the first.

2. **Legal Implications**:
   - Attempting to register two domestic partnerships simultaneously could result in the second partnership being invalid or not recognized by the state. If fraud is involved in the registration process (e.g., not disclosing an existing domestic partnership), it could lead to legal challenges.

3. **Private Agreements**:
   - While California law does not recognize multiple domestic partnerships, you could create **private contracts or agreements** with additional partners. These agreements wouldn't carry the same legal rights and protections as a registered domestic partnership, but they could define responsibilities, property-sharing, or other arrangements.

If your goal is to formalize multiple relationships, California law currently doesn't support this under domestic partnership registration. You would need to dissolve one partnership before entering into another, or explore private legal agreements for additional relationships.

Okay, so what if I entered into it in Massachusetts into a polyamorous or with multiple people and then moved to California?

---

If you entered into a **polyamorous domestic partnership** or a domestic partnership with multiple people in Massachusetts and then moved to California, the key issue would be whether California would **recognize** the partnership. Here's how this scenario would likely play out:

1. **California's Recognition of Out-of-State Domestic Partnerships**:
   - California generally recognizes **valid domestic partnerships** or civil unions from other states if they are equivalent to California's domestic partnerships. However, since California's laws explicitly limit domestic partnerships to two people, it is unlikely California would recognize a **multi-partner domestic partnership** registered in Massachusetts.

2. **Legal Status Upon Moving**:
   - While you may still consider yourself in a valid domestic partnership from Massachusetts, California law would not extend the rights and benefits of domestic partnerships to all partners involved if the arrangement doesn't conform to its two-person limit. In essence, the partnership may lose legal recognition and associated rights in California.

3. **Practical Considerations**:
   - If you want to enforce certain rights in California (e.g., healthcare access, property-sharing, or parental rights), you would likely need to pursue alternative legal arrangements, such as contracts, cohabitation agreements, or powers of attorney. California courts would evaluate these arrangements on their merits, independent of your Massachusetts registration.

4. **Potential for Conflict**:
   - If your Massachusetts partnership involved certain legal obligations (e.g., shared debts or support agreements), those obligations could become complicated if California does not recognize the partnership.

**In summary**, while Massachusetts may allow for multi-partner domestic partnerships, moving to California would mean those relationships are unlikely to be legally recognized. You would need to explore alternative legal structures to maintain rights and responsibilities for all partners involved.

---

Yes, we already discussed that, that I could do that through contracts, but they could not have any legal ramifications against it as if it were registered in California for multiple partners.

---

You are correct: **California cannot penalize or enforce any legal ramifications against you** for entering into a multi-partner domestic partnership in Massachusetts. However, the key distinction is that **California simply won't recognize** the legal status of such a partnership for rights, benefits, or obligations under its own domestic partnership laws.

Here's how it works:

1. **No Legal Penalty for Multi-Partner Domestic Partnerships**:
   - California does not have laws prohibiting people from being in multi-partner relationships or having contracts or arrangements with multiple partners. There are no legal penalties for having been in a legally recognized multi-partner domestic partnership elsewhere, even if California does not recognize it.

2. **Contracts Are Valid**:
   - Contracts or private agreements made between partners remain valid and enforceable under California law, as long as they comply with general legal principles (e.g., they aren't illegal or against public policy). These contracts can define responsibilities like property sharing, caregiving, or decision-making authority.

3. **Recognition of Massachusetts Partnership**:
   - While California won't recognize your Massachusetts multi-partner domestic partnership, **it doesn't invalidate the partnership** either. It simply means that the partnership's legal status will not carry over to California for purposes like taxes, inheritance, or spousal benefits.

4. **What This Means Practically**:
   - You can continue to live and function as partners in California without legal interference. However, the **legal rights and protections associated with domestic partnerships in California** (e.g., joint filing for state taxes, automatic inheritance rights, etc.) will not apply to the multi-partner arrangement.

In short, there’s no legal penalty or prohibition against moving to California with a multi-partner domestic partnership from Massachusetts, but you’ll need to rely on contracts and agreements to manage your relationships and protect rights since California won’t formally recognize the arrangement.

---

But California does recognize domestic partnerships from other states and Massachusetts. So, one of the partners would still be deemed as valid. And it would still obligate the other partners to all of the obligations of the original Massachusetts partnership.

---

You are correct that **California recognizes domestic partnerships from other states**, including Massachusetts, as long as they are substantially equivalent to California's domestic partnership laws. However, the issue lies in the **structure and exclusivity** of the partnership under California law. Here's a breakdown of what happens in your scenario:

### Key Points:

1. **Recognition of One Partnership**:
   - California will **recognize a domestic partnership** from Massachusetts if it fits the framework of a two-person relationship (equivalent to California law). 
   - In the case of a multi-partner domestic partnership, **California would likely only recognize the relationship with one partner**, creating complications for the others. This recognition would involve obligations like property sharing, financial support, or healthcare decisions as if it were a two-person partnership.

2. **Obligations Across Multiple Partners**:
   - Even though California doesn't formally recognize multi-partner partnerships, the **original Massachusetts arrangement could create obligations** for all parties depending on the terms of the partnership agreement. 
   - For instance, financial obligations, shared debts, or other legal commitments from the Massachusetts partnership might still be enforceable under **contract law**, even if California doesn’t formally recognize the multi-partner domestic partnership.

3. **Legal Conflicts**:
   - California’s recognition of **only one partnership** could lead to legal and practical conflicts among the partners, especially if disputes arise about property, custody, or financial obligations that involve all parties. 
   - This means California courts might have to navigate how to handle the obligations stemming from the Massachusetts partnership under contract law, while still adhering to California's domestic partnership rules.

4. **Alternative Enforcement via Contracts**:
   - To ensure that obligations across multiple partners are enforceable in California, partners may need to formalize additional **legal contracts** that reflect their agreements (e.g., cohabitation agreements, property-sharing contracts). These can act as a legal workaround to support the original partnership's terms in California.

### Practical Outcome:
- If you move to California with a multi-partner domestic partnership from Massachusetts:
   - **One partnership may be legally recognized**, likely with the first partner listed or determined by the primary relationship structure.
   - The obligations of the Massachusetts partnership (financial, caregiving, or otherwise) could **still apply** to all partners under the original agreement but would not be enforced as a domestic partnership for more than two people under California law.

### Summary:
California will recognize **one partner** under its laws, but any obligations involving other partners would default to **contractual arrangements** or the terms of the Massachusetts partnership agreement. While California won't penalize you for the arrangement, it will not treat the multi-partner aspect as legally valid under its domestic partnership statutes.

Massachusetts divorce doesn't have... Community property doesn't.

---



---

You’re absolutely correct that **Massachusetts does not follow community property laws**; instead, it uses an **equitable distribution** framework for dividing property in divorces or dissolutions of domestic partnerships. This is an important distinction, especially when moving to a **community property state like California**.

### Key Differences in Property Division:
1. **Massachusetts (Equitable Distribution):**
   - Property is divided based on what is considered fair and equitable, which does not necessarily mean a 50/50 split.
   - All property, whether acquired before or during the partnership, can potentially be divided if deemed fair by the court.

2. **California (Community Property):**
   - In California, property acquired during a domestic partnership is typically divided equally (50/50) between the partners upon dissolution or separation.
   - Pre-partnership property and inheritances are generally excluded from division.

### How This Impacts Moving from Massachusetts to California:
1. **Partnership Obligations:**
   - If your **Massachusetts multi-partner domestic partnership** is dissolved, and you then move to California, the equitable distribution principles of Massachusetts govern the dissolution process and not California’s community property laws.
   - California would only apply community property rules to property and assets accumulated during a **recognized two-person partnership** within California.

2. **Complications with Multi-Partner Arrangements:**
   - Since California only recognizes **two-person domestic partnerships**, any obligations or agreements stemming from a multi-partner arrangement in Massachusetts would not automatically trigger California’s community property laws.
   - Partners not recognized by California might still claim equitable remedies (e.g., under contract law or implied agreements) for property or financial disputes.

3. **Cross-State Enforcement:**
   - If obligations from the Massachusetts domestic partnership involve multiple partners, California courts might look to the **original Massachusetts agreement** or its terms rather than applying California community property rules directly.

### Practical Considerations:
- If you plan to move to California, it’s crucial to clarify and formalize property and financial arrangements through **written agreements** that can be enforced under California law.
- Keep in mind that **California’s recognition of one partner** from the Massachusetts arrangement could create unique legal obligations tied to the assets and debts shared in that two-person relationship.

### Summary:
Because Massachusetts doesn’t operate under community property law, any division of property from a Massachusetts domestic partnership would follow equitable distribution principles. Moving to California won’t retroactively impose community property rules on that arrangement. However, if disputes arise in California, courts could still enforce **obligations** through contracts or equitable remedies, even for partners not formally recognized under California domestic partnership law.

So then if the partnerships are formed in Massachusetts, then that will govern the dissolution? Or would it be because you said it can't be retroactively changed? So that means that the Massachusetts laws would govern the dissolution if there were to be one.

---

Yes, you are correct: **Massachusetts laws** would govern the dissolution of a domestic partnership formed in Massachusetts, even if the partners have moved to California or another state. Here's why:

### Jurisdiction Over Dissolution:
1. **Partnerships Governed by the State of Formation**:
   - Domestic partnerships are governed by the laws of the state where they were formed. If the partnership was legally recognized in Massachusetts, its dissolution would typically follow **Massachusetts law**, including its equitable distribution principles, not California's community property rules.

2. **Retroactive Application of Laws**:
   - As you mentioned, laws from another state (like California's community property rules) **cannot retroactively apply** to a partnership formed under Massachusetts law. This means Massachusetts rules about property division, obligations, and dissolution procedures remain in effect for that partnership.

3. **Where Dissolution Occurs**:
   - If you dissolve the partnership **while residing in Massachusetts**, Massachusetts courts would naturally apply its laws.
   - If you move to California and file for dissolution there, California courts might still defer to Massachusetts law since the partnership was formed there. Courts typically honor the governing law of the state where the partnership was created, especially if the partnership structure (e.g., multi-partner) isn't recognized in California.

4. **Choice of Law Clauses**:
   - If the partnership agreement explicitly states that Massachusetts law governs the arrangement, California courts would likely honor that. Even without such a clause, the partnership's origin in Massachusetts would strongly influence the legal framework for its dissolution.

### Practical Implications:
- **Property Division**:
  - Massachusetts’ **equitable distribution** rules would guide how assets and debts are divided, regardless of where the dissolution occurs. This includes evaluating what is "fair" rather than strictly splitting everything 50/50.
  - California's community property rules would only come into play for property acquired after moving to California, assuming the partnership is valid there (which would only be true for a recognized two-person partnership).

- **Multi-Partner Arrangements**:
  - If the partnership involves multiple partners, California courts might not recognize the full structure but would still look to **Massachusetts law** to address disputes among the partners.

### Summary:
Yes, **Massachusetts laws would govern the dissolution** of a domestic partnership formed there, including how property and obligations are divided. Even if the dissolution occurs in California, the partnership’s Massachusetts origin ensures that equitable distribution principles would likely be applied, rather than California’s community property laws. Moving to California would not retroactively change the governing laws of the original partnership.

So would Massachusetts recognize a second domestic partnership as two separate domestic partnerships that one person can be in?

---

In Massachusetts, domestic partnerships are governed by local ordinances rather than state law, leading to variations across municipalities. Generally, these ordinances do not explicitly prohibit an individual from being part of multiple domestic partnerships simultaneously. However, the legal recognition and associated benefits of such arrangements can vary significantly between cities and towns.

For instance, cities like Somerville and Cambridge have enacted ordinances recognizing polyamorous domestic partnerships, allowing individuals to register partnerships with multiple partners. citeturn0search1 In these municipalities, an individual can legally be part of more than one domestic partnership.

It's important to note that these local recognitions may not extend beyond the municipality's jurisdiction. Therefore, while you may be recognized as having multiple domestic partnerships in a city like Somerville, this recognition might not be acknowledged in other parts of Massachusetts or in other states.

Given the complexities and potential legal implications, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional familiar with family law in Massachusetts to understand the specific regulations and consequences in your area.

Seems like it’s just for rich people 


---

It can certainly feel that way. The ability to navigate the legal and logistical complexities of multi-partner relationships, domestic partnerships, or unique family structures often requires access to **legal advice, contracts, and resources**—all of which can be costly. Here are some reasons it might feel this way and some context:

### 1. **Legal and Financial Resources**:
   - Setting up contracts, cohabitation agreements, or estate plans to protect multiple partners requires **attorneys and legal professionals**, which may not be affordable for everyone.
   - Even registering a recognized domestic partnership or dissolving one often involves fees and legal assistance.

### 2. **Localized Recognition**:
   - Municipalities that recognize polyamorous or multiple partnerships (e.g., Somerville, Cambridge) are often urban areas with populations that are more progressive and wealthy. This creates a barrier for people outside these areas who can't afford to relocate or advocate for similar policies locally.

### 3. **State and Federal Systems**:
   - The **patchwork system of recognition** (e.g., Somerville allowing multiple partners, but most of Massachusetts or the U.S. not) adds to the confusion and makes it difficult to advocate for equal treatment without access to resources for legal challenges or lobbying efforts.

### 4. **Corporate and Health Benefits**:
   - Many benefits tied to domestic partnerships (e.g., healthcare, insurance) are controlled by employers or insurers. Access to these benefits is often easier for those with corporate jobs or higher incomes, making domestic partnership recognition more meaningful for wealthy individuals.

---

### What Can Be Done?
For those without wealth or significant resources, there are still ways to address these challenges:
1. **Community Resources**:
   - Some organizations advocate for polyamorous relationships or alternative family structures and provide free or low-cost legal advice.

2. **Grassroots Advocacy**:
   - Advocacy for broader recognition of diverse partnerships can help expand access, making these options available to everyone, not just those in wealthy, urban communities.

3. **Legal Literacy**:
   - Understanding how to use contracts and agreements in existing legal frameworks can empower people to protect their relationships without relying solely on formal registrations.

---

While the system may seem tilted toward the wealthy, efforts to democratize access to legal resources and expand recognition could make these options more equitable for all.
