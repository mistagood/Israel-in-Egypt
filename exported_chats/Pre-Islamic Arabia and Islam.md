# Pre-Islamic Arabia and Islam



---

What was the dominant religion before Muhammad came up with Islam? It seems that those are the descendants of Ishmael, so it may have been something close to what the Hebrews were practicing. Even their languages are close and many other practices. In fact, the Quran speaks of Jesus. So how far does it go back? It speaks of the patriarchs. Does it talk about Abraham, Moses, Isaac, Jacob even? So I'm trying to figure out where it came from.

The dominant religion in Arabia before the emergence of Islam under Muhammad was a mix of polytheism, tribal pagan practices, and a few minority monotheistic traditions like Judaism and Christianity. To understand Islam’s historical and theological roots, it’s crucial to explore the context of pre-Islamic Arabia and its connections to Abrahamic traditions.

### Pre-Islamic Religion in Arabia
1. **Paganism and Polytheism**:  
   The majority of pre-Islamic Arabs worshipped a variety of gods and goddesses, often tied to nature, tribal deities, and celestial bodies. The Kaaba in Mecca, long before Islam, was a center of worship for these deities. It housed idols like **Hubal**, **Al-Lat**, **Al-Uzza**, and **Manat**, who were widely revered.

2. **Monotheistic Influences**:  
   - **Judaism**: Jewish communities existed in parts of Arabia, especially in Medina (then Yathrib) and the southern region of Yemen. These communities were well-established and adhered to the Mosaic Law, preserving the Torah’s teachings.
   - **Christianity**: By Muhammad's time, Christianity had spread to parts of Arabia, particularly in the Najran region and among Arab tribes converted by Byzantine missionaries. These communities often followed heterodox forms of Christianity, such as **Nestorianism** or **Monophysitism**.
   - **Hanifism**: A lesser-known pre-Islamic tradition, **Hanifism**, referred to individuals who rejected polytheism and sought a pure monotheistic faith, claiming to follow the religion of **Abraham (Ibrahim)**. The Quran highlights the Hanif as precursors to Islam.

### Abrahamic Roots in Islam
The Quran explicitly connects its teachings to the patriarchs of the Hebrew Bible, presenting Islam as a restoration of the original monotheistic faith of Abraham. 

1. **Abraham (Ibrahim)**:
   - The Quran identifies Abraham as the first to submit to God’s will (a "Muslim" in the Quranic sense).  
   - It acknowledges Abraham's role in building the Kaaba with his son Ishmael (Ismail) as a house of worship for the one God.
   - Both Abraham and Ishmael are presented as forebears of monotheism in Arabia.

2. **Ishmael (Ismail)**:
   - The Quran emphasizes Ishmael as a prophet and an ancestor of Muhammad.  
   - Ishmael is credited with teaching the worship of one God to his descendants, forming an early monotheistic tradition among the Arabs.

3. **Other Patriarchs**:
   - The Quran mentions **Isaac (Ishaq)**, **Jacob (Yaqub)**, and **Joseph (Yusuf)**, affirming their prophethood and connection to the Abrahamic lineage.  
   - **Moses (Musa)** and **Jesus (Isa)** hold prominent roles, with Moses being a lawgiver and liberator, and Jesus being a revered prophet, though not divine.

4. **Shared Practices**:
   - Many Islamic practices, such as fasting, circumcision, and dietary laws, echo Jewish traditions.  
   - The central concept of **tawhid** (oneness of God) aligns closely with the Hebrew Shema: "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one."

### Connection to the Biblical Patriarchs
The Quran repeatedly emphasizes that its message is not new but a continuation of earlier revelations given to prophets like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. It portrays Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets," the final messenger in this Abrahamic line, sent to restore the monotheistic faith corrupted over time.

### How Far Back Does It Go?
Islam sees itself as the original, unaltered faith of submission to the one God, tracing its roots directly to Abraham. This perspective aligns with the Quran’s assertion that God sent prophets to every nation, delivering a consistent message of monotheism. Therefore:
   - Islam draws theological and ritualistic elements from Jewish and Christian traditions.
   - The Quran acknowledges the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel as prior divine scriptures, though it asserts that they have been altered or misunderstood over time.

### Conclusion
Islam is deeply rooted in Abrahamic traditions, particularly through its connection to Ishmael and Abraham. It emerged as a synthesis of existing Jewish, Christian, and Arabian monotheistic ideas while rejecting the prevalent polytheism of pre-Islamic Arabia. Its theological framework goes back to the patriarchs, and the Quran frames itself as a restoration of their original monotheism. This historical and spiritual lineage explains the Quran’s frequent references to figures like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.
