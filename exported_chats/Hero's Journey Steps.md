The Hero's Journey, or the monomyth, is a narrative framework proposed by Joseph Campbell in his book "The Hero with a Thousand Faces." It describes a common pattern found in many narratives worldwide, particularly in myths, legends, and even modern storytelling. The Hero's Journey typically consists of twelve steps, which are grouped into three main phases: Departure, Initiation, and Return.

1. **Departure (or The Call to Adventure)**: The hero starts in the ordinary world, and the call to adventure is the event or trigger that begins the hero's quest.
   
2. **Refusal of the Call**: Initially, the hero may hesitate or refuse the call due to fear, insecurity, or a sense of duty or obligation in their ordinary life.

3. **Meeting with the Mentor**: The hero encounters a mentor figure who provides advice, training, or magical gifts to help on the journey.

4. **Crossing the First Threshold**: The hero commits to the journey and crosses from the ordinary world into the world of the adventure or the unknown.

5. **Belly of the Whale**: This represents the hero's final separation from their ordinary world and life. It's often a moment of rebirth or transformation.

6. **Initiation (or The Road of Trials)**: The hero faces a series of tests, trials, or challenges that they must overcome, often learning and growing in the process.

7. **Meeting with the Goddess/ The Temptation**: The hero experiences love or temptation that could distract or detract from their quest.

8. **Atonement with the Father/Abyss**: The hero must confront whatever holds the ultimate power in their life; this is often a figure or entity that represents authority or fatherhood.

9. **Apotheosis**: The hero experiences a period of rest, peace, or fulfillment before the final climax of the journey.

10. **The Ultimate Boon**: The hero achieves the goal of their quest. It could be a physical item or knowledge or insight that can benefit the ordinary world.

11. **Return (Refusal of the Return)**: Having achieved the goal, the hero may not want to return to the ordinary world with the boon.

12. **The Magic Flight**: The hero's return may be just as adventurous and dangerous as the journey outward.

13. **Rescue from Without**: The hero may need to be rescued or assisted by someone from the outside to bring them back to the ordinary world.

14. **Crossing the Return Threshold**: The hero must retain wisdom gained on the quest and integrate that wisdom into their ordinary life.

15. **Master of Two Worlds**: The hero achieves a balance between the material and spiritual (the inner and outer world) and becomes comfortable in both worlds.

16. **Freedom to Live**: The hero is liberated from the fear of death, which in turn radiates freedom to live.

These steps provide a flexible framework that can be adapted to various stories, not all stories will include all these steps, and they may occur in different orders.
