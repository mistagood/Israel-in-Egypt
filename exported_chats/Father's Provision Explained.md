a stone instead of bread, Being a good father

You're referring to Jesus' teaching about God's nature as a good Father, using the metaphor of giving **bread instead of a stone** — a key concept about divine provision and trust. The full passage is found in **Matthew 7:9–11** (with parallels in Luke 11):

### **Matthew 7:9–11 (KJV)**  
> **9** Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?  
> **10** Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  
> **11** If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, **how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?**

### Breakdown:

- **Bread vs. Stone**: Bread represents sustenance, care, and life. A stone is useless, hard, and inedible. This contrast sets the tone: a loving father doesn’t mock or harm his child’s need.
- **Fish vs. Serpent**: Another contrast between what is nourishing (fish) and what is dangerous or deceptive (serpent).
- **“Being evil”**: Even flawed human parents generally know how to care for their children. Jesus uses this lesser-to-greater argument: **If even you do this... how much more will God**?
- **Theological Insight**: God is not a deceiver. He doesn't give false, harmful substitutes when asked for real help. His response is aligned with life and truth.

### Hebrew Consideration:

While the New Testament is in Greek, this teaching echoes the **Hebrew concept of fatherhood** found throughout the Tanakh:

- **Deuteronomy 8:3** — *"Man does not live by bread only..."* — God fed Israel with manna to teach dependence on Him, not mere physical provision.
- **Psalm 103:13** — *"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him."*
- **Exodus 4:22** — *"Israel is my son, even my firstborn."*

These show that the image of God as a provider-father is deep in the Hebrew tradition. Jesus amplifies it by saying the Father gives **not just what is good, but what is better** than we know to ask.

If you’re connecting this with deeper symbolic meaning (e.g. stones = hardened hearts, or false gifts), or want it tied to Numbers/Revelation structure, I can align that too. Let me know.
