Let's look at the mythology of Lilith in Astrology and as Adam's wife.

Lilith is a fascinating example of how myth, scripture, and astrology merge into one shimmering archetype—part rebel, part warning, part mirror.  

In Jewish tradition, Lilith originates not from the canonical Bible but from post-biblical and mystical texts, especially the *Alphabet of Ben Sira* (circa 8th–10th century CE) and earlier Babylonian and Sumerian mythologies. There, she’s said to be Adam’s first wife—created from the same earth as him, not from his rib. When Adam demanded she “lie beneath him,” she refused, declaring them equals. Speaking the Ineffable Name of God, she fled Eden. Angels were sent to retrieve her, but she refused to return, claiming dominion over newborns and asserting independence from Adam’s authority.  

This version blends with older Mesopotamian spirits like the *Lilu* or *Lilitu*—female wind or night demons associated with storms, disease, and unbridled sexuality. Over time, Jewish mysticism (especially the Zohar) and Christian folklore turned Lilith into a nocturnal seductress, a “first Eve” who prefigures temptation itself.  

In astrology, “Lilith” has several incarnations:
1. **The Black Moon Lilith** — not a body, but a calculated point in the Moon’s orbit, representing the lunar apogee (the Moon’s farthest point from Earth). It symbolizes the wild, instinctual feminine—what refuses to be tamed or subordinated. Where it falls in a birth chart shows where someone resists control, refuses compromise, or confronts primal truths about autonomy and desire.  
2. **The Asteroid Lilith** (1181 Lilith) — a minor planet that can be interpreted as a more externalized or social expression of the same principle.  
3. **The Dark Moon Lilith (Waldemath’s Moon)** — a hypothetical second satellite of Earth sometimes used in esoteric astrology, representing psychic shadow and taboo emotions.  

Each of these “Liliths” is less about demonology and more about integration. She represents the unassimilated—those parts of ourselves and our histories deemed unacceptable, especially in relation to sexuality, gender, and power.  

Theologically, the myth reflects an anxiety over equality in creation. In Genesis 2, Eve is made from Adam’s rib—subordinate, relational. Lilith, however, arises from the same clay: coequal. Her exile becomes a mythic metaphor for the suppression of balance in masculine–feminine polarity.  

In a chart, Lilith’s placement often points to where a person’s independence, rage, or truth refuses to bow. It’s also where collective guilt and projection gather. For instance:
- **In Scorpio:** power over the hidden, mastery of taboo.
- **In Aries:** assertion of self at all costs.
- **In Cancer:** rebellion against domestic expectations.
- **In Capricorn:** refusal of imposed hierarchies or gendered authority.  

In short, Lilith in myth is the story of what happens when creation demands submission and the creature refuses. In astrology, she marks where the soul remembers that refusal—and learns to wield it wisely.  

If you want, we can trace Lilith’s evolution directly from Sumerian *Lilitu* through Ben Sira and Kabbalah into Renaissance and modern astrological thought, showing how each era reshaped her meaning.
