I need to create a very cool anime version avatar of myself who is reminiscent of a very fit, swole, like guru type who's still hip and cool even though those are not real good words to use cause they're not hip and cool but basically I want him to look stylish and modern as well as reflect the aura of class and the most interesting man in the world like if James Bond was an Indian and black dude

Got it. You want an anime-style avatar that channels a mix of strength, wisdom, and style — a kind of modern sage with the charisma of “the most interesting man in the world,” but rooted in your own look. Based on the photos you shared, here’s how I’d define the design elements for the avatar so it hits the right notes:

**Core Look**
- **Face/Beard:** Keep the full silver beard as a centerpiece — stylized with sharp anime linework so it looks regal, like a sign of power and wisdom. Accentuate cheekbones and jawline to make it more striking.  
- **Glasses:** Strong black frames, but slightly stylized to look like a mix between intellectual and battle-ready (think “scholar warrior” aesthetic).  
- **Pipe:** Make it a signature prop. In anime, props often symbolize aura — your pipe could emit subtle smoke wisps that curl into symbolic shapes (trees, constellations, ancient script).  

**Physique & Aura**
- **Build:** Clearly swole and fit — shoulders broad, arms powerful, but not exaggerated like Dragon Ball; more grounded, like a martial arts master.  
- **Aura:** A faint glow — perhaps silver with indigo undertones — emanating like a halo or ripple, suggesting wisdom and hidden power.  

**Style**
- **Clothing:** A fusion of modern and traditional: fitted dark shirt (like the one in your photos) with subtle stylized patterns (geometric or tribal lines) running across shoulders or chest. Could have a jacket draped over shoulders, James Bond style.  
- **Hair:** Keep the pulled-back tied look, but exaggerate with cleaner, shinier strands that show discipline and order. The tied sections could even look like “nodes of power,” glowing faintly.  

**Vibe**
- Imagine a blend of:  
  - Muten Roshi (Dragon Ball) if he were *young and built*,  
  - Samuel L. Jackson’s gravitas,  
  - plus Bond-like sleekness.  
- The final effect: a character who looks like he can sit in a jazz lounge with elegance, then step into a temple and hold his own as a guardian.  

Do you want me to go ahead and generate a first anime-style render of this concept for you, using one of your uploaded photos as a base reference?
