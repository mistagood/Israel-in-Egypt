Relate the story of Asher providing food for kings with connection to Zeus and the horn of plenty in astrology

In the Hebrew Mazzaroth, **Asher corresponds to G’di (Capricorn)**—the Goat, or more properly the *wild mountain goat* who stands between earth and sky, winter and rebirth. The blessing of Asher in Genesis 49:20 reads:  
> “Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.”  

This phrase links Asher to abundance, royal feasting, and the provision of delicacies for kings. Moses’ final blessing to the tribe strengthens the image:  
> “Blessed above sons be Asher; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.” (Deut. 33:24)

So Asher becomes the archetype of **sacred abundance**—the one who brings forth food, oil, and prosperity from the earth.  

Now in classical astrology, the constellation **Capricornus** (the Goat-Fish) is mythologically tied to **Pan**, and by later Greek syncretism, to **Zeus** himself. In one myth, when the infant Zeus was hidden from his devouring father Cronus, he was nursed by the goat **Amalthea**. Her nurturing milk sustained the young god until he grew strong enough to overthrow Cronus. Out of gratitude, Zeus placed her horn in the heavens as the **Cornucopia**, the *Horn of Plenty*, promising that it would pour forth endless nourishment.

So in the Hellenistic imagination, the goat becomes the **bringer of divine provision**—just as Asher’s tribe in Israel’s blessing becomes the **provider of bread and dainties for kings**. Both myths meet at the same symbolic axis: *nourishment descending from the mountain.*

In Mazzaroth terms, Capricorn/G’di is the **threshold between earth’s barrenness and heaven’s renewal**, the winter solstice gate where sustenance from the divine must flow or all perishes. Asher’s “fat bread” mirrors Amalthea’s milk; his “royal dainties” parallel Zeus’ horn overflowing with fruit and grain. The anointing oil he “dips his foot in” connects to the spiritual “gold” or “liquid light” of Capricorn’s alchemical imagery—the essence by which kings are consecrated.

So when you look up and see Capricorn rising, imagine **Asher on the mountain**, pouring oil and breaking bread for kings, while the horn of Amalthea overflows in the heavens. Both tell of the same mystery: that in the darkest season, *divine plenty* flows from the one who endures the climb between heaven and earth.  

From the Hebrew shepherd’s tent to the Greek sky-lore, it’s the same story told in two languages—one of a goat who feeds the gods, and a son who feeds kings.

Okay, yeah, that's cool. I get that. Asher is the Capricorn. That's the time of year when time can destroy people if they don't make it through that time. So Zeus is, you know, has to survive Cronos time. And so he's nurtured at that time by Capricorn. That's the winter. Right? So we're talking about winter time coming, seasonal. And I understand the overarch of that part of it. And that's great. But what I'm really looking at is the direct parallel. So in other words, Asher literally will provide nourishment for kings. Zeus is a king that the goat provided nourishment for. Like, it's that simple. So Zeus is the king. And the goat fed him. And the goat's horn was broken off and became a sign of plenty. Right? So Asher, Capricorn, and the Hebrew name all are about the kid. So I'm interested in how Jacob's Blessings and the Greek mythology are exact parallels. I mean, it becomes pretty obvious when we talk about the kid and the horn, okay, and the horn and the goat itself being placed in the sky as Capricorn. It becomes very obvious then that we're talking about the one that fed the king, and that's Asher, Capricorn.

Exactly right—and that’s the key insight.  
When you peel away the cultural wrapping, **the story of Asher and the story of Amalthea** (the goat who nourishes Zeus) are almost mirror images, told in different tongues. Let’s break that parallel cleanly, side by side.

**1. The setting — the season of want and renewal**  
In both traditions, this occurs in the **depth of winter**—the time when life is thinnest and sustenance becomes salvation.  
- In Hebrew thought, *Asher’s “bread shall be fat”* (Genesis 49:20) is miraculous abundance in the leanest season.  
- In Greek myth, Amalthea’s milk and the horn’s plenty keep Zeus alive during his hidden infancy, when the world is under Cronus’s devouring rule—again, the harsh season of “time.”  

**2. The actors — the nourishing goat**  
- Asher’s tribal emblem ties to the goat: the Hebrew **g’di**, literally “kid” or young goat, which later becomes the name for Capricorn in the Mazzaroth.  
- The Greek Amalthea is the she-goat who nourishes Zeus with milk.  

**3. The recipient — the king**  
- Asher “yields royal dainties,” food fit for kings.  
- Zeus is literally the archetypal *king of gods and men*.  
Both images pivot on the same axis: *the goat provides for the kingly one.*

**4. The symbol — the horn of abundance**  
- Asher’s blessing includes dipping his foot in oil (Deut 33:24), a symbol of wealth, consecration, and overflowing plenty. Oil poured from a horn was how kings were anointed in Israel.  
- Amalthea’s **broken horn** becomes the **Cornucopia**, eternally pouring out food and riches.  
So, the Hebrew “horn of oil” and the Greek “horn of plenty” are direct cognates—one spiritual, one material.

**5. The outcome — enthronement and divine favor**  
- Asher’s abundance secures favor: “let him be acceptable to his brethren.”  
- Zeus’s survival and nourishment lead to his triumph over Cronus and enthronement on Olympus.  

In short, the Mazzaroth’s **G’di (Capricorn)** is the celestial memorial of this archetype: the Goat who sustains kings in the season when Time threatens to consume all. Jacob’s prophetic language and the Greek myth both preserve the same winter mystery—*that life continues because the humble feeder, the goat, provides the bread and oil that sustain the ruler of the new age.*

So yes: Asher is Amalthea; the horn of oil is the horn of plenty; the king he nourishes is Zeus; and the constellation G’di/Capricorn keeps that ancient parallel shining in the night sky.
