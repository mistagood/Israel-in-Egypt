What's the land equivalent of shrimp, lobster, and crab?

On land, the closest ecological equivalents to shrimp, lobster, and crab would be the scavenger and detritivore species that clean up dead matter, much like these crustaceans do in aquatic environments.  

- **Shrimp equivalent:** small insect scavengers such as beetles (especially carrion beetles) and woodlice/pillbugs (terrestrial crustaceans themselves).  
- **Lobster equivalent:** larger scavenging arthropods like certain land crabs (in tropical regions) or big predatory beetles.  
- **Crab equivalent:** terrestrial crustaceans such as coconut crabs or fiddler crabs on shorelines; in a purely insect category, it would be something like crickets or roaches that eat a wide variety of decaying organic matter.  

From a food-safety and biblical dietary-law standpoint, these land equivalents would be the *“creeping things”* or *“winged swarming things”* mentioned in Leviticus 11—animals that crawl close to the ground, often on many legs, and feed on waste or decaying organic matter. They function as the land-based cleanup crew, just as shrimp, lobster, and crab do in water.
