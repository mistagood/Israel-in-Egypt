Does the Hebrew Mazaroth have names for the constellations?

Yes, the Hebrew *Mazzaroth* (מַזָּרוֹת)—a term that appears in Job 38:32—refers to the band of constellations along the ecliptic, essentially what we now call the zodiac. The Bible doesn’t preserve a full official list of constellation names, but fragments survive in Hebrew, Aramaic, and later rabbinic sources that align with known zodiacal figures.  

The ancient Hebrew system was not identical to the Greek zodiac, but many names correspond closely. Here’s how the traditional *Mazzaroth* is reconstructed from scriptural, Second Temple, and medieval Hebrew sources (with approximate modern equivalents):  

| Hebrew (transliterated) | Meaning or Description | Rough Greek/Latin Equivalent |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Taleh (טָלֶה)** | “Lamb” or “Ram” | Aries |
| **Shor (שׁוֹר)** | “Bull” | Taurus |
| **Te’omim (תְּאוֹמִים)** | “Twins” | Gemini |
| **Sartan (סַרְטָן)** | “Crab” | Cancer |
| **Ari (אַרְיֵה)** | “Lion” | Leo |
| **Betulah (בְּתוּלָה)** | “Virgin” | Virgo |
| **Moznayim (מֹאזְנַיִם)** | “Scales” | Libra |
| **‘Akrav (עַקְרָב)** | “Scorpion” | Scorpio |
| **Keshet (קֶשֶׁת)** | “Bow” | Sagittarius |
| **G’di (גְּדִי)** | “Kid (Goat)” | Capricorn |
| **D’li (דְּלִי)** | “Water-bucket” | Aquarius |
| **Dagim (דָּגִים)** | “Fishes” | Pisces |

The thirteenth constellation, **Ophiuchus**, isn’t mentioned by name in Hebrew literature but sometimes appears conceptually in *Midrashim* and star lore connected with **“Nachash”** (נָחָשׁ, “serpent”) and **“Ish ha-Nachash”** (“man with the serpent”). That concept bridges into your Dan–Ophiuchus framework: a serpent-bearing figure between *Moznayim* (Libra) and *Keshet* (Sagittarius).

The names above show that the *Mazzaroth* was a Hebrewized version of a wider Near Eastern stellar map, adapted with Israelite linguistic and theological framing rather than Greek mythic identities.
