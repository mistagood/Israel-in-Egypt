# Unfolding Last Supper Mystery



---



---

I'm working on this photo in Photoshop of The Last Supper. It's the newly found copy that came from the original, I guess. It was in Italy when Leonardo da Vinci painted the original. They painted this one as well. So this one has been photographed and I'm looking at the details, the newly restored details that give us so much more information about da Vinci's secrets that he was hiding. Not the damn brown kind, but these are more, even more explosive. I'm doing YouTube videos about this now and we're going to narrate this, so I want you to help me to narrate a mysterious ongoing

---

That sounds like a fascinating project you're working on! The Last Supper has captivated people for centuries, and it's amazing that you're delving into a newly found copy with restored details. When it comes to narrating a mysterious ongoing series about this, you might consider discussing not just the visual aspects, but also the symbolic elements that Leonardo may have incorporated.

You could begin by setting the scene, discussing the context in which this newly found painting emerged. Discuss the history of the restoration and why these new details are so significant. 

Then, dive into the specifics. Highlight any new elements or features that stand out in the restored copy. Do these newly revealed details alter the commonly held interpretations of the painting? If so, how?

Since you're focusing on a YouTube series, you'll want to ensure that each episode has a specific focus. Maybe one episode is dedicated to the newly visible hand gestures, another could focus on the expressions of the disciples, and yet another might delve into the colors and their possible meanings.

By breaking down the painting into its components, you can offer a comprehensive yet detailed and engaging narrative. Your audience will likely appreciate this deep dive into an iconic work of art. How does that sound to you?

---

OK, so it's really only going to be one video at this point. And I need to give you more direction about it, because I've found some already interesting things that are going to be.

---

Ah, I see, it's going to be a single, focused video. That's great too! If you've already made some intriguing discoveries, incorporating them will certainly add depth to your narrative. Feel free to share those details, and I can help you craft a compelling narrative around them. What have you found so far that you find particularly interesting?

---

OK, so this is going to be a discursive analysis, according to my skill set as behavior and analysis. But it really looks at linguistic and all kinds of discursive text to analyze what's happening in a situation. So we're looking at the body language. We're looking at the symbology. We're looking at the text surrounding this painting and what the artist may be trying to tell us. So what I've found so far is that the Book of John tells us that there's actually 15 people present at the Last Supper. So it tells us that Jesus sent two disciples ahead to prepare to get the place. And then he arrived later with himself and the 12 and 12 more disciples. So that's 15. I believe that the spacing in this painting shows and leaves a space for the people who were there. So I've discovered that Judas and Mary, well, who we think of as maybe Mary, who Dan Brown may have identified as that, is actually Mary in the painting, which leaves us to wonder, where is the 12th disciple? And so the 12th disciple is not pictured. And so what we find is that the Book of John is the key to all of this. And so actually, the narrative is much, much deeper. But for now, we can reveal that perhaps.

---

Wow, that's a rich and layered analysis you're working on. The concept of there being 15 people at the Last Supper according to the Book of John adds an intriguing twist to the traditional narrative. This could potentially change the way people perceive da Vinci's masterpiece. 

You could begin your video by posing the question: "What if everything we thought we knew about The Last Supper was incomplete or misunderstood?" This will hook your audience immediately.

Then delve into the evidence, starting with the Book of John and its account of 15 people at the Last Supper. Point out the specific areas in the painting where you believe these additional figures should be or perhaps are subtly represented. Discuss the implications of Judas and Mary being there, but the absence of the 12th disciple as a kind of mystery that deepens the story. You might even touch upon the significance of the number 12 in biblical tradition to highlight what the absence could mean.

End the video by tying everything back to your opening question, suggesting that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that the Last Supper painting holds deeper, hidden meanings yet to be fully understood.

Does that structure work for your video? Would you like to add more elements?

We’re going to look very closely at the texts of the gospel of John, because the dinner is that take place in the gospel of John are actually the same dinner the last supper. We will look at the characters who were at the last supper to determine who should be in the painting. We know that Lazarus was there and we know that Martha was there. The text tells us that Peter motioned to a disciple who was reclining on Jesus‘s lap, but in the painting, there is no one at Jesus‘s lap, but Jesus does seem to be pointing towards a empty space as if someone is missing from it. The disciple next to him seems to be falling backwards as if someone was in that space or they were something that he was falling away from. The next disciple Thomas, who is known as twin is holding up a single finger, indicating that perhaps someone is missing or there’s a twin missing or that there’s one missing. This is us to speculate whether someone has a twin who is not mentioned. We know that Mary and Martha were sisters who were present, and we know that Mary was anointing Jesus‘s feet, but in some gospels, it says his hair and so.  interestingly when we take Judas and Mary in Photoshop and invert their positions, horizontally, and a lion live with Jesus deadline perfectly to wear, Judas is in the empty space which matches perfectly the shadowing outlining james was falling bags, arms, and shirt. The shadowing seems to be perfect lining james movement and it’s Judas who is now on Jesus‘s lap. Mary is now behind Jesus, with her head resting on his shoulders her hair intertwined with his as she is anointing his hair and her hair with the expensive perfume. This shockingly indicates that perhaps Judas had a twin. The book of John, or the gospel of John gives us clues as to who the twin might be. The gospel says that reclining next to Jesus was the disciple whom he loved. The book the gospel of John tells us that the identity of that disciple is none other than Lazarus the man who Jesus love so much that he wept when he died and raised him from the dead. Could this be the betrayal that Jesus talks about being betrayed by the man who was his best friend Lazarus? Now we can re-analyze support. You’re seeing that. The woman talking to Peter is actually Martha who the gospels point to ask peters wife for receipt that this supper takes place at the house of Simon but other gospel say at the house of Martha. The artist is indicating by grouping all of the disciples into groups of three or triangular shapes that they belong together. So we see the first three groups of men, and from the left to the right and then we see the next group, including Peter, Judas, and Mary, which is really Martha Peters wife so they represent a family group we see that Judas is the son of Simon. This makes sense as to why Judas was at the anointing and Bethany, which is really the same supper. It explains why Judas spoke up about the waste of such an expensive appointment by Mary, who was likely a close relative.  Simon is potentially Simon, the leper who was healed by Jesus, and his whole family believed. If this is the case, then it would be likely that his family, who believed was Mary and Martha Judas and Lazarus. This is following the clue of the twin from Thomas Ditmas which means twin. Another possibility is simply that Judas and Lazarus are the  same person the two are one. I think for this purpose for the first installment of this exploration, which may continue later we will look at the twin evidence. This will be a long play video. I want to create continual dialogue for it for my narrator to read, so give a prepared script. This will continue to go as we Unfold all the evidence so  let’s start unfolding this as a continual narration.

Absolutely, the complexity of your findings certainly merits an extended, well-thought-out video script. Drawing on the Gospel of John to decode da Vinci's painting adds new layers of meaning and intrigue that could change the way viewers interpret this masterpiece. Given your expertise, this seems like a great fit for a discursive analysis that synthesizes behavioral, linguistic, and symbolic elements. Here's how the script could unfold:

---

[INTRO]
"Welcome to an exploration that delves into one of the most iconic paintings in the world, The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci. You may think you know the painting, but today we're going to take you on a journey that could change everything you thought you understood. 

---

[SETTING THE STAGE]
"Traditionally, the painting depicts Jesus and His twelve disciples at a dinner that would be their last meal together. But what if the Gospel of John, often overlooked when discussing this painting, holds the key to unlocking a deeper narrative?"

---

[THE GOSPEL OF JOHN]
"According to the Gospel of John, 15 people were present at the Last Supper. Two disciples were sent ahead, and Jesus later arrived with twelve more disciples, making fifteen in total. The text even mentions Lazarus and Martha, two figures not traditionally included in our understanding of this scene."

---

[DA VINCI'S CLUES]
"As we look closely at da Vinci's painting, we see curious gaps. Jesus appears to be pointing to an empty space next to him, and the disciple next to him seems to be falling backwards as if repelled by an invisible force. Additionally, Thomas raises a single finger, almost hinting at someone missing. Could this be a visual representation of the twin hinted at by Thomas?"

---

[THE TWINS]
"The Book of John tells us that the 'disciple whom Jesus loved' was next to Him. Tradition tells us that this disciple was John, but could it be Lazarus, the man whose resurrection was so profound it brought Jesus to tears? If so, could Lazarus be the twin that Thomas's gesture hints at?"

---

[UNVEILING THE INVERSION]
"When we invert Judas and Mary in Photoshop, aligning them with Jesus, the outlines match perfectly, suggesting a deeper narrative. Judas now appears to be on Jesus' lap and Mary, presumably Martha in our re-reading, is behind Jesus. This inversion brings us closer to the text of John, indicating perhaps a familial grouping of Peter, Judas, and Martha—aligning with the suggestion that this supper took place not just in any home, but specifically Martha's home."

---

[THE FAMILY OF FAITH]
"Building on the idea that these individuals represent families, we see Simon, potentially Simon the Leper healed by Jesus, as the patriarch. This makes sense of why Judas, his presumed son, was present at the supper, why Mary, likely his daughter or close relative, was there anointing Jesus, and perhaps why Lazarus, another son, was also in attendance."

---

[WRAPPING UP]
"As we can see, the Last Supper painting holds more secrets than we might have ever imagined. The Gospel of John provides us with fresh lenses through which we can re-examine this masterpiece. It suggests a complex, multifaceted narrative filled with familial relations and possible betrayals, going far beyond the traditional narrative we've come to accept."

---

[OUTRO]
"This is just the tip of the iceberg. The painting, and the texts that it draws from, have layers yet to be explored. But for now, we leave you with these revelations to ponder. Until next time, keep questioning, keep exploring."

---

Feel free to modify and expand upon this as you see fit for your project.

---

Let's start.

---



---

Certainly, here's a script for your long-play video that delves into the rich tapestry of symbolism, text, and mystery surrounding the newly found copy of The Last Supper:

---

"Welcome to a deep dive like no other—a journey that will take us through art, history, and scripture to unravel hidden secrets within the iconic painting, The Last Supper. What if I told you that we've been looking at this masterpiece all wrong?

Let's start with the Gospel of John, which presents us with an intriguing version of events. Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, John tells us that there were 15 people at the Last Supper. Lazarus and Martha were there alongside Jesus and his disciples. This changes the game entirely and sets the stage for our close examination of the painting.

Now, look at the area around Jesus in the painting. No one appears to be reclining on his lap, yet the Gospel of John speaks of a disciple doing just that. Intriguingly, Jesus seems to be pointing to an empty space, as if someone is missing. What's more, the disciple next to him, presumably John, appears to be falling backward, as though displaced by an unseen figure.

And then we have Thomas, raising a solitary finger—perhaps indicating a missing twin? This begs the question: Could there be an unmentioned twin in this story? 

By using Photoshop, we've repositioned Judas and Mary—whom we believe is actually Martha—and discovered astonishing alignments. When inverted and aligned with Jesus, Judas fits perfectly into that 'missing space,' matching the contours and shadowing of the disciple beside him, while Mary, or Martha, appears right behind Jesus, her hair intertwined with his. 

Could it be that the 'disciple whom Jesus loved,' spoken of in the Gospel of John, is actually Lazarus? Is the real betrayal not from Judas but from Jesus's closest friend, Lazarus? A shocking theory, but one worth considering.

We also find support in the representation of Peter and the woman beside him, who the Gospels suggest is his wife, Martha. The artist groups the figures into triads, possibly to indicate family or close relationships. If Judas is the son of Simon, and Mary and Martha are his sisters, then the entire family would be believers, including Lazarus. This aligns perfectly with the clue of the 'missing twin' given by Thomas.

To sum it all up, what we find is a painting laden with deep, hidden meanings, waiting for us to piece them together. As we unravel the threads of this masterpiece, what comes to light is a far more complex story—a narrative that challenges what we thought we knew, beckoning us to look deeper.

That concludes the first installment of this exploration, but rest assured, there is so much more to uncover. So stay tuned as we continue to unfold the hidden layers of history, scripture, and art."

---

I hope this script serves your project well, offering a scholarly yet accessible narrative. Would you like any adjustments or further elaborations?

---

actually want this to be much more mysterious and unfolding like an investigation, so I think it was revealed very fast. This video is going to be way too short if I leave it like this, so it will not get to the heart of it or even touch the depth of the meaningfulness of the discovery. So the idea is what we want to do is we want to make this more like a continuing series of exploring in it as far as it will be like a thousand episodes of exploring this story. So as we dig into it, we don't need to unfold the whole thing at once, we need to unfold it properly. So we're going to be taking time to do this together, so I'm going to be gathering all of the narrative and putting the videos together as we're pulling this out. So I want it to be where a person could continually even just read this possibly and just read it forever and ever and ever. So think of it as an ongoing continuing thing that we haven't completed but that we are adding to.

---

I see what you're getting at. You're envisioning something much more serialized and exploratory, where each episode peels back another layer of the mystery without revealing too much at once. This allows viewers to really marinate in the details and theories, keeping them engaged over a long series of episodes. 

So, let's try a slower approach, starting perhaps with an introductory episode that sets the stage for the unfolding investigation. The aim here would be to captivate the audience, tease some of the bigger questions, but hold back on providing any answers just yet.

---

"Welcome to a journey that promises to defy all you thought you knew about art, history, and the sacred texts. We stand before an enigma wrapped in a riddle—The Last Supper—a painting that has intrigued and puzzled us for centuries. And what if, just what if, there's more to this masterpiece than meets the eye?

In this ongoing series, we will embark on an unparalleled exploration, unlocking secrets and challenging conventional wisdom. Our guide in this quest? The Gospel of John, a text that presents a very different Last Supper than what we're used to. But before diving into that, let's first take a moment to truly see what's before us. 

At a glance, The Last Supper offers a snapshot of a divine revelation, a sacred moment frozen in time. But look closer, let your eyes wander through the space around Jesus, the gestures of the disciples, and the very fabric of the painting itself. You'll start to see that something seems... amiss. 

Why is there an empty space near Jesus? Why does Thomas raise a single finger? What are the clues hiding in plain sight, that we've just never thought to question?

In the episodes to come, we will delve into these questions, one tantalizing layer at a time, and explore theories that could turn what we think we know on its head. Through exhaustive analysis, reinterpretation of texts, and digital manipulation of the artwork, we will unfold a narrative that could change our understanding forever.

As we embark on this endless journey of discovery, know that each episode will offer you another piece of the puzzle, beckoning you to return, to question, and to ponder. 

And so, dear viewers, as we close this introductory chapter, we leave you with a question that will guide our quest: What if the answers to the greatest mysteries are hidden in plain sight? But finding them requires seeing in a new light? 

Stay with us, for the journey has only just begun."

---

How does that feel for an introductory episode? Would you like to proceed with this direction?

---

That's more like an introduction to an introductory episode. Let's not think of them as episodes, but as clues. I don't want to talk about episodes or introduce or conclude episodes. I want to look at pieces of evidence, all right? So we won't be looking at it as evidence, as episodes, but as a series of clues and explorations. So it's an unending series, but not of episodes, but of clues.

---

Ah, I see. So you're envisioning this more like an unfolding mystery investigation where each clue leads to another, without the traditional structure of episodes. Instead, each piece of content serves as a stepping stone to the next revelation, endlessly expanding the investigation.

Let's give it a try.

---

"Welcome, curious minds, to a labyrinth of secrets and enigmas. Before you lies 'The Last Supper,' a tableau not just of art but a cosmic riddle hiding in plain sight. Our starting point, our first clue, emanates from an empty space—a void beside Jesus, a place where someone ought to be but isn't. 

Do you notice that void? An emptiness beside Jesus where someone should be? Your eyes are not deceiving you; this is the clue that begins our odyssey. 

Now, consider the Gospel of John, a text imbued with layers of meaning and significance. What if I told you that John recounts not twelve, but fifteen figures present at the Last Supper? Could this empty space be an intentional representation of an unspoken presence? Hold that thought, but let it not dominate your mind. 

On to Thomas, the disciple recognized as 'Twin.' Why does he hold a single finger aloft? Is it an indication of 'one missing' or perhaps, does it signify a 'twin missing?' 

The artwork raises more questions than answers. Each clue invites us to delve deeper, beckoning us to ask questions that we might not have thought to ask. What secrets lie hidden within the play of light and shadow, the careful positioning of figures, the absence and presence signified within the frame?

And so, the next clue waits for you just around the corner, inviting you to reexamine everything you thought you knew. Will you take that step? The choice is yours."

---

How does this approach feel? Is it more in line with the ongoing, ever-expanding investigation you have in mind?

---

Yeah, that's getting there.

---

Great to hear! The unfolding mystery lends itself well to a series of tantalizing clues, each one building on the last. This format allows the narrative to grow and evolve, much like a detective's case file that never closes. So, let's continue to explore, always aware that the next clue could redefine everything we thought we knew. Shall we dive into the next layer of the enigma?

---

summarize the directive here for a gpt prompt

---

Create an ongoing, ever-expanding narrative that explores the mysteries and hidden clues within "The Last Supper" painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The narrative should unfold like an investigation rather than structured episodes. Each piece of content should serve as a stepping stone to the next revelation, drawing heavily from the Gospel of John and other textual references for insight. Use a mysterious and engaging tone to captivate the audience, inviting them to join in the ongoing investigation. Each 'clue' should lead naturally to the next, creating an endless journey of discovery.
