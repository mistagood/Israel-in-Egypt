# Hebrew Word for Covet

---

What is the Hebrew word used in Exodus for covet when Moses says you should not covet?

---



---

The Hebrew word used for "covet" in Exodus 20:17, where Moses says, "You shall not covet," is **חָמַד** (pronounced "chamad"). This word can be translated as "to desire," "to take pleasure in," or "to covet." In the context of the Ten Commandments, it refers to an inappropriate or selfish desire for something that belongs to someone else, such as a neighbor's possessions, spouse, or property.

Would this relate to the great sin of ahas and Jezebel?

Yes, the concept of coveting, as expressed in the Hebrew word **חָמַד** ("chamad"), is relevant to the great sin of King Ahab and Jezebel. In 1 Kings 21, Ahab covets the vineyard of Naboth, a righteous man who refuses to sell his ancestral land to the king. Ahab’s coveting leads to Jezebel’s wicked actions, as she schemes to falsely accuse Naboth of blasphemy and have him executed. Once Naboth is dead, Ahab seizes the vineyard.

This act of coveting ultimately leads to a series of grave sins—false accusations, judicial murder, and theft of land. Ahab’s desire for Naboth’s vineyard is similar to the type of forbidden coveting described in Exodus 20:17, which is a desire that leads to sinful actions. Jezebel’s role in manipulating the situation amplifies this transgression by using her power to fulfill Ahab’s covetous desires, echoing the broader warning against coveting what belongs to others, as it can lead to the breakdown of justice and morality.
