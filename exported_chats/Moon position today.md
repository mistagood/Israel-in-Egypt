So where's the moon today according to the IAU or the IUA divisions? IAU, I guess it is. Because I guess we're about to have a super moon.

You’re right to say IAU. Using the IAU’s official constellation boundaries (the “fenced-off” sky tiles, not zodiac signs), the Moon **today (Mon, Nov 3, 2025, LA time)** sits in **Dagim (Pisces)** — that’s the IAU constellation **Pisces** in our Mazzaroth map. citeturn1search0turn1search3 And it’s a bright **waxing gibbous (~95% lit)** on its way to full. citeturn1search1

Two beats ahead: the coming full Moon — the year’s closest “supermoon” — crests **Wednesday, Nov 5 at 5:19 a.m. PT**. Multiple astro outlets flag this as 2025’s nearest full Moon (perigee-aligned), i.e., the biggest/brightest of the year. citeturn0search8turn0news52 At that moment, by **IAU** boundaries the Moon will be in **Tleh (Aries)** (not Taurus), ~**356,979 km (221,817 mi)** from Earth. The “Taurus” label you’ll see in popular horoscopes is the tropical sign, not the IAU constellation. citeturn2search2

Quick glossary for our listeners:
- **Dagim (Pisces)** = the Fish; in your mapping, Ephraim & Manasseh. fileciteturn1file0L112-L116  
- **Tleh (Aries)** = the Lamb; in your mapping, Benjamin. fileciteturn1file1L65-L69  
- The **IAU** defines constellations as fixed sky areas with precise boundary lines — that’s why “Moon in Aries (IAU)” can differ from “Moon in Taurus (astrology).” citeturn1search13

So, headline answer: **Moon is in Dagim (Pisces) today**, sliding into **Tleh (Aries)** for the **Nov 5 supermoon** under IAU rules. citeturn1search0turn2search2

Want to riff on how Dagim → Tleh (Ephraim & Manasseh → Benjamin) fits your ecliptic narrative heading into the supermoon?

I want to talk about the effects of the moon, or the supermoon in fact, with Aries. And what we might be seeing happening right now.

Alright, on-air frame first:

- The full Moon peaks **Wed, Nov 5 at 5:19 a.m. PT**, and at that moment the Moon is in **Tleh (Aries)** by **IAU** boundaries, about **356,000 km** away (so: a bona-fide “supermoon”). The Sun sits opposite in **Moznayim (Libra)**, as expected for a full Moon. citeturn0search8turn2search16

- Physical effects you can point to: a perigean spring tide (aka “king tide”)—highs a bit higher and lows a bit lower than typical spring tides. The size of that bump depends on your coastline; in many places it’s only a couple inches, but it can be more when local factors stack up. citeturn1search0turn1search1turn1search9  
  On people: big claims about full Moons driving behavior don’t hold up well (ER visits, crime, etc.). What does show up is a small, repeatable **sleep effect** around the days before a full Moon—later bedtimes and slightly shorter sleep—seen even without moonlight cues. It’s modest, not mystical. citeturn4search11turn4search0

Now, the **Mazzaroth read** for a supermoon in **Tleh (Aries/Benjamin)** facing **Moznayim (Libra/Dan)**:

- **Axis: Exposure vs. Judgment.** Full Moons “floodlight” what’s already there. In your mapping, **Benjamin** (Tleh) carries the “ravenous wolf / divides the spoil” dynamic, often masked in the **ram**’s piety (shofar). Across the sky, **Dan** (Moznayim) is the **serpent on the path / the scales**—judgment and the perennial stumbling-block of idolatry you flag with resurrection doctrine. Supermoon = louder mic on that tension: predatory zeal cloaked in righteousness (wolf-as-ram) meeting serpentine legalism or doctrinal traps (the scales with fangs).

- **Historical undertow:** your Dan↔Benjamin thread (600 Danites preserving Benjamin; the Benjamite turn you associate with Paul) gets extra symbolic charge here. A bright Tleh can spotlight **Benjamite methods**—swift strikes, spoils, factional wins—while the opposing Moznayim pushes the **courtroom**: litigate, weigh, justify.

- **What that looks like “right now” (ways to call it live):**  
  1) **Unmaskings** — revelations where “pious” branding hides predatory practice; the ram’s horn as *alarm* rather than pageantry.  
  2) **Hard adjudication moments** — institutions doubling down on rules and verdicts (Dan), forcing a response from wolf-energy actors (Benjamin).  
  3) **Divide-the-spoil fights** — settlements, payouts, resource grabs framed as moral victories.

If you want a crisp lead-in on the mic: “Supermoon in **Tleh (Aries/Benjamin)**, Sun in **Moznayim (Libra/Dan)**—bright light on wolf-in-ram’s-clothing plays, and the scales are rattling.” Then we can walk listeners through how your Dan-as-stumbling-block vs. Benjamin-as-ravenous-actor storyline maps onto the week’s headlines.

(For our science-minded folks: biggest/closest full Moon of the year on Nov 5 in IAU **Aries**; expect perigean tides; sleep nudges are small; behavior myths are mostly myths. citeturn0search8turn2search16turn1search0turn4search11turn3search2)

Okay, cool, thanks. Um, not really doing a show at the moment, but gathering information. So, um... So shifting gears, we hear Jesus tell Peter, you have the keys to the kingdom and what you bind in heaven, what you bind on earth is bound in heaven. Now let's relate this to the solidifying of the official bounds of the constellations and how even Rome reflects a binding of the constellations in certain ways as fixed. So let's explore why the new or the official constellation boundaries are appropriate to use for this purpose given that Jesus says that these things are recognized in the heavens based on the way that we outline them whether our maps in other words are legitimized or recognized somehow

Love this line of thought. Here’s a tight, evidence-anchored way to link “keys/binding” to using **IAU** constellation boundaries in your Mazzaroth map (Tleh/Aries, Moznayim/Libra, ish ha-naḥash/Ophiuchus, etc.), rather than zodiac “signs.”

**1) “Bind/loose” = authorize/forbid (halakhic rulings).**  
In Second-Temple/Jewish usage, “bind” and “loose” are stock legal verbs: to prohibit or permit. That’s the force of Jesus’ “keys” language (Matt 16:19; 18:18): delegated authority to render decisions that the community then treats as operative. citeturn0search2turn2search15turn2search12

**2) The IAU literally “bound” the sky—globally.**  
Astronomers had overlapping/competing constellation outlines for centuries. The IAU fixed that: first GA in **Rome (1922)** adopted a standard list of **88** constellations (with **Latin** three-letter abbreviations), then commissioned Eugène **Delporte** to draw official borders—approved **1928 (Leiden)**, published **1930**. From that point, “X is in Aries” means “inside the agreed boundary,” not “part of a picture.” That’s institutional binding. citeturn3search0turn1search2

**3) Why those boundaries are uniquely fit for your purpose.**  
- **Objectivity & exclusivity:** Every point in the sky belongs to exactly one constellation—no overlaps, no ambiguity. That’s the whole reason Delporte drew them. citeturn1search4  
- **Reproducibility:** Borders follow lines of right ascension/declination on the **B1875** grid; precession skews their appearance on modern maps, but the polygons themselves are fixed—so anyone can compute “Moon in Tleh (Aries)” the same way, any year. citeturn4search2  
- **Continuity with tradition, clarified:** Delporte kept variables and legacy star assignments inside their long-used constellations—codifying, not erasing, the inherited sky lore. citeturn1search5

**4) It separates Mazzaroth constellations from horoscope “signs.”**  
IAU boundaries are about real sky areas; “signs” are 12 equal 30° slices anchored to the equinox (tropical) or a sidereal reference—different system. Using IAU areas lets you speak in the **thirteen** ecliptic constellations the Sun actually traverses, including **ish ha-naḥash (Ophiuchus)**—which astrology omits. citeturn0search8turn0search1

**5) The “Rome” imprint is literal.**  
The standard list and Latin names/abbreviations were set at the **Rome 1922** assembly; modern IAU lists still cite the Latin genitives you use for star designations (e.g., α Arietis in **Tleh/Aries**). That’s a historical “Roman” binding of names and edges. citeturn3search0turn3search2

**6) Analogy to calendar reform—binding time and sky.**  
Just as **Gregory XIII**’s reform “bound” civil time so feasts wouldn’t drift, the IAU “bound” sky regions so positions wouldn’t be arguable. Both are community-recognized standards that make shared work possible. citeturn0search7

**Bottom line**  
If your thesis is that faithful maps on earth are “recognized in the heavens,” then the IAU scheme is the cleanest way to operationalize it: a publicly authorized, once-for-all delimitation that lets you say, without ambiguity, “the Moon is in **Tleh (Aries/Benjamin)** opposite **Moznayim (Libra/Dan)**”—and everyone, scientist or skeptic, can verify it from the same borders. citeturn1search2
