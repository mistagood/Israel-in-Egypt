# Baptism with Holy Spirit

What does the Bible say about one coming who will baptize with the Holy Spirit and will fire?

The reference to one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire comes from the New Testament, particularly from John the Baptist's proclamation about the coming of Jesus. This is found in Matthew 3:11, where John says:

*"I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."*

John is contrasting his baptism with water for repentance with the transformative baptism that Jesus will bring. The baptism with the Holy Spirit refers to the inner transformation, renewal, and empowerment that comes from the Spirit of God. Fire, in this context, is often interpreted symbolically, representing purification, judgment, or the power of the Spirit that consumes and refines.

Luke 3:16 also contains a similar passage where John the Baptist speaks of the coming Messiah, who will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire, emphasizing the dual nature of Jesus' ministry—both in spiritual renewal and in the purging of those who do not repent.

This "baptism with fire" can also be seen as a refining process for believers, similar to how fire purifies gold, symbolizing trials, cleansing, or the removal of sin and impurities from a person's life.

What does Jesus say about a coming baptism or about baptism period?

Jesus speaks about baptism in several contexts, each reflecting different aspects of its meaning.

1. **Jesus' Own Baptism by John**  
   In Matthew 3:13-17, Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist, even though John initially resists, saying that Jesus should baptize him. Jesus insists, saying, *“Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness”* (Matthew 3:15). This event marks the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, and after His baptism, the heavens open, the Spirit of God descends like a dove, and a voice from heaven says, *“This is my Son, whom I love; with him, I am well pleased”* (Matthew 3:17). This emphasizes the significance of baptism as part of God's plan and approval of Jesus' mission.

2. **Baptism as a Symbol of Future Suffering**  
   In Luke 12:49-50, Jesus refers to a coming baptism, but not in the traditional sense of water baptism. He says:  
   *"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!"*  
   Here, Jesus is referring to His impending suffering and death on the cross as a "baptism." This use of "baptism" symbolizes a deep, overwhelming experience, in this case, the suffering and sacrifice He would endure. His reference to baptism in this context highlights the depth of His mission and the significance of His ultimate sacrifice.

3. **The Great Commission – Baptism and Discipleship**  
   After His resurrection, Jesus commands His disciples to baptize others. In Matthew 28:19, He says:  
   *“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”*  
   This passage, known as the Great Commission, emphasizes the role of baptism in the process of becoming a disciple of Christ. It signals a new relationship between believers and God, incorporating them into the community of faith, and the Trinitarian formula (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) reflects the fullness of God's presence in the act of baptism.

4. **Baptism as Salvation and New Birth**  
   In John 3:5, when Jesus speaks with Nicodemus, He says:  
   *"Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit."*  
   This is often understood as a reference to baptism, where water symbolizes repentance and the Spirit represents the inner transformation that accompanies true faith. Jesus is teaching that a spiritual rebirth—represented by baptism—is necessary to enter God's kingdom.

These passages reflect Jesus' view of baptism as a symbol of repentance, spiritual rebirth, and His own suffering. He uses baptism to describe His mission, His followers' transformation, and the process by which people enter into a new covenant with God.
