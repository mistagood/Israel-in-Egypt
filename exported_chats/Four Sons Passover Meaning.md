# Four Sons Passover Meaning

What's the story of the four suns at the Passover?

The story of the four suns at Passover comes from Jewish tradition and is often tied to the Passover Haggadah, the text recited during the Passover Seder. It’s not literally about "suns" as in celestial bodies, but rather "sons," representing different types of people and their approach to the Passover story. 

In the Passover Haggadah, there are four sons (or children), each symbolizing a different attitude toward the Passover and its significance:

1. **The Wise Son**: This son asks detailed questions about the laws and rituals of Passover. He is eager to learn and understand, and his questions reflect a deep respect for tradition. The wise son represents those who are engaged and knowledgeable about their faith.

2. **The Wicked Son**: This son distances himself from the community, asking, "What does this service mean to you?" The phrasing suggests he doesn’t see himself as part of the community or the tradition. The wicked son represents those who reject or are indifferent to their heritage.

3. **The Simple Son**: This son asks a straightforward question: "What is this?" His question is simple because his understanding is basic, but he is curious and open to learning. The simple son represents those who are less knowledgeable but willing to learn.

4. **The Son Who Does Not Know How to Ask**: This son doesn’t know what to ask. He’s either too young or too unaware to even know how to engage. The tradition says the parent should open the conversation with this son to guide him into understanding. He represents those who are disengaged but can be drawn into the conversation with proper guidance.

These "four sons" reflect different attitudes and levels of engagement with the story and rituals of Passover, symbolizing the diversity within the Jewish community and the importance of meeting each individual where they are in their journey of faith and tradition.
