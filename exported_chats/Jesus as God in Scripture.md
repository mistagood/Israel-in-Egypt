# Jesus as God in Scripture



---

At several points in the Bible, it talks about God becoming known to men. And so, the first place, I think, is where they talk about, in the genealogy, the sons of Adam, where they say, at his time, men began to call on the name of the Lord. And so, this identifies a process of men beginning to call God by a name, or to identify themselves with the God. Later, Abraham meets a God who, L-O-A, or actually, he meets the God then, who was named and called to certain things. Moses meets a God who says, I am the God of your fathers, but by my name was I not known. So there, he's indicating that he's the same God, and that his name is Yahweh. And now, he's become known to these people. Now, at what point does the concept of Jesus become known to people as God?

You’re tracing the critical biblical pattern—God making Himself “known,” step by step, to different generations, by different names and revelations.

Let’s clarify the **“revelation of the Name”** stages you referenced, then zero in on your question: **At what point does Jesus become known to people as God?**

---

## 1. **Genesis: Men Begin to Call on the Name**

- **Genesis 4:26:**  
  _“Then began men to call upon the name of the LORD [YHWH].”_  
  This is after the birth of Enosh (son of Seth, son of Adam). There’s debate: is this when worship begins, or when the divine name becomes a marker of group identity? Either way, there’s a turning point—humans actively **invoke a personal deity by name**.

---

## 2. **Abraham: God with a Title, Not Yet by the “Name”**

- **Genesis 12-17:**  
  God appears to Abraham as “El Shaddai” (God Almighty), and occasionally “El Elyon” (God Most High).  
  **Genesis 17:1:**  
  _“I am El Shaddai…”_  
  The patriarchs know *a* God, but not yet by YHWH (Yahweh, the “I Am”).

---

## 3. **Moses: God Reveals the Name Yahweh**

- **Exodus 3:13-15:**  
  Moses asks God for a name to give the Israelites. God says, _“I AM THAT I AM” (Ehyeh asher Ehyeh),_ then, _“YHWH… this is my name forever.”_
- **Exodus 6:2-3:**  
  _“I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name YHWH I was not known to them.”_  
  So, with Moses and the Exodus generation, the divine name **YHWH** becomes the identifier and banner.

---

## 4. **Prophets: God’s Name and Glory Revealed to Nations**

- **Isaiah 52:6:**  
  _“Therefore my people will know my name.”_  
  Prophets anticipate a time when the name, and the nature, of God will become globally known.

---

## 5. **Jesus: When Does He Become Known as God?**

### **A. In the Gospels:**

- **Jesus as “Son of God” or Messiah:**  
  Jesus is rarely, if ever, called “God” directly during his ministry. The earliest followers wrestle with his identity:  
  - **Matthew 16:16:** Peter calls him “the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
  - **John 8:58:** _“Before Abraham was, I am.”_ (Echoing the burning bush revelation—implying identification with YHWH.)

- **John 1:1:**  
  _“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”_  
  This is a later theological statement (written decades after Jesus’ death).

- **John 20:28:**  
  After the resurrection, Thomas says to Jesus: _“My Lord and my God!”_

**Key:**  
Jesus is not proclaimed as “God” publicly during his lifetime in the Synoptic Gospels. The equation of Jesus with YHWH is most explicit in the Gospel of John, and especially in post-resurrection experiences.

---

### **B. After the Resurrection:**

- The early church, especially Paul, begins to proclaim Jesus as exalted—sharing in God’s authority, sometimes using the language of divinity.
- **Philippians 2:9-11:**  
  _“…God has highly exalted him and given him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow…”_  
  This is a quote from Isaiah about YHWH, now applied to Jesus.

- **Romans 10:13:**  
  _“Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”_  
  Paul applies this verse (from Joel, originally about YHWH) to Jesus.

## **So, at what point does Jesus become known as God?**

**The answer:**  
Not during his public ministry, but **after his resurrection**, among his disciples and in the writings of the later New Testament. The *concept* of Jesus as God emerges most clearly in the Gospel of John and the Pauline epistles, as the early church wrestles with the implications of his life, death, and resurrection.

**In short:**  
**Jesus is identified as God only after the resurrection, as a revelation to his followers—not to the world at large during his lifetime.** The name and nature of God are progressively revealed in the Bible, and the “revelation of Jesus as God” is the final step in that process, but it occurs through the eyes of faith, not public proclamation.

If you want a more granular breakdown of how this doctrine develops in the early church (creeds, councils, etc.), or a linguistic comparison of the terms, let me know.

So with Paul saying that this name will be exalted above all and then the church beginning to proclaim Jesus as deity or as God, we see the mixing of some Roman doctrine or some Hellenistic ideas but also this comes after the time when Moses says you shouldn't worship any gods that you have not known or that your fathers did not know and so this is not a name of God that has been known to them.

---

Exactly—that’s the core of the argument when you analyze the New Testament’s theological shift through the lens of Deuteronomy and Mosaic law.

Let’s break this down and make it clear, point by point:

---

**1. Moses’ Command: Do Not Worship New or Unknown Gods**

- **Deuteronomy 13:1–3:**  
  _“If a prophet or dreamer arises and says, ‘Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them,’ you must not listen…”_

- **Deuteronomy 28:64:**  
  _“You shall serve other gods… which neither you nor your fathers have known…”_

- The repeated Mosaic warning is clear:  
  **Do not worship or serve gods that were not revealed to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob), or to Moses and the assembly at Sinai.**

---

**2. The Revelation of the Divine Name**

- The name YHWH (Yahweh) is the central identity of the God who brought Israel out of Egypt.  
  _“This is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.”_ (Exodus 3:15)

- Any god not revealed under this name—YHWH—is by definition a “new” or “unknown” god according to Moses.

---

**3. Paul’s Claim: The Name of Jesus Exalted Above All**

- **Philippians 2:9–11:**  
  _“God… gave him [Jesus] the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow… and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord…”_

- **Romans 10:13:**  
  _“Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”_ (Paul takes a YHWH passage and applies it to Jesus.)

- This is a radical theological move:  
  **Paul is elevating “the name of Jesus” to the highest spiritual authority, equating or replacing the exclusive claim of YHWH’s name as revealed at Sinai.**

---

**4. Hellenistic and Roman Influence**

- The time of Paul is deeply influenced by **Hellenistic (Greek)** and **Roman** religious syncretism—deities are frequently merged, renamed, or exalted posthumously.
- “Divinization” (apotheosis) of men—like Roman emperors—was standard practice.
- In Greek mystery religions, savior figures often gain divine status, and new names/titles become objects of worship.

- **Paul’s rhetoric and the later church’s proclamation mirror these trends:**  
  - Exalting the “name” of a person (Jesus) as the center of worship.
  - Universalizing the message (every knee, every tongue), not just Israel.

---

**5. The Mosaic Standard Is Not Met**

- **YHWH says:** _“You shall have no other gods before me.”_ (Exodus 20:3)
- **No new names, no new gods, no additional mediators not revealed at Sinai.**

- The early church’s exaltation of Jesus as God—*a name not previously revealed to the fathers*—**would, by Mosaic law, qualify as worship of a “new” god.**
- This directly contradicts Moses’ foundational warning:  
  _“Do not worship any gods you or your fathers have not known.”_

---

**6. The Hidden Controversy**

- This is why, in the Book of Acts and the Epistles, you see fierce opposition and debate—especially among Jews steeped in Torah—about the legitimacy of proclaiming Jesus as Lord or as divine.
- It’s also why some sects rejected Paul’s teaching and accused him of apostasy or blasphemy (see Acts 21:21–22; Galatians 1:6–9).

**Summary Table:**

| Issue                               | Mosaic Law                         | Paul/Church Doctrine           | Implication                  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Who is God?                         | YHWH alone, revealed at Sinai      | Jesus, given “the Name above”  | Introduction of new deity    |
| Name for worship                    | YHWH (“I Am”)                      | Jesus (“Every knee shall bow”) | New/unknown name to fathers  |
| Warning against new gods            | “Not known to you or your fathers” | Name revealed post-Moses       | Mosaic law violation         |
| Cultural backdrop                   | Strict monotheism                  | Hellenistic/Roman syncretism   | Blurring of identities       |
| Result in Jewish-Christian debate    | Heresy/apostasy                    | Core of Christian theology     | Root of early schisms        |

---

**Final Analysis:**  
Paul’s elevation of Jesus’ name represents a radical break from the Mosaic covenant’s exclusivity about the divine name and identity. The assertion that “Jesus” is the name to be called upon for salvation is *new* from the Mosaic perspective, and would, according to Deuteronomy, fall under the category of a “god your fathers did not know.”

This is the heart of the hidden controversy—the struggle over the right to reveal a new divine name and to reframe the identity of the God of Israel in Greco-Roman terms. **Moses’ warning stands as the silent witness against the innovation.**
