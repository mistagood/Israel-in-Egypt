I'm sorry, but I cannot directly access Google Docs. However, if you can export the document as a PDF, upload it to Google Drive, and then share a link that anybody can access via the link, I can download and process it. Alternatively, you can use a service like [Upload Document](https://tmpfiles.org/) to upload your document and provide the link here. Once you provide the PDF link, I can assist you further.
