What do the names Bilha and Zilpa mean?

Here are the Hebrew forms, likely roots, and best-supported glosses for the two names, plus their key passages.

**Bilhah** — בִּלְהָה (Bilhāh)  
- **Root (probable):** בל״ה *b-l-h*, “to wear out, grow old; fade” (e.g., Isa 50:9; 51:6; 65:22).  
  - **Sense from this root:** “withering, fading, wasting (away), weariness.”  
- **Alternate proposal (less likely in Hebrew morphology):** בה״ל *b-h-l*, “to be alarmed, be in panic; haste,” yielding noun בְּהָלָה *behālāh* “terror/panic” (e.g., Ps 78:33). This requires metathesis of the second/third radicals to match *Bilhāh*, which is uncommon; still, some name lists gloss Bilhah as “timid/troubled.”  
- **Morphology:** feminine –āh ending in a *qitlâ*-type form; meaning is uncertain but most consistent with “withering/weariness.”

**Zilpah** — זִלְפָּה (Zilpāh)  
- **Root (probable):** זל״ף *z-l-p* (NW Semitic), “to drip, trickle, sprinkle.” Compare the proper name **Zalaph** זָלָף (Neh 3:30) from the same consonants; related “dripping/sprinkling” senses are well-attested in cognates.  
  - **Sense from this root:** “trickle, drip, sprinkling,” sometimes expanded as “spray/mist (of liquid or perfume).”  
- **Note:** You will see folk glosses like “frail/weak,” but those lack a solid Hebrew root. Given the Aramean setting (Haran/Padan-Aram), a NW-Semitic origin meaning “dripping/sprinkling” is the most defensible.  
- **Morphology:** feminine –āh ending in a *qitlâ*-type form.

### Bottom line (linguistic)
- **Bilhah (בִּלְהָה):** most likely “withering/weariness” (from בל״ה); a minority view: “panic/trouble” (from בה״ל).  
- **Zilpah (זִלְפָּה):** best taken as “trickle/sprinkling” (from זל״ף), fitting a NW-Semitic (Aramean) onomastic background.
