# Slavery Abolition Timeline Comparison



---

When was slavery outlawed in the U.S. versus other places that were heavily involved in the slave trade such as England, etc.?

---

Are you looking for a general timeline comparison of when slavery was abolished in different countries, or do you want details on the legal and social processes that led to abolition in each place? Also, would you like information on how these bans were enforced and their impact?

---

Yes, I'd like a general timeline first, but I'm working on a theory that may explain America's late abolition.

---

I'll compile a general timeline comparing when slavery was outlawed in the U.S. versus other major nations involved in the transatlantic slave trade, such as England, France, Spain, and Portugal. This will help provide historical context for your theory on why abolition occurred later in the U.S.

I'll let you know when I have the full details ready.

# Abolition of Slavery: U.S. and Other Major Slave-Trading Nations

**Overview:** The transatlantic slave trade powers abolished slavery at different times in the 19th century. Below is a timeline by country (United States, Great Britain/England, France, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil) with key abolition dates, laws, movements, and notes on enforcement delays. We also highlight how and why each nation’s path to abolition differed.

## United States

- **1808 (Import Ban):** The U.S. Congress outlawed the *importation* of enslaved people, effective January 1, 1808【25†L262-L268】. This fulfilled a constitutional clause allowing a ban on the international slave trade after 20 years, but domestic slavery continued.  
- **Abolition Movement:** From the late 18th century through the 19th, Northern states abolished slavery (1777–1804 gradually in the North) and abolitionist activists (such as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and others) campaigned against slavery. Enslaved people themselves resisted through escapes (e.g. via the Underground Railroad) and rebellions.  
- **1861–1865 (Civil War):** The division between free and slave states led to the American Civil War. President Lincoln’s *Emancipation Proclamation* (Jan. 1, 1863) declared slaves in Confederate states “forever free,” but it applied only in rebel-held areas and not Union border states【57†L51-L58】. Full emancipation required Union military victory to enforce it.  
- **1865 (13th Amendment):** In the aftermath of Civil War, the U.S. formally abolished slavery nationwide. Congress passed the 13th Amendment in January 1865 and it was ratified on December 6, 1865, *outlawing slavery in every state*【57†L48-L55】. This law freed about 4 million people. Unlike some other nations, the U.S. did **not** compensate slaveholders, and abolition came via a bloody war rather than gradual legislative reform. Enforcement was immediate in Union-controlled areas, though remote regions saw delays (news of freedom reached the last enslaved Texans in June 1865, celebrated as “Juneteenth”). The abolition in the U.S. was driven by a mix of moral abolitionist pressure and the strategic goals of preserving the Union, culminating in a war that forcibly ended the institution.

## Great Britain (England)

- **1807 (Slave Trade Act):** Britain (the United Kingdom) abolished the *transatlantic slave trade* in 1807【25†L258-L264】. The law made it illegal for British ships to transport enslaved people, and the Royal Navy began enforcing the ban worldwide (including pressing other nations like Spain and Portugal to cease slave trading【25†L274-L282】). However, slavery itself remained legal in British colonies for a few more decades.  
- **Abolition Movement:** A strong abolitionist movement in Britain, led by figures like William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, and Olaudah Equiano, had raised public awareness. Humanitarian, religious, and Enlightenment ideals – along with changing economic interests – fueled British anti-slavery activism. Courts had already signaled opposition (the 1772 Somerset case effectively ended slavery on English soil, though not in colonies).  
- **1833 (Slavery Abolition Act):** Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, which **abolished slavery in most of the British Empire** (effective 1834)【25†L281-L288】. This emancipated about 800,000 enslaved people in the Caribbean, South Africa, Canada and other British colonies【25†L281-L288】. To ease the transition and address planters’ concerns, Britain instituted an *apprenticeship* system – freed people over age six had to continue working for former owners for a fixed period (up to 6 years) as “apprentices”【70†L73-L80】. This was meant to delay full freedom, but due to humanitarian outcry the apprenticeship was terminated early in 1838, after which full emancipation took effect. Importantly, the British government **compensated slaveowners** generously (paying £20 million, a huge sum then, as reimbursement for lost “property”) – but freed slaves received nothing.  
- **Enforcement and Impact:** Abolition in the British Empire occurred without civil war, largely through legislation driven by public opinion and moral reform. The Royal Navy aggressively suppressed illegal slaving after 1807, signing treaties and even boarding foreign ships to free captives【11†L119-L127】【11†L129-L137】. Britain’s abolition set an example that pressured other nations and reflected the empire’s shifting economy (industrialization made slavery less central than it was for plantation colonies). 

## France

- **1794 (First Abolition):** Amid the French Revolution, the National Convention abolished slavery in all French colonies on February 4, 1794【38†L321-L328】. This made France the **first major slave-trading empire to outlaw slavery** across its empire【34†L70-L78】. Revolutionary ideals of *liberté, égalité, fraternité* and the influence of a massive slave uprising in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) drove this decree【34†L70-L78】. However, this early abolition was not fully implemented in some colonies (and some areas were under British occupation or in rebellion).  
- **1802 (Napoleonic Reversal):** Napoleon Bonaparte, as First Consul, **reinstated slavery** in the French colonies by decree in 1802, overturning the 1794 law【34†L75-L78】【38†L324-L328】. Under pressure from plantation owners (especially for sugar islands like Martinique and Guadeloupe) and seeking to regain control, France restored slavery, becoming the only country to re-legalize slavery after abolishing it. This betrayal of revolutionary principles helped trigger Haiti’s final push for independence in 1804【34†L75-L79】. Slavery then continued in French colonies for another four decades【34†L79-L84】.  
- **1848 (Final Abolition):** In 1848, during a wave of revolution in Europe, France’s Second Republic permanently abolished slavery. On April 27, 1848, under the leadership of abolitionist Victor *Schoelcher*, the provisional government issued a decree for the **general and unconditional emancipation** of slaves in all French colonies【34†L93-L96】【38†L324-L328】. Approximately 250,000 enslaved people in French overseas territories (such as the Caribbean and Réunion) were freed. Unlike Britain, France did *not* compensate slaveholders in 1848 – the decree was immediate and uncompromising (reflecting the view of slavery as a crime against human rights).  
- **Motivations and Enforcement:** French abolition was deeply tied to political revolution and republican ideals. The 1794 abolition was driven by Enlightenment thought and the urgent reality of slave revolts; its reversal showed the pull of colonial economic interests. The final 1848 abolition was influenced by both metropolitan activists and protests by free blacks and mulattoes in the colonies. Once decreed in 1848, emancipation was enforced by officials and met with minimal violent resistance, partly because the decision coincided with a strong anti-slavery consensus in Paris. France’s path shows the tension between lofty ideals and economic interests – and how enslaved people’s own insurgency (as in Haiti) forced the issue.

## Spain

- **1811–1812 (Early Decree):** In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, delegates in Spain’s Cortes of Cádiz (the wartime parliament) declared *slavery abolished in Spain and Spanish domains* in 1811. **However, they exempted Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo** (the remaining major Caribbean colonies) from immediate emancipation【22†L7-L15】. This early abolition decree had little practical effect: Spain’s beleaguered government had limited control, and Cuban and Puerto Rican authorities flatly ignored it【22†L7-L15】. Thus, while Spain **on paper** began abolishing slavery early, in practice its richest colonies continued the institution.  
- **1817 (Slave Trade Ban Treaty):** Spain signed a treaty with Britain in 1817 agreeing to end the African slave trade, effective in 1820【25†L275-L282】. In return, Spain received a monetary inducement from Britain. *Enforcement was weak*, and Cuban planters continued to import enslaved Africans illegally for decades, with tacit Spanish support. (Cuba and Brazil became the largest slave importers after 1820, often via smugglers evading British patrols.) Only in the 1860s was the transatlantic trade to Cuba fully suppressed【50†L19-L23】.  
- **Gradual Reforms:** As anti-slavery sentiment grew and Spain lost most of its mainland American colonies (which themselves abolished slavery upon independence in the 1820s), the Spanish government hesitated to free slaves in its last colonies. Fearing a repeat of Haiti’s slave revolt and wanting to protect the booming sugar economy of Cuba, Spain chose **gradual measures**: The *Moret Law* of 1870 (also called “free womb” law) declared children born to enslaved mothers in Cuba and Puerto Rico to be free (though they owed service to the mother’s master until age 18) – a partial step toward abolition. Enslaved people over age 60 were also freed under this law.  
- **1873 (Puerto Rico Abolition):** On March 22, 1873, Spain’s National Assembly (during a brief republican period) **abolished slavery in Puerto Rico**, freeing approximately 29,000 slaves【47†L1-L4】. Owners were compensated 35 million pesetas, and freedpeople had to **serve a three-year “apprenticeship”** on their former masters’ plantations as transition【47†L1-L4】. This meant full freedom in Puerto Rico came in 1876.  
- **1886 (Cuba Abolition):** Slavery persisted longest in Cuba, which was one of the world’s last strongholds of chattel slavery. After prolonged resistance from slaveholders, Spain **abolished slavery in Cuba by royal decree on October 7, 1886**, freeing about 300,000 people. This came after decades of international pressure and internal unrest. Cuba had already stopped legally importing slaves by the 1860s under pressure, but the institution remained vital to its sugar industry【63†L411-L415】. By 1886, economic shifts (e.g. industrial sugar processing, use of indentured Chinese labor) and a growing abolitionist movement made continuation untenable. Spain did compensate many Cuban slave owners and did so *without* an apprenticeship system – freedom was immediate in 1886.  
- **Context:** Spain’s abolition process was *protracted and pragmatic*. Unlike the moral crusades in Britain or France, Spanish debates were heavily economic. Cuba’s plantation owners were powerful; slavery was only ended when it was clear that maintaining it risked more rebellion (Cuba had seen a major anticolonial war, the Ten Years’ War 1868–78, where the question of emancipation was central). In essence, Spain was among the **last** to outlaw slavery in the Americas, doing so only when forced by circumstance. 

## Portugal

- **1761 (Metropolitan Portugal):** Portugal was actually an early adopter of limited abolition – the Marquis of Pombal, a powerful reformer, **decreed in 1761 the abolition of slavery in mainland Portugal and Portuguese India**【55†L158-L164】. This meant no person could be enslaved on Portugal’s European soil (a law similar to Spain’s early ban of slavery at home). However, this did *not* apply to Portugal’s colonies in Africa, Brazil, and elsewhere, where slavery continued unabated.  
- **Early 19th Century:** Portugal, under British diplomatic pressure (as Britain sought a global end to the slave trade), made agreements to restrict the trade. In 1815 and 1817, Portugal agreed to limit slave trading north of the equator. Yet Portuguese traders continued sending slaves to Brazil (which was then a Portuguese territory) until Brazil’s independence in 1822. Even after that, Portuguese ships (often under Brazilian flag) were active in the illicit trade.  
- **1836 (Trade Abolished):** Portugal formally **outlawed the transatlantic slave trade in 1836**【64†L158-L164】, under the influence of progressive Portuguese officials like the Marquis of Sá da Bandeira. This came after Brazil (Portugal’s former colony) had declared independence; thus, Portugal’s ongoing role in the slave trade mostly involved its African colonies and illicit traffic. British anti-slavery patrols and treaties finally curtailed Portuguese slave trading by the 1840s.  
- **1850s–1860s (Gradual Colonial Abolition):** In the mid-19th century, Portugal slowly moved to end slavery in its remaining colonies (such as Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Goa). A series of laws between 1854 and 1869 incrementally freed certain classes of slaves and regulated emancipation.  
- **1869 (Complete Abolition in Colonies):** In February 1869, the Portuguese government passed a law *abolishing slavery in all Portuguese overseas territories*【64†L158-L164】. This marked the final end of legal slavery under Portuguese rule (coming into effect the next year, 1870). Notably, by this time, the number of enslaved people in Portuguese Africa had dwindled, partly replaced by systems of forced labor (indentured servitude, contract labor, etc., which unfortunately continued in various forms).  
- **Motivations:** Portugal’s path to abolition was influenced by external pressure more than domestic moral movement. British diplomatic and naval pressure was crucial in ending the trade【11†L119-L127】【14†L160-L167】, and the loss of Brazil (which had been the largest slave colony) reduced the economic incentive to keep slavery. Portuguese intellectuals and officials gradually accepted abolition as part of modernization. By 1869, with other powers having ended slavery and with slavery less profitable, Portugal could abolish it with little turmoil. Unlike Britain or France, Portugal had no large-scale slave revolts or civil war forcing the issue, and it enacted abolition by legislation and decree. 

## Brazil

- **1822 (Independent Brazil inherits slavery):** Brazil, formerly the biggest colony of Portugal, gained independence in 1822 and **retained slavery** as an empire. In fact, Brazil became the largest slave-holding nation in the Western Hemisphere in the 19th century, with an economy dependent on coffee, sugar, and rubber produced by enslaved labor.  
- **1850 (End of Slave Trade – “Eusébio de Queirós Law”):** Under intense pressure from Britain (including the threat of naval action under Britain’s anti-slave trade patrols), Brazil outlawed the Atlantic slave trade in 1850【64†L164-L166】. This law (often called the Eusébio de Queirós Law) came after years of Britain intercepting slave ships bound for Brazil. While it **officially ended Brazil’s participation in the trade**, illegal smuggling continued on a smaller scale for a few years【25†L311-L316】. By the mid-1850s, the flow of new enslaved Africans into Brazil had effectively stopped, shifting the focus to the enslaved population already in Brazil.  
- **Abolition Movement:** In the late 19th century, Brazil developed a homegrown abolitionist movement – including educated elites, journalists (like Joaquim Nabuco), and free black activists – who campaigned to end slavery. Enslaved people themselves increased resistance: mass flight (quilombos or maroon communities grew), strikes on plantations, and some localized revolts. This created a climate that slavery was becoming untenable.  
- **1871 (Law of the Free Womb):** The Brazilian Parliament passed the “Free Womb Law” (Lei do Ventre Livre) in 1871, **granting freedom to all children born to enslaved mothers** after that date【69†L1-L4】. This meant slavery would die out gradually over generations. However, the law had compromises: those children owed service to the mother’s master until age 21 to compensate the owners【69†L1-L4】. So freedom was delayed to adulthood, and the law did not free anyone already enslaved. Still, it was a critical first step, signaling a shift in policy.  
- **1885 (Sexagenarian Law):** Another partial measure, the Law of the Sexagenarians (Lei dos Sexagenários) in 1885, **freed enslaved people who were over 60 years old**. In practice this affected relatively few (since enslaved people often did not survive to old age, or owners would work around it), but it was another sign of the waning institution.  
- **1888 (Golden Law – Total Abolition):** Finally, on May 13, 1888, Princess Isabel (acting as regent for Emperor Pedro II) signed the *Lei Áurea*, or “Golden Law,” **abolishing slavery completely in Brazil**【68†L1-L5】. This law was stunningly short – just one article with 18 words – but it liberated the remaining enslaved population (about 700,000 people) immediately, **with no compensation to slaveowners**【68†L1-L5】【68†L7-L9】. Brazil was the **last country in the Americas** to abolish slavery, and it did so essentially overnight. The news was met with widespread celebrations among freedpeople and abolitionists. Former owners, however, were furious at losing their human property without payment, which contributed to a decline in support for the monarchy. (Indeed, the Brazilian monarchy was overthrown in 1889, the year after abolition, in part due to elite discontent.)  
- **Aftermath and Reasons:** Brazil’s abolition came via a combination of **gradual legal steps and mounting social pressure**. Unlike the U.S., it was a largely *peaceful* process (no large civil war was fought over slavery in Brazil), but it was *protracted* and required years of advocacy and economic change. By the 1880s, many planters had already shifted to using European immigrant labor on coffee plantations, lessening resistance to abolition. Humanitarian ideals, pressure from Britain and other nations, and the visible success of free labor economies elsewhere all played a role. When abolition finally happened, Brazil provided no support or land to the freedpeople, leaving many to rural poverty – a legacy still felt today. But the immediate, uncompensated emancipation in 1888 stands in contrast to the compensated, gradual approaches of other nations.

## Comparative Highlights

- **Timeline:** Among these major slave-trading powers, **Britain and France** took the lead in the first half of the 19th century (Britain ending slavery by 1838【25†L281-L288】, France by 1848【38†L324-L328】). The **United States** was middling, abolishing slavery in 1865【57†L48-L55】 after a civil war. **Spain and Brazil** were laggards – Spain maintained slavery in Cuba until 1886【63†L411-L415】, and Brazil was last in 1888【64†L164-L166】. Portugal’s case is mixed: it stopped *its own* slavery relatively early (1761 in Portugal【64†L158-L164】) but kept it in colonies until 1869【64†L158-L164】, influenced by Britain and the loss of Brazil. 
- **Methods of Abolition:** Britain and France abolished slavery via **government action in peacetime**, driven by moral movements (e.g. British abolitionism, French revolutionary ideals). Britain legislated gradual emancipation with compensation【25†L281-L288】, whereas France’s final abolition was immediate and uncompensated, tied to a revolutionary upheaval【38†L324-L328】. The U.S. abolition was achieved through **war** – a violent rupture that led to a constitutional amendment【57†L48-L55】. Spain and Brazil used **gradual laws** to phase out slavery (free womb laws, staged emancipation) before the final decrees in the 1880s; their abolitions were relatively peaceful but very delayed, driven by economic pragmatism and outside pressure rather than just moral urgency. 
- **Enforcement Delays:** In several cases, legal abolition didn’t instantly translate to freedom on the ground. For example, Britain’s use of apprenticeships delayed full liberty until 1838. Spain’s 1873 Puerto Rico law required three more years of labor from freed slaves【47†L1-L4】. In the U.S., pockets of enslaved people weren’t informed of their freedom until months after the 13th Amendment (hence Juneteenth 1865). In Brazil, children born free still had to serve masters until adulthood under the 1871 law【69†L1-L4】. And despite treaties, the **illegal slave trade** persisted: Spain’s subjects smuggled slaves into Cuba until the 1860s【50†L19-L23】, and slave imports into Brazil continued clandestinely into the early 1850s【25†L311-L316】. Enforcement often required international monitoring (British naval patrols) or internal political will that was slow to build. 
- **Motivations:** The *why* of abolition varied. **Humanitarian and philosophical arguments** (the recognition of slavery as a moral evil and violation of rights) were crucial in Britain and France, and among American abolitionists, often rooted in religious conviction (Quakers, Evangelicals) or revolutionary principles. **Economic factors** also played a role: industrializing economies found wage labor more efficient; some colonies saw profits decline or planters diversify to new labor sources. Britain, for instance, after 1800 had less economic need for slavery and could afford to renounce it (even paying compensation). In the U.S. and Brazilian cases, slavery remained profitable up to the end, so moral and political conflicts (rather than lack of profit) ended slavery. **Political and security concerns** were decisive too: fear of slave revolts (Haiti’s example loomed large), desire to appease international allies or avoid isolation (as in Brazil by the 1880s), and in the U.S., the need to preserve the Union and win a war. Each nation balanced these factors differently, leading to different paces and styles of abolition.
