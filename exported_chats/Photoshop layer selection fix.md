# Photoshop layer selection fix



---

Guru mode.  How do I change the settings in Photoshop so that I can select the layer without it dissecting the layer every time I try to click something so I wanted to stay on a layer instead of selecting a layer with the mouse with the click light, I don’t wanna click on the image select it. I wanna just have a layer selected in the layers and stay on that

Got it — here’s the fix, step-by-step:  

1. **Select the Move Tool** (shortcut: **V**).  
2. Look at the **top options bar** — there’s a checkbox labeled **“Auto-Select.”**  
3. **Uncheck “Auto-Select.”**  
   - When it’s checked, Photoshop automatically selects whichever layer you click on in the canvas.  
   - When it’s unchecked, you stay locked on whatever layer is highlighted in the **Layers panel.**  
4. You can still manually switch layers by clicking their names in the Layers panel.  

**Pro tip:**  
If you ever need to temporarily toggle *Auto-Select* back on without changing the setting, hold **Ctrl (Windows) / Command (Mac)** while clicking on the canvas.  

After this, your cursor won’t “dissect” layers when you click around — it’ll stay fixed on the currently selected one.

Okay, cool. Is there a way that I can get it to, um, take that bounding box off?

Yep — you can turn that off too. That bounding box is called **“Show Transform Controls.”**  

Here’s how to remove it:  

1. Make sure you’ve got the **Move Tool (V)** selected.  
2. Up in the **top options bar**, look for a checkbox labeled **“Show Transform Controls.”**  
3. **Uncheck** it.  

That’ll hide the bounding box outline around the selected layer.  

**Bonus tip:**  
If you ever want to bring it back just temporarily (say, for quick resizing), you can press **Ctrl + T / Cmd + T** to enter **Free Transform** mode — the box will show up until you hit **Enter/Return** to confirm or **Esc** to cancel.  

Once unchecked, the Move Tool will feel much cleaner — no accidental handles or outlines.
