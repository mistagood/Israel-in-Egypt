# Levirate law and parallels



---



---

Naomi first mentions, or references, the levirate Law, when she asks her daughter-in-law if they're not waiting for her daughter-in-law. At this point, she's referencing the story of Judah and his two sons who died, and waiting for Shela, the third son of Judah. Here we see an answer to the enigmatic insertion of the chapter about Judah in the middle of the story of Joseph going down to Egypt. Out of nowhere, I believe, chapter 39 suggests that Judah goes away and has all these transactions. Now, this reminds us of the story of Naomi and Elimelech, who also went away and had two sons during a time of a famine. And so we see some parallels there, as well as the two sons dying. And so this all is teaching us that this is connected with a very important theme that we have to pay attention to. Naomi next mentions the next of kin when Ruth tells her about her meeting of Boaz. She tells her to stay close and instructs her in how to go about the next steps. Roof uncovers Boaz's feet, and he gives her shelter under his garden and covers his feet and her leg there. The next day, the kinsman has his shoe removed for shame because now his feet must remain uncovered because he doesn't do the next of kin duty. We'll bring this all together as we continue this thread.

Both narratives revolve around death, famine, and the question of family continuity. Naomi’s references to waiting, kinship, and redemption frame Ruth’s actions as the fulfillment of what was left undone in Judah’s household. Boaz’s acceptance of the duty restores the broken chain, connecting Joseph’s descent into Egypt with Israel’s eventual redemption through the lineage that leads to David.",

      "The levirate law underscores God’s design for preserving family lines through kinship duty.",

      "Ruth’s story redeems and corrects the earlier narrative of Judah and Tamar."

In Chapter 4, Boaz explicitly states that the person must raise up the seed for the dead man, and the next of kin specifically says that he cannot do it because it would jeopardize his home. And so, we see very explicit reasoning for why this man also did not do the kid's mother's right. He is the equivalent of Shelah. And so, we know that this is all considered to be folly, or misfortune, or wickedness in some way. As Judah says, that Tamar was more righteous than he was. So, Ruth then represents a type of Tamar. And her child then, this is brought back by the ladies who say that may this child be born, may Ruth be like Rachel and Leah, combining the two houses of Jacob. And this is why they make such a big ado about the child, because he is that child, and he combines the houses because he is the redeemer, and nobody wants to do it. But they also explicitly mention Perez, and say that it will be like Perez, like a breach. And so, this child will also take the kingdom to a breach. And so, we see that this is actually two houses and a breach coming because the kingdom was rightfully supposed to be under the heirs of the dead man, but we see that it went to the heirs of Boaz instead. And so, the dead man is forgotten, and not raised up. And so, this is the breach, the taking of the kingdom that is mentioned by Perez. Much of the hidden meaning is exposed when we look at this line for line
