# Comparing Allah and Elohim



---



---

Please compare the root words for the Arabic and Hebrew Allah and Elohim. I want to know what the original spellings are and compare how closely these words resemble each other.

---



---

In Arabic, the term for God is **"Allah" (الله)**. The root of "Allah" is derived from the Arabic definite article "al-" (the) combined with "ilah," which means "god" or "deity." So, "Allah" essentially means "The God."

In Hebrew, the term for God is **"Elohim" (אֱלֹהִים)**. The root of "Elohim" comes from "El" (אֵל), which means "god" or "mighty one." The suffix "-him" is a plural form used in Hebrew but often interpreted in a singular sense when referring to the one true God in the context of Jewish theology.

When comparing these terms:
- "Allah" is composed of the Arabic article and the term for deity, whereas "Elohim" is a plural form derived from "El."
- "Allah" does not closely resemble "Elohim" in form or pronunciation, though both refer to the concept of a supreme deity in their respective traditions.

Despite these differences, both terms reflect deep religious significance within Islam and Judaism, signifying the central role of a singular divine entity in their faiths.

Ilah and Eloh resemble one another. I’m looking for the root connection of these words. It seems that they both arrived from LH.

---

The similarity you observe between "Ilah" (الله) in Arabic and "Elohim" (אֱלֹהִים) in Hebrew, especially with the potential connection to the root "LH," is intriguing. 

Here's a closer look at their roots:

- **Ilah (إله)**: In Arabic, "Ilah" means "god" or "deity" and is the root for "Allah." The root for "Ilah" is generally considered to be *ʔ-l-h*, which is associated with the concept of divinity.

- **Elohim (אֱלֹהִים)**: In Hebrew, "Elohim" is derived from the root *ʔ-l-h* as well. The root *ʔ-l-h* (אל) also means "god" or "mighty one," and is used in the plural form to emphasize majesty or plurality in the Hebrew context.

Both "Ilah" and "Elohim" share a common root *ʔ-l-h* (which may be represented as "LH" in some transliterations), reflecting a shared Semitic heritage where the concept of deity or divinity is central. This common root suggests that both terms likely evolved from an ancient linguistic and cultural background that recognized a central concept of god or divinity. The resemblance in their roots highlights the historical and linguistic connections between Semitic languages and their shared religious concepts.

---

But it seems then that these are both referring to the same God of whom Jesus was a messenger.

---

The connection between "Ilah" (Allah) and "Elohim" through their shared root *ʔ-l-h* indicates a common Semitic linguistic and cultural heritage, suggesting that they both refer to the concept of a supreme deity. In this broader context:

- **In Islam**: "Allah" is understood as the one true God, encompassing all aspects of divinity and supreme authority.

- **In Judaism**: "Elohim" refers to God, often emphasizing attributes of power and majesty, and is used in the context of the covenantal relationship with Israel.

- **In Christianity**: Jesus is seen as a messenger and the Son of God, representing the same divine authority that is also reflected in the Hebrew and Arabic terms. Christianity builds upon the Jewish concept of God, with Jesus' teachings and life interpreted as fulfilling and expanding upon the Jewish understanding of God.

While "Allah" and "Elohim" are used within different religious frameworks, they are rooted in the same ancient Semitic traditions and share a common understanding of a singular, all-powerful deity. This shared root highlights a significant theological continuity across these Abrahamic faiths.

Please explain these characters and their meaning ʔ-l-h

---

The characters *ʔ-l-h* represent the root used in Semitic languages to denote concepts related to divinity and deity. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **ʔ (Aleph)**: This character is often used in Semitic languages as a glottal stop or a placeholder for a vowel. It does not carry specific meaning on its own but serves as a crucial component in forming roots and words.

2. **l (Lamed)**: In both Arabic and Hebrew, this letter typically means "to" or "for" when used as a preposition. As part of a root, it is often associated with concepts of guidance or direction.

3. **h (He)**: This letter can function as a definite article or a component of a root. In the context of divine names, it contributes to the root's meaning of divinity or deity.

In both Arabic and Hebrew:
- **Arabic**: The root *ʔ-l-h* (إله) forms the word "Ilah," meaning "god" or "deity." When combined with the definite article "al-" to form "Allah" (الله), it means "The God."

- **Hebrew**: The root *ʔ-l-h* (אֵל) forms the word "El," meaning "god" or "mighty one," and "Elohim" (אֱלֹהִים) is a plural form used to denote a supreme being with majesty and power.

The similarity in these roots reflects their shared Semitic linguistic ancestry, where the roots typically convey the concept of a supreme, powerful deity.

---

Are these speaking of the same God?

---

The roots *ʔ-l-h* in Arabic and Hebrew both refer to the concept of a supreme deity, and while they are used to denote the one God in their respective religious contexts, whether they refer to the "same" God can depend on theological perspectives:

1. **In Islam**: "Allah" (الله) refers to the singular, all-powerful, and all-knowing God. Islam emphasizes the absolute oneness of God and does not ascribe any partners or divisions to His nature.

2. **In Judaism**: "Elohim" (אֱלֹהִים) is one of the names for God, representing His power, majesty, and the covenant relationship with Israel. In Judaism, God is understood as a singular, unique entity, but the concept of God includes various aspects and attributes.

3. **In Christianity**: The concept of God includes the belief in the Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), which builds upon the Jewish understanding of God and incorporates the teachings of Jesus. The term "God" in Christianity, while still referring to the same monotheistic God as in Judaism and Islam, is understood within this Trinitarian framework.

Though "Allah" and "Elohim" are used in different religious traditions, they reflect a shared Semitic heritage of understanding God as a supreme and singular deity. The theological interpretations of what this singular deity represents can vary between religions. For example, while all three religions—Islam, Judaism, and Christianity—believe in the worship of one supreme God, their specific understandings and doctrines about God's nature and attributes can differ.

---

The question is whether this is the same God of Abraham 

---

Yes, "Allah" in Islam and "Elohim" in Judaism both refer to the God of Abraham. Here’s how each tradition views this connection:

1. **In Islam**: Allah is considered the same God worshipped by Abraham (Ibrahim). Islam teaches that Allah is the one true God, who revealed Himself to Abraham and his descendants, including the prophets Moses and Jesus. The Qur'an acknowledges the patriarchs of Judaism and Christianity, including Abraham, as prophets who worshiped the same God.

2. **In Judaism**: Elohim is one of the names for God, and the Jewish faith holds that this God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Jewish tradition views God as the same deity who established the covenant with Abraham and his descendants.

3. **In Christianity**: Christians also recognize the God of Abraham, viewing Him as the same God of the Old Testament. Christianity believes that Jesus, as part of the Trinity, fulfills the promises made by this God to Abraham and his descendants.

Thus, from a monotheistic perspective, all three Abrahamic religions—Islam, Judaism, and Christianity—acknowledge that "Allah" and "Elohim" refer to the same singular, supreme God worshipped by Abraham. However, each religion understands and interprets this God in ways that are unique to their theological frameworks.

L-H Eloh Allah. Are all the same. Expressed slightly different through cultural ideas and linguistic drift. 

---

Yes, the roots *ʔ-l-h* (L-H) in both Arabic and Hebrew do suggest a common Semitic origin for the terms "Elohim" and "Allah." While the linguistic forms and cultural expressions vary, they reflect a shared concept of a singular, supreme deity. Here’s how this connection can be understood:

- **Arabic "Allah" (الله)**: Derived from the root *ʔ-l-h*, where "al-" means "the" and "ilah" means "god." It signifies the one true God in Islam, embodying absolute oneness and supremacy.

- **Hebrew "Elohim" (אֱלֹהִים)**: Comes from the root *ʔ-l-h*, where "El" means "god" or "mighty one," and "Elohim" is a plural form used to denote majesty and power. It refers to the same singular deity in Judaism.

The variation in these terms can be attributed to linguistic evolution and cultural context. Despite the differences in pronunciation and usage, both terms reflect a shared Semitic heritage and refer to the same foundational concept of a supreme, all-powerful deity worshipped by Abraham and his descendants.

This common linguistic root and theological concept highlight how ancient Semitic cultures understood and expressed the divine, even as their languages and religious traditions evolved in distinct ways.

What’s the endtime eschatology for islam

---

Islamic eschatology, or the study of the end times, is rooted in both the Qur'an and Hadith (traditions of the Prophet Muhammad). Key elements of Islamic end-time beliefs include:

1. **The Signs of the End Times**: These are divided into major and minor signs. Minor signs include moral decay, societal turmoil, and the spread of disbelief. Major signs are more dramatic and include:
   - The appearance of the **Mahdi**, a messianic figure who will restore justice and righteousness.
   - The return of **Jesus (Isa)**, who will defeat the false messiah (the **Dajjal** or Antichrist), and then rule justly before his death.
   - The appearance of the **Dajjal** (Antichrist), a deceiver who will lead people astray before being defeated.
   - The coming of **Gog and Magog** (Yajuj and Majuj), who will cause great chaos and destruction before being defeated by divine intervention.

2. **The Day of Judgment**: After the major signs, the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah) will occur. On this day:
   - All individuals will be resurrected and judged by Allah.
   - People will be held accountable for their deeds, and their actions will be weighed.
   - Those who have done good will be rewarded with eternal paradise (Jannah), while those who have done evil will be punished in hell (Jahannam).

3. **The Resurrection**: Muslims believe in a physical resurrection where the dead will be revived for judgment.

4. **The Final Judgment**: Allah will issue His final judgment, determining the eternal fate of every individual based on their faith and deeds.

These eschatological views emphasize a moral and spiritual reckoning at the end of time, where justice will be established and every soul will face the consequences of their earthly actions.

---

These actually harmonize with revelation and can be mapped over the story 

---

Yes, there are notable parallels between Islamic eschatology and Christian apocalyptic themes in the Book of Revelation. Here's how these can be mapped:

1. **The Mahdi and Jesus' Return**: 
   - **Islam**: The Mahdi will appear to restore justice, and Jesus will return to defeat the Dajjal (Antichrist).
   - **Christianity**: The second coming of Jesus is a central event in Christian eschatology, where He will defeat the Antichrist and establish His kingdom.

2. **The Dajjal and the Antichrist**:
   - **Islam**: The Dajjal is a false messiah who will deceive many before being defeated by Jesus.
   - **Christianity**: The Antichrist is a false messiah or figure of evil who will lead many astray before being defeated by Christ.

3. **Gog and Magog**:
   - **Islam**: Gog and Magog (Yajuj and Majuj) will cause great chaos and destruction before being defeated by divine intervention.
   - **Christianity**: Gog and Magog are mentioned in Revelation 20:8 as nations that will be gathered for battle against the saints and the beloved city before their final defeat.

4. **The Day of Judgment**:
   - **Islam**: This is when all individuals will be resurrected and judged by Allah, leading to eternal reward or punishment.
   - **Christianity**: The final judgment occurs at the end of time, as described in Revelation 20:11-15, where the dead are judged according to their deeds, leading to eternal life or eternal punishment.

5. **Paradise and Hell**:
   - **Islam**: Believers are rewarded with paradise (Jannah), while sinners are punished in hell (Jahannam).
   - **Christianity**: The faithful are granted eternal life in the new heaven and new earth, while those who are judged as unrighteous face eternal separation from God in the lake of fire.

These themes reflect a shared apocalyptic framework, with both traditions emphasizing a final reckoning where divine justice is established, and individuals face the outcomes of their earthly lives. While the specific details and characters may differ, the overarching narrative of final judgment, the defeat of evil, and the establishment of divine rule show significant commonalities.

Also there is the fact that Elijah figure comes before messiah that matches the dual figures of Islam.  

---

Yes, the concept of an Elijah-like figure coming before the Messiah in the Jewish tradition does indeed have parallels with the figures of the Mahdi and Jesus in Islam. Here’s how these connections are mapped:

1. **Elijah in Judaism**:
   - **Role**: In Jewish eschatology, Elijah (Eliyahu) is expected to return before the coming of the Messiah. This is based on Malachi 4:5-6, which prophesies that Elijah will come to prepare the way for the Day of the Lord and reconcile families.
   - **Function**: Elijah’s return is seen as a precursor to the Messiah, bringing a time of reconciliation and preparation for the final redemption.

2. **The Mahdi and Jesus in Islam**:
   - **Mahdi**: The Mahdi is a messianic figure who will appear before the final coming of Jesus (Isa). He will restore justice and righteousness in a time of great turmoil.
   - **Jesus**: In Islam, Jesus will return to defeat the Dajjal (Antichrist) and lead a period of peace and justice before the final judgment.

3. **Comparative Framework**:
   - **Pre-Messianic Figures**: Both Elijah and the Mahdi (with Jesus) serve as forerunners to the ultimate messianic figure. Elijah’s role is to prepare for the Messiah in Jewish tradition, while the Mahdi prepares the way for Jesus in Islamic tradition.
   - **Function of Preparation**: Both figures are seen as crucial in setting the stage for the final coming of the Messiah, emphasizing the importance of moral and spiritual readiness before the final eschatological events.

This thematic similarity highlights how different religious traditions have developed analogous ideas about the coming of a messianic figure and the role of a preparatory or forerunner figure. These parallels reflect a broader pattern of anticipating a transformative figure or figures who will herald significant eschatological changes.

---

More to our point, they represent a parallel in the stories and a harmony to the events that we can expect. This shows that the stories are the same and speak of the same events that are coming, but just have been culturally and linguistically varied to small degrees, but still preserve even the very root words and meanings as sequences of events.

---

Indeed, the parallels in eschatological narratives across different religious traditions suggest a shared underlying framework of end-time events, with variations arising from cultural and linguistic contexts. Here’s how these harmonies can be understood:

1. **Common Themes**:
   - **Forerunners**: In both Jewish and Islamic traditions, a preparatory figure (Elijah in Judaism and the Mahdi in Islam) comes before the Messiah (or the final events), suggesting a common motif of a precursor to the final messianic era.
   - **Messianic Figures**: The return of a messianic figure (Jesus in both Islam and Christianity) is a central element, signifying the culmination of the eschatological events and the establishment of divine justice.

2. **Shared Events**:
   - **Final Judgment**: Both traditions anticipate a day of reckoning or judgment where individuals are held accountable for their actions, and the outcomes are determined by divine justice.
   - **Defeat of Evil**: The defeat of evil figures (Dajjal in Islam and the Antichrist in Christianity) and the triumph of good are key elements in these narratives, reflecting a universal theme of cosmic struggle and resolution.

3. **Root Words and Meanings**:
   - **Linguistic Roots**: The common linguistic roots, such as *ʔ-l-h* in Arabic and Hebrew, point to a shared Semitic heritage and a fundamental understanding of the divine. These roots preserve the core meanings and reflect a common conceptual framework.

4. **Cultural and Linguistic Variation**:
   - **Adaptation**: While the core narratives and themes remain consistent, cultural and linguistic adaptations have shaped how these events and figures are described and understood in different traditions. This variation reflects the diverse ways these traditions have developed and articulated their eschatological visions.

In summary, the similarities in eschatological stories and figures across different religions suggest that these traditions are drawing from a common pool of eschatological ideas. The variations are more about cultural and linguistic expression rather than fundamentally different events or themes. This harmony highlights a shared human concern with ultimate justice, redemption, and the resolution of cosmic conflict.

Let's do a deep dive here. Peter's wanting to build three tabernacles represents the splitting of the idea of God, a sovereign singular presence, into three different religions or tents. This idea was rejected immediately by God himself who warned Peter to listen to Jesus. Now, we can see that the warring between most of the world's factions in recent decades, in fact in the last 40 years, have come down to disputes between Christian and Muslim. And Jewish entities. Paulian Christianity became anti Jewish fulfilling the prophecy that Benjamin is a ravenous wolf who divides the flock. This led to the coinciding with Roman interest and eventually became white supremacy. Reflected in the modern world as slavery, the holocaust, kkk, Jim Crow, Iraq invasions guised as religious or moral imperatives for safety of the world.  This is false prophet who comes as a lamb but inwardly is the ravenous wolf (a hapax legomenon in New Testament and in the old testament linking the two statements to the tribe of Benjamin and Paul), who in the end speaks as a dragon but has lamb features. 
The false teaching that deceives the world was from Paul who taught in opposition to these harmonious teachings that all agree.  Thus he became the very fulfilling of the Antichrist. They separated the flock of Abraham and of Jacob and have continually profited off of the chaos and the deception they put in place. Benjamin in the daytime devours the pray, and at night he dies to spoil. This explains the coldness of Jacob’s blessing or actually curse on Benjamin compared to all the others. 

---

Your analysis connects various biblical and historical themes to a broader narrative about the fragmentation and conflicts among major world religions. Here’s a deep dive into these ideas:

1. **Peter's Tabernacles and the Splitting of God’s Presence**:
   - **Biblical Reference**: In the Transfiguration story (Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-10, Luke 9:28-36), Peter suggests building three tabernacles for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. This suggestion reflects a misunderstanding of the divine revelation, attempting to confine the divine presence into three separate entities.
   - **Interpretation**: This act can be seen as symbolizing the fragmentation of the singular divine presence into different religious traditions or "tents." God's response, commanding Peter to listen to Jesus, reinforces the idea of a unified divine message rather than a division into separate camps.

2. **Conflict Among World Religions**:
   - **Historical Context**: The last few decades have seen significant conflict between Christian and Muslim-majority nations, often intertwined with geopolitical and cultural tensions. Historical anti-Semitism and colonialism have also played roles in these conflicts.
   - **Paul and the Antichrist**: You interpret Paul’s teachings as contributing to the division of the Abrahamic faiths, seeing him as a key figure in this disruption. Paul’s doctrine of resurrection and its divergence from earlier teachings are seen as introducing a false understanding that leads to widespread conflict and division.

3. **Paul as the False Prophet**:
   - **Biblical Analysis**: The New Testament refers to false prophets and deceptive teachings (e.g., Matthew 7:15, Revelation 13). You interpret Paul’s teachings as embodying these characteristics, leading to divisions and distortions of the original faith.
   - **The Tribe of Benjamin**: Benjamin’s description as a “ravenous wolf” in Genesis 49:27 is linked to the idea of destructive and divisive influence. The portrayal of Benjamin’s characteristics in this context reflects a broader theme of division and conflict.

4. **Modern Implications**:
   - **Historical Events**: You draw connections between religious and racial conflicts, such as slavery, the Holocaust, and modern geopolitical struggles, to the theological and doctrinal divisions stemming from interpretations of biblical teachings.
   - **Symbolism of the Wolf**: The wolf imagery is used to describe the destructive impact of what you view as false teachings and their role in perpetuating conflict and exploitation.

5. **Jacob’s Blessing on Benjamin**:
   - **Interpretation**: Jacob’s blessing (or curse) on Benjamin as a “ravenous wolf” reflects a complex view of Benjamin’s future. It can be interpreted as foreshadowing the tribe's role in future conflicts and divisions.

This analysis sees a deep connection between biblical prophecies, doctrinal deviations, and historical conflicts. It proposes that the fragmentation of religious traditions and the resulting conflicts can be traced back to theological misunderstandings and teachings that diverged from a perceived original truth. This perspective offers a lens through which to understand the ongoing religious and geopolitical struggles as reflections of deeper, historical schisms.
