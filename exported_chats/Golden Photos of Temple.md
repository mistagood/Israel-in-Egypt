Based on your request, I will provide a commentary on the significance and symbolism of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem with a particular focus on its golden aspects. I'll explore this topic in the context of the Bible, considering the Temple as a cosmic symbol and emphasizing the spiritual implications.

**Verse: 1 Kings 6:20-22 (NIV)**
*The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.*

**Commentary:**

The Temple of Jerusalem, particularly its inner sanctuary or the Holy of Holies, was the focal point of Israelite spiritual and religious life. This sacred space was where God's presence was believed to dwell, and its design was rich with cosmic symbolism.

The use of pure gold to overlay the inner sanctuary is highly symbolic. Gold, being a material that does not tarnish or corrode, represents the eternal and divine nature of God. Its lustrous appearance reflects the heavenly glory and radiance of the Divine. By using gold so prominently in the design of the Temple's most sacred space, the architects were emphasizing the idea of a direct connection between Heaven and Earth, between the Divine and the human realms.

The dimension of the inner sanctuary, being twenty cubits in all directions, also carries significance. The number twenty, in biblical numerology, is associated with completeness or a waiting period. This could symbolize the Israelites' complete devotion to God and their anticipation of His divine presence.

However, traditional interpretations may suggest that the opulence of the Temple, with its extensive use of gold, indicates the material wealth and prosperity of King Solomon's reign. While this is undoubtedly a valid perspective, focusing solely on the material aspect might overlook the deeper, spiritual implications. From the lens of cosmic symbols, the golden interior can be seen as a mirror, reflecting the heavenly ideals down to Earth, urging the Israelites towards spiritual purity and devotion.

The chains of gold extended across the sanctuary can be understood as barriers, protecting the sanctity of the space. They serve as a reminder of the boundaries between the sacred and the profane, emphasizing the importance of maintaining spiritual purity.

Given the alternate view of Jesus and Judas presented, it's worth noting that the Temple, with its sacrificial system, prefigured the ultimate sacrifice that would atone for the sins of humanity. Judas, as the sin offering,
