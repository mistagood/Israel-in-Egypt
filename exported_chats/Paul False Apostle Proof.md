# Paul False Apostle Proof



---



---

So my goal here is to give a presentation showing that Paul, proving, giving proof that Paul is a false apostle, is the false prophet of the Bible who is talked about from the beginning, from Genesis all the way to Revelation. And what I'll need is evidence and suggestions from you as I give you my points. I'll need my points laid out into bullet points and supporting biblical verses so that I can present the information at a later time in an organized format.

Got it. Let’s start structuring your presentation by laying out the core points, and then we’ll support them with scriptural evidence. If you already have specific arguments or passages in mind, let me know, and I’ll expand on them with references and analysis.

Here’s a potential outline for your presentation:

### **Title: Paul - The False Apostle and the Prophesied False Prophet**

How does this framework look to you? Let me know if you want to adjust, add specific points, or focus on any section in more detail.

So what I need you to do is actually quote the specific bible verses and I'm starting with Genesis where Moses wrote about the two trees. One is a pure life and one is a mixed fruit. This is which contains life and death. So Paul's doctrine of life through the death of Jesus Christ is the second tree. Moses's law is the first tree. All right, so this is Genesis. This is the beginning. Then we can go into some of the other supporting details that you mentioned there, but the next thing that I want to also bring about is Moses's test of a false prophet where he says that you'll know false prophet because when they say this word has come from the Lord, if it doesn't happen, then you'll know that that person hasn't come. Also, Moses talks about false prophets in Deuteronomy 13. The test of loving the Lord your God and not being led astray, so not following any other any other doctrine or a false prophet is the test. So he talks about a test will come. So here we connect that Paul is actually the serpent in the garden who whispers eloquent words to deceive people and give them false hope of life. Connecting this, we want to go to the story of Jonah where Jonah acts as a wicked prophet who runs away from the duty that God has given him to save people because he feels that God is a forgiving God and will forgive them anyway. So Jonah says, I knew that you would forgive them anyway. This is a reflection of Paul's doctrine of forgiveness without the law. And so Paul becomes the great tester of Israel, but we see that Jesus was only sent to the lost sheep and that another prophet will have to be sent to the Gentiles because he had another fold that will bring in. So we'll talk about Paul as the wolf that Jesus describes. And so at this point, we need to talk about Jacob's blessings and the curse of the actual curse on Benjamin that he's a rapist wolf that divides the flock. And this is also what Jesus says about a false prophet. So we know that this is a false prophet. We know that Peter was to go to the Gentiles, but he was the hired hand that Jesus spoke of in Matthew. And so we need to pull that verse as well, because when he talks about the hired hand who runs away when the wolf comes, then he's talking specifically about Peter running away and Paul becoming the leader of the mission to the Gentiles. Okay. So that's a direct analogy again there. So I want to start there. And so all of the work that you do here is very good with Jesus warnings against false prophets. Also the work in Isaiah with the covenant of death and all of that is to remain intact and be expanded on with the verses. Also Paul's conversion story is being inconsistent, but also the men of Jerusalem recognizing Paul as that man who brings Gentiles into the temple and teaches people everywhere against that place and the law. And so throughout the Bible, we see these examples of Paul being the false prophet and being recognized as such, and even himself admitting to this, as you pointed out, with these other verses where he Christ crucified as a stumbling block to Jews and folly to the Greeks, as well as where he admits to be a liar for Christ. But we know that if a man that Jesus said, when he speaks of lie, he speaks of his own because he was the father of lies. He's the creation of lies. There's no truth in him. So that's another direct parallel. And then we have a verse that says, there's no truth in him. So that's another direct parallel. And so we want to pull these specifically out as well as many of the other things that you mentioned, but I want to be more specific with them.

### **Presentation: Paul as the False Apostle and the Prophesied False Prophet from Genesis to Revelation**  

---

## **I. The Two Trees in Genesis: The Law of Moses vs. Paul’s Doctrine**
- **Genesis 2:9** – “And out of the ground the LORD God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”
  - The **Tree of Life** represents the pure way, God’s law as given to Moses.
  - The **Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil** represents mixed fruit—life and death. Paul’s doctrine of life through Jesus' death is this second tree.
  
- **Genesis 3:1-5** – The serpent deceives Eve with eloquent words, persuading her to eat from the forbidden tree, which leads to death.
  - Paul, like the serpent, brings a mixed doctrine—salvation through the death of Jesus.
  - **2 Corinthians 11:3** – “But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.”

---

## **II. The Test of a False Prophet (Deuteronomy)**
- **Deuteronomy 13:1-5** – “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or wonder, and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ you shall not listen to the words of that prophet… For the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.”
  - Paul fails this test by leading people away from the Law and preaching another gospel.

- **Deuteronomy 18:20-22** – “But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die. And if you say in your heart, ‘How may we know the word that the LORD has not spoken?’—when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken.”
  - Paul made predictions that failed, proving he was not sent by God.

---

## **III. Jonah as a Type of Paul: The Reluctant Prophet Who Runs**
- **Jonah 4:1-3** – Jonah was angry because God forgave Nineveh, proving that he believed salvation should not come without judgment.
  - Paul, like Jonah, promotes forgiveness without the law, contradicting God’s justice.
  - **Romans 10:4** – “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.” 
    - Paul abolishes the law, while God in the Old Testament upholds it.

---

## **IV. The Prophecy Against Benjamin: The Ravenous Wolf**
- **Genesis 49:27** – “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil.”
  - Paul, a Benjamite (Philippians 3:5), fulfills this prophecy by dividing the church and leading people away from the Law.
  - **Matthew 7:15-16** – “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.”
    - Paul’s “fruit” is lawlessness, contradicting Jesus.

---

## **V. The Hired Hand Who Abandons the Sheep (Peter)**
- **John 10:12-13** – “He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.”
  - Peter was the hired hand who abandoned the sheep (Gentiles).
  - **Galatians 2:11-12** – Paul rebukes Peter for withdrawing from Gentiles, then takes over the mission himself.
  - **Acts 9:15** – Paul claims he was chosen to bring the message to the Gentiles, but Jesus already commissioned Peter in **Matthew 28:19-20**.

---

## **VI. Jesus’ Warnings Against False Prophets**
- **Matthew 24:4-5** – “See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.”
  - Paul claims to preach Christ, yet teaches a different doctrine.

- **Matthew 7:21-23** – “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”
  - Paul’s doctrine abolishes the law, making him a worker of lawlessness.

---

## **VII. Paul’s Contradictions and False Conversion**
- **Acts 9:3-7 vs. Acts 22:6-9** – Conflicting accounts of his Damascus vision.
- **Matthew 24:26** – Jesus warns against those who claim to see Him in secret places.
  - Paul’s vision contradicts Jesus’ teachings.

- **Acts 21:27-29** – “This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place.”
  - The Jews in Jerusalem identify Paul as the man leading others away from the law.

---

## **VIII. Paul Admits to Deception**
- **1 Corinthians 1:23** – “But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles.”
  - Paul himself calls his doctrine a stumbling block.
- **Romans 3:7** – “For if the truth of God has increased through my lie to His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?”
  - Paul openly admits to lying.
- **John 8:44** – Jesus says the devil is the father of lies, and there is no truth in him.
  - Paul aligns himself with deception.

---

## **IX. Paul’s Doctrine Mirrors the False Prophet of Revelation**
- **Revelation 2:2** – “I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.”
  - The Ephesians reject Paul.
- **Revelation 13:11-18** – The second beast (false prophet) deceives many.
  - Paul leads the world into the doctrine of the cross.
- **Revelation 17:5-6** – The whore of Babylon drinks the blood of the saints.
  - Paul’s doctrine led to persecution of those who kept the Law.

---

## **X. Paul Preaches Another Gospel**
- **Galatians 1:6-9** – Paul curses anyone who preaches another gospel, yet he himself preaches differently from Jesus.
- **2 Corinthians 11:13-15** – “For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.”
  - Paul condemns false apostles, but his own actions fit this description.
- **1 Timothy 4:1-3** – Paul warns about those who forbid marriage and command abstinence from certain foods.
  - This is found in **Catholicism**, which is based on Pauline doctrine.

---

## **XI. Revelation’s Final Warning**
- **Revelation 22:18-19** – “If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.”
  - Paul added to the Gospel.
- **Revelation 14:12** – “Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.”
  - Paul preached against keeping the commandments.

---

## **Conclusion**
- Paul is the serpent who whispers deception.
- He fulfills the false prophet prophecy from Genesis to Revelation.
- His doctrine contradicts Jesus and the Law.
- True believers must reject Paul’s teachings and return to the original message of Jesus.
