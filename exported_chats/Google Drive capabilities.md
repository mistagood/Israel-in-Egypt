What can you do with Google Drive since you now have access to my Google Drive?

---



---



---

Here is the exact, clear list of everything I **can** and **cannot** do with your Google Drive, now that you’ve connected it. This is precise and tool-accurate.

---

# **WHAT I *CAN* DO WITH YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE**

### **1. Search your Google Drive documents**
I can search across **all files you have access to**, including:
- Google Docs  
- Google Sheets  
- Google Slides  
- PDFs, text files, and most other document formats

Searches can be:
- Keyword-based  
- Phrase-based  
- Time-filtered (if you specify a time window)  
- Owner-filtered (e.g., “my documents only”)  
- Navigation-targeted (“find the file titled X”)  

### **2. Open specific files**
After finding a file through search, I can:
- **Open it**  
- **Read its full contents**  
- **Pull exact lines / paragraphs**  
- **Extract data or text**  
- **Summarize or analyze the content**

### **3. Extract, analyze, and work with data**
After a file is opened, I can:
- Read text  
- Extract tables, data ranges  
- Summarize long documents  
- Compare documents  
- Build timelines, genealogy lists, or cross-references based on the contents  
- Pull quotations verbatim

### **4. Open links found inside Drive files**
If a document contains:
- A Google Doc link  
- A Sheet link  
- A Notion link  
- A Drive file link  

I can follow them and open the referenced file.

### **5. Search multiple sources at once**
I can run searches across:
- **Google Drive**
- (If connected) GitHub repos, issues, pull requests, commits

In a single multi-source search.

### **6. Use advanced search strategies**
I can:
- Use semantic search
- Use keyword boosts (`+keyword`)
- Use QDF freshness weighting
- Use multi-query blends (up to 5 queries at once)
- Use navigational intent to retrieve specific documents

### **7. Return file navigation lists**
If your query is “find me the doc…”, I will generate a **file navlist**:
A visually rendered list with clickable items.

# **WHAT I *CANNOT* DO**

### **1. I cannot list all your Drive files**
This is forbidden.  
I cannot answer:
- “What documents do I have?”
- “List all my Google Drive files.”

### **2. I cannot browse your folders**
No folder-level visibility:
- I cannot see folder names
- I cannot see directory structures
- I cannot access folder metadata

### **3. I cannot monitor or auto-watch Drive for updates**
No change-tracking, no subscriptions.

### **4. I cannot modify, write, delete, or edit your files**
Drive access is **read-only**:
- No writing to Docs
- No saving into Drive
- No overwriting files
- No reorganizing storage

### **5. I cannot access files you don’t have permission to access**
The tool enforces user permissions.

### **6. I can’t guess file names**
If you don’t give any clue or keyword, I can’t find it.

# **THE REAL POWER IS THIS:**
With your Drive connected, I can now help you:

### **A. Build your scholarly Bible project directly from your Drive files**
- Open your long biblical markdown documents  
- Expand sections professionally  
- Add factual research  
- Structure chapters  
- Extract your own notes and integrate them  
- Annotate and create scholarly commentary based on your actual files

### **B. Manage your creative pipelines**
- Open your research notes  
- Extract genealogical tables  
- Build timelines and cross-references  
- Prepare publishable outlines  
- Pull Hebrew word studies from your notes  
- Compare your iterations across files

### **C. Support your technical projects**
If you store:
- Python scripts  
- Project notes  
- Technical specifications  
- Audio/video plans  

I can open and reference them while we build next modules.

### **D. Integrate your Drive documents into your writing workflow**
You can:
- Tell me “open *Document X*”  
- Tell me “search for any file mentioning Akhenaten’s co-regency”  
- Tell me “find my notes on Ezekiel 12”  

And I can then open, read, and work with your real content.

# **SIMPLE EXAMPLES OF COMMANDS YOU CAN NOW USE**

### **Find a specific doc**
“Search my Drive for ‘Joseph 17 years’ and show me the files.”

### **Open a doc**
“Open the file titled ‘Ephraim chronology working draft’.”

### **Extract content**
“Pull out every section from that document where I mention Benjamin.”

### **Work with spreadsheets**
“Open the sheet where I calculated the genealogy counts.”

### **Compare files**
“Find every doc in my Drive that mentions ‘Asenath,’ and show me the differences.”

---

If you want, you can test the connection now by asking:

**“Search my Google Drive for anything mentioning ‘Ephraim’.”**

I will run the search and produce a file navigation list.

Do it

Here are the documents in your Google Drive that contain **“Ephraim”**, retrieved through your connected Drive. Since your request was **navigational**, the correct response is a **file navigation list**.

filenavlist0:0Topical Bible Study document containing extensive Ephraim verse listings.0:5Another Ephraim verse-collection document with similar structure but different creation timestamp.0:10A topical study template titled **“Jethro”** that also includes an Ephraim section.

If you want to **open** any of these files so I can read the full text and work with it, just tell me:

“Open item 1”  
or  
“Open the first Ephraim document.”
