# Ephraim Manasseh Birth Inquiry

What does the Bible say about Ephraim and Manassas’s birth? Is it possible that they were twins?

The Bible describes Ephraim and Manasseh as the two sons of Joseph and his Egyptian wife Asenath. They are not explicitly identified as twins. According to Genesis 41:50-52, Ephraim and Manasseh were born during the seven years of abundance before the famine in Egypt. 

Manasseh was born first, and his name means "making forget" because Joseph named him to signify that God had made him forget all his trouble and his father’s house. Ephraim was born second, and his name means "fruitful" because Joseph said God had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction (Genesis 41:51-52).

The Bible does not mention them being twins; rather, it presents them as brothers born sequentially.

Right, but what is the text? I want to look at the actual text.

Certainly! Here are the relevant texts from the Bible regarding the birth of Ephraim and Manasseh:

**Genesis 41:50-52 (NIV):**

50 Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.  
51 Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”  
52 The second son he named Ephraim and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”

You can find these passages in the Book of Genesis, which provides details about their birth and the meaning behind their names.
