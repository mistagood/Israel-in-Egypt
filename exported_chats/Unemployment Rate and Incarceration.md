# Unemployment Rate and Incarceration



---



---

When it comes to the number of people unemployed in the U.S., do those numbers include individuals in prison or are those just people in the workforce? So when we talk about the high percentage of African Americans or so-called African Americans or black people out of work, are we including the people in prison or just those who are out looking for jobs or out of jobs in the workforce?

**Clarifying unemployment measurement**

I’m piecing together how the US unemployment rate is calculated, highlighting that prisoners are excluded from the official count, which includes only those actively seeking work.

**Clarifying labor force metrics**

I'm mapping out that the official unemployment statistics for African Americans exclude prisoners, focusing solely on those actively seeking or holding employment.

**Mapping labor force dynamics**

I'm piecing together that African Americans' unemployment rates exclude prisoners, focusing only on those seeking or holding jobs, which clarifies the labor force's demographic distribution.

**Tracking unemployment trends**

OK, let's think this through: official unemployment stats exclude prisoners and the institutionalized. This exclusion highlights the reality that including these groups would notably increase the unemployment rate.

The short answer is that the “official” unemployment figures in the United States do not include people who are currently in prison. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) focuses on the “civilian noninstitutional population,” meaning people 16 years or older who are not on active military duty and not housed in institutions such as prisons or mental health facilities. 

In practical terms, someone in prison is not counted as unemployed because they’re not considered part of the labor force at all. The labor force is made up of two main groups:
• People with jobs (the employed).
• People without jobs who are actively looking for work (the unemployed).

Everyone else—those not working and not actively looking, and those who are institutionalized—is considered “not in the labor force.” So when we see statistics stating a high percentage of African Americans or Black people are unemployed, that usually reflects only those who are free, able to work, and are either employed or actively seeking a job. It does not automatically capture the significant number of individuals behind bars.

So how many African American males between the ages of 18 and 65 are in prison in the United States?

To get you the most accurate and up-to-date information, could you clarify if you'd like:

1. The most recent numbers available as of 2024/2025?
2. Data broken down by state or nationwide total?
3. Only federal prison numbers, or federal plus state and local jails?

Let me know how detailed you'd like this to be.

The most recent nationwide totals for federal and state and local jails combined

Got it. I’ll gather the most recent nationwide statistics on the number of African American males between the ages of 18 and 65 who are incarcerated in federal, state, and local jails combined. I’ll let you know once I have the data ready.

# African American Male Incarceration in the U.S. (Latest Data)

## Total Number Incarcerated (Ages 18–65)
Nationwide, there are **roughly half a million African American males (age 18–65) incarcerated** in the United States in recent years. This figure includes individuals held in federal prisons, state prisons, and local jails. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), **state and federal prisons held about 1,185,600 sentenced inmates at year-end 2022**, of whom approximately **384,600 (32%) were Black**【28†L1-L4】【5†L584-L592】. Local jails held another **663,100 inmates as of mid-2022**【6†L154-L162】, about **35% of whom were Black**【10†L150-L158】 (roughly ~232,000 Black individuals). Combining prisons and jails, an estimated **600,000+ African Americans** were behind bars in 2022. Since the **vast majority of incarcerated persons are male** (about 93% of prison inmates and 86% of jail inmates)【5†L580-L588】【12†L593-L601】, this implies on the order of **~500,000 to 550,000** of those incarcerated were **African American males between 18 and 65**.

## Incarceration Rate and Population Share
【27†embed_image】 **Disproportionate Incarceration of Black Americans:** African American men are incarcerated at vastly higher rates than other groups. For example, in **2018 about 2,272 out of every 100,000 Black men** were in state or federal prison – **nearly six times** the rate for white men (392 per 100,000)【1†L178-L186】. Recent data show this gap persists: as of 2021, Black men were still imprisoned at **5.5 times the rate of white men**【21†L219-L227】. If one includes local jails, the overall incarceration rate remains starkly uneven. At mid-2022, **Black Americans were jailed at about 558 per 100,000** residents – over **3.4 times** the rate for white Americans (162 per 100,000)【10†L169-L177】. In total, **Black Americans (predominantly males)** make up roughly **one-third of the U.S. incarcerated population**, far exceeding their share of the U.S. population (about 12–13%)【1†L185-L193】. In other words, **Black males (~6% of the U.S. adult population) comprise around 30% of all inmates nationwide**, underscoring a major racial disparity in incarceration.

## Recent Trends in Black Male Incarceration
【26†embed_image】 **Declining Imprisonment Rates:** Notably, the incarceration of African American males has **declined in recent years**. Bureau of Justice Statistics data indicate that the **imprisonment rate for Black Americans fell by about 37% from 2010 to 2020**【14†L99-L107】. In fact, the imprisonment rate of Black men in 2021 was **almost half of what it was in 2000** (a 48% drop)【21†L219-L227】. This downward trend can be seen in the chart (right), which shows Black incarceration rates peaking in the 2000s and steadily decreasing through the 2010s【26†】. The total number of Black inmates in state/federal prisons also dropped from about **590,300 in 2006 to 465,200 in 2018** (a 21% decrease)【1†L192-L198】. **Despite these improvements, disparities remain pronounced** – Black males are still incarcerated at several times the rate of their white counterparts, and they continue to represent a disproportionate share of the prison and jail population. Policymakers note that while progress has been made, further reforms are needed to address the persistent overrepresentation of Black men in U.S. correctional facilities【21†L219-L227】【1†L185-L193】.

**Sources:** Official data from the **Bureau of Justice Statistics** (U.S. Department of Justice) were used for these figures, including the *Prisoners in 2022* and *Jail Inmates in 2022* statistical reports【28†L1-L4】【10†L150-L158】. Additional context on rates and trends comes from reputable research organizations analyzing BJS data (Pew Research Center and The Sentencing Project)【1†L178-L186】【21†L219-L227】. These sources provide the most recent nationwide statistics on incarcerated African American males and highlight the ongoing racial disparities in U.S. incarceration.
