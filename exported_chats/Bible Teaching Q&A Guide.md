# Bible Teaching Q&A Guide



---

i need some good starter questions to guide me in podcast/interview style (solo) recording to open up some lanes on the bible teachings I have. All the questions people throw at me like If jesus didnt die on the cross why does Paul say he did? How are people saved then? 
who is teaching you this (where are you getting this from)? Questions about theory, faith, scapegoat, all in context of how they can try to make sense of what I'm saying given their current beliefs. They find it incredible and immediately begin to quote Paul and the gospels about jesus dying and saving the world. I need like a Q and A session where I explain. But I need the q's from you!

### 🔥 Core Questions They’re *Dying* to Ask (but don’t know how to)
1. **If Jesus didn’t die on the cross, then what actually happened at Golgotha?**
2. **Why would the gospels say Jesus was crucified if he wasn’t? Were they lying—or is there something deeper going on?**
3. **How can anyone be saved if Jesus didn’t die for our sins? Isn’t that the whole point of the gospel?**
4. **Are you saying Paul was wrong? Isn’t most of the New Testament based on his writings?**
5. **If Paul misled people, why would God allow that to happen? Doesn’t that make the Bible untrustworthy?**
6. **Where are you getting this from? Did someone teach you this, or are you just interpreting the Bible your own way?**
7. **So then what do you believe the purpose of Jesus was, if not to die and resurrect?**
8. **Are you saying the crucifixion was staged or symbolic? Isn’t that heresy?**
9. **How do you explain verses like 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul says 'if Christ didn’t rise, our faith is in vain'?**
10. **What does salvation even mean if there's no death and resurrection? Is it just about keeping the law again?**
11. **Didn’t Isaiah 53 say that the Messiah would be crushed and bear our iniquities? Who fulfilled that?**
12. **Isn’t it dangerous to reinterpret the gospel this way? Aren’t you leading people away from Christ?**
13. **Why would God set up an atonement system that’s so easy to misunderstand? Why make it symbolic at all?**
14. **Why does almost everyone believe Jesus died and rose again if it's not true? Could all the churches be wrong?**
15. **How do you know Judas, not Jesus, was the one who died? Isn’t that just speculation?**
16. **What do you think Jesus meant when he said 'I lay down my life'?**
17. **If Jesus didn’t die, why was the tomb empty?**
18. **How does this tie back to the Torah? Where’s the link between Leviticus and the gospel story?**
19. **Is your interpretation based on Hebrew understanding, or are you rejecting the New Testament altogether?**
20. **Are you restoring something ancient—or inventing something new?**

Okay, now I need questions that frame out an interview that lets me explain about this indigenous or the real history of the people who are enslaved here and the lost tribes, who we are, the lies of history, um, how people were reclassified as black instead of being the original owners of this land, the consequences and so forth, all of my theory there. So I need questions focused around that that lets me explain that and break all that down.
