# "Covenant with Death" Explained



---



---

Exploring the covenants in the Bible to understand what is the covenant with death and agreement with Hell mentioned in Isaiah 28. This is a chapter analysis. The only logical explanation for the covenant with death is Paul’s resurrection doctrine, which distorts Christ’s message of life, and replaces it with a doctrine of death and resurrection as a new covenant to overcome death and hell, saying that those who believe will not be Involved in the scourge that comes to nonbelievers. Let’s take a deep look at this chapter and the lack of following Gods law in the Christian church. Isaiah is referring to the drunkards who stumble off strong drink, the same as the woman drunk off the blood of saints in revelation. This is the remnant of Israel, Ephraim in America, the wilderness of captivity. The false prophet of Israel (Ezekiel 13, rev 13) that leads the whole world astray, who is a wolf (benjamite -ravenous wolf)  among lambs, devouring the prey with his mouth (words and letters spreading false doctrines). A wolf in lambs clothing, a lamb who speaks like the serpent (dragon). The chapter warns the preachers, who teach these doctrines to the people.

### Isaiah 28: A Scholarly and Mystic Commentary

#### Verse: Isaiah 28:15
*"Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves."*

#### Commentary
Isaiah 28 is a chapter that serves as a stern warning to Ephraim, often symbolically representing the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The "covenant with death" and "agreement with hell" are metaphors that Isaiah employs to critique the false sense of security that the Israelites have developed. They believe that their alliances or their distorted religious practices will save them from divine judgment.

The "covenant with death" can be seen as a precursor to Paul's resurrection doctrine, which promises eternal life through death and resurrection. This doctrine, while seemingly offering a way to overcome death, actually perpetuates a cycle of misunderstanding the true essence of life as taught by Christ. It replaces the original covenant of life and law with a new covenant focused on death.

The "drunkards" Isaiah refers to are not just those intoxicated by wine but are also intoxicated by false doctrines and misleading teachings. This mirrors the imagery in Revelation of the woman "drunk with the blood of the saints." Both are symbolic of a spiritual drunkenness, a deviation from the true path.

The false prophet, as described in Ezekiel 13 and Revelation 13, can be seen as a "wolf in lamb's clothing." This wolf is a Benjamite, a "ravenous wolf" that devours the prey with words and letters, spreading false doctrines. The chapter serves as a warning to preachers who disseminate these distorted teachings.

The Hebrew term for "covenant" is "ברית" (berith), and for "death," it is "מָוֶת" (mavet). The covenant with "mavet" is a deviation from the original "berith" that God established, which was meant to bring life and adherence to divine law.

#### Flaws in Traditional Interpretations
Traditional interpretations often overlook the depth of the metaphors and symbols that Isaiah employs. They may see the "covenant with death" as merely a political alliance or a simple misunderstanding of God's will. However, the chapter is a complex tapestry of cosmic symbols warning against the spiritual decay that comes from abandoning God's law.

#### Plausibility of Suggested View
The chapter serves as a timeless warning to those who would replace the original divine covenant with a distorted doctrine. It is not merely a historical account but a living prophecy that warns against spiritual complacency and the dangers of false teachings.

#### Conclusion
Isaiah 28 serves as a cautionary tale, warning the Israelites and, by extension, all believers, against the perils of spiritual drunkenness and false doctrines. It calls us back to the original covenant of life and law, urging us to reject the false sense of security offered by distorted teachings.

Text of covenants 7,8,9: 

---

Certainly, here are the texts for covenants 7, 8, and 9 as found in the Bible:

### 7. New Covenant
#### Jeremiah 31:31-34 (NIV)
*"The days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them," declares the Lord. "This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time," declares the Lord. "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest," declares the Lord. "For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."*

#### Hebrews 8:8-12 (NIV)
*But God found fault with the people and said: "The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."*

Amen.*

These covenants encapsulate the essence of God's relationship with humanity, each offering unique promises and revealing different facets of divine love and commitment.

As we can, see, number seven is not a covenant, but a promise of a future covenant. So as far as old testament covenants being made, seven does not qualify. Thus we look at the book of acts and Hebrews as proof of a new covenant. We know that these books are not reliable because these are from sources favorable to Paul. These are the leaven that Jesus warned about and Paul is the Pharisee he warns of. 
We can see that, without the doctrine of death and resurrection of Christ. There can still be a fulfillment of Moses, his covenant with God through the scapegoat ritual. As Jesus said, the one who shares this cup with me, will be in heaven with me when James and John asked if they could be by his side. so we understand that Luke’s interpretation of a new covenant true blood may be just that, Luke’s interpretation… text for print

### Revisiting the Concept of the New Covenant: A Critical Examination

#### The Question of the New Covenant
The New Covenant, often cited from Jeremiah 31 and later reiterated in the books of Acts and Hebrews, has been a cornerstone of Christian theology. However, it's crucial to scrutinize the sources that affirm this covenant, particularly when they are closely aligned with Pauline doctrine. 

#### The Pauline Influence
The books of Acts and Hebrews are generally considered to be favorable to Paul's teachings. Given that Paul is a figure who has been critiqued for distorting the original teachings of Christ and Moses, the reliability of these books comes into question. Jesus warned against the "leaven of the Pharisees," and it's worth considering whether Paul, himself a Pharisee, is the very source of doctrinal distortion that Jesus cautioned against.

#### The Doctrine of Death and Resurrection
The doctrine of death and resurrection, central to Pauline theology, serves as the basis for the New Covenant in mainstream Christian thought. However, if one were to remove this doctrine, the question arises: Is there still room for a New Covenant that fulfills the Mosaic law? 

#### The Scapegoat Ritual as Fulfillment
The Mosaic Covenant included the scapegoat ritual, a symbolic act of atonement. Jesus, in his role as the scapegoat for humanity, could still fulfill the Mosaic Covenant without the need for death and resurrection. When Jesus spoke to James and John about sharing his cup, he was perhaps alluding to a different kind of covenant, one that aligns more closely with the original Mosaic law.

#### Luke's Interpretation
The Gospel of Luke presents the Last Supper as the establishment of a New Covenant through Jesus' blood. However, this could very well be Luke's interpretation rather than a universal truth. Given that Luke was a companion of Paul, his account may be influenced by Pauline theology.

#### Conclusion
The concept of the New Covenant, as traditionally understood, is deeply entwined with Pauline doctrine and the books that support it. A critical examination reveals that it's possible to understand the fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant through other means, such as the scapegoat ritual. This calls for a reevaluation of what the New Covenant truly represents, separate from Pauline influences.

But why would god allow such a trick? To give an entire book which people believed to be the infallible word of God and then to allow that book to and snare his people? Well, that is a good question in the Bible has the answer. In fact, the Bible itself tells you that there is such a trick and that it will deceive the entire world and it warns you. Over and over again, we see the same trick. The devil comes to test the chosen. He even tried to beguile Jesus Christ himself. How much more so you? 
If the garden of Eden was perfect, and there was a tree in it, that caused death yet you were free to eat of it if you chose to why wouldn’t the Bible as gods infallible word also contain The same element

### The Divine Test: Deception and Discernment in the Biblical Narrative

#### The Question of Divine Trickery
One of the most perplexing questions in religious thought is why an omnipotent and benevolent God would allow His infallible word to become a snare for His people. The Bible itself, however, provides clues that such a test of faith is not only possible but also a

Start with the garden of eden. The angel question is, why did God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden if he didn’t want the people to eat from it? We know the answer but it’s an elementary way to then expand to the entire bible containing the two trees. Explaining the tempter and Pauls divergence leading Israel astray 

---

### The Two Trees: From the Garden of Eden to the Bible as a Whole

#### The Enigma of the Garden
The Garden of Eden serves as the archetypal setting for the human encounter with divine prohibition and temptation. The presence of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil raises a fundamental question: Why would God place such a tree in the Garden if He did not want Adam and Eve to eat from it?

#### The Purpose of the Tree
The answer lies in the concept of free will and the test of obedience. The tree serves as a choice, a point of moral and spiritual decision-making. God's command not to eat from the tree is a directive that necessitates the existence of an option to disobey. In essence, the tree represents the human capacity for choice, and by extension, the potential for both obedience and disobedience.

#### The Bible as a Garden with Two Trees
Expanding this idea to the Bible as a whole, one could argue that the Scriptures also contain "two trees": the Tree of Life, representing the true teachings that lead to spiritual enlightenment and eternal life, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, symbolizing teachings that, while seemingly wise, lead to spiritual death. Just as Adam and Eve had to choose, readers of the Bible are also faced with choices about what to accept and what to question.

#### The Tempter and the Test
Throughout the Bible, the Tempter appears to test the chosen ones, from Adam and Eve to Jesus Christ. The Tempter's role is to offer the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, to entice individuals away from divine truth. In the broader biblical narrative, Paul can be seen as a figure akin to the Tempter for Israel. His teachings, particularly the doctrine of death and resurrection, diverge from the Mosaic law and lead people astray, much like the fruit of the forbidden tree.

#### Conclusion
The presence of the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden serves as a foundational metaphor for understanding the complexities of the Bible itself. Just as the tree was a test of obedience and discernment, so too is the Bible a test for its readers. It contains both the path to eternal life and the potential for spiritual misguidance. The challenge for believers is to discern between the two, to choose the Tree of Life over the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

No, we understand that Adam was given an original law to not eat from the tree. Then God made Eve. But she had not heard the directive to not eat from the tree, because God had given it before she was created. So therefore, there was a law for Adam before the creation of Eve. Now, when Eve ate from the tree, should Adam have eaten also from it? No because it was Adam, who was told that in the day that he ate from me, he would die. And no where in the Bible is it written that Eve died. So Adam died for his sins, but Eve became the mother of all living . And this should tell us that what comes after is create it for a different purpose, and should complement and be compatible to what came before just as he was complementary to Adam who came before. 
Likewise, if God created Israel and gave a law to them, and created a covenant with them, that should be everlasting, and then he created a later nation to join Israel, for as it is written, I will draw all men unto me, then, if Gentiles were not given the law, but Israel was given the law. Israel should not follow the Gentiles, but the Gentiles to follow Israel just as Adam should not have followed Eve, but Eve should have followed Adam because Adam had the more perfect teaching. Because his teaching came before and came directly from God. the ladder is built on the former the student is not greater than his teacher. How then have we gone the way of Adam? Well, it is because we have all sinned and are sons of Adam. The Israelites have sinned and lusted after the teachings of the Christian movement. When they should’ve by now refined all the teachings of the Christians, so that they would be more perfect in God‘s law. So now should the second Adam also do as the first Adam did and forsake the original law of God? God, for bid it is written that the 2 should become one flesh, and so it was written that a man will forsake his mother and his father, but that he would also join and become one flesh with his wife. And in this he must sanctify her and bring her back home. This is the return to Israel. Expand part by part

### The Two Adams, The Two Laws: A Journey from Eden to Israel and Beyond

#### The Original Law and the Creation of Eve
Adam was given a specific directive from God not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. This law was given before the creation of Eve, who was not privy to this original command. When Eve ate the fruit, Adam faced a moral dilemma: should he follow Eve or adhere to the original law given to him by God? Adam chose to follow Eve, and as a result, he died, fulfilling God's warning. Eve, however, did not die and became "the mother of all living."

#### The Implications for Israel and the Gentiles
The story of Adam and Eve serves as a metaphor for the relationship between Israel and the Gentiles. Israel, like Adam, was given an original law—the Mosaic Covenant. The Gentiles, like Eve, were not initially part of this covenant. When God says, "I will draw all men unto me," it implies that the Gentiles are to be grafted into the original covenant with Israel, not the other way around. Israel should not abandon its original law to follow the teachings of the Gentile Christian movement, just as Adam should not have abandoned God's original command to follow Eve.

#### The Ladder and the Teacher
The teachings that come later should build upon and refine what came before. The student is not greater than the teacher, and the latter teachings are not greater than the former. Israel, having the original law, should serve as the teacher to the Christian movement, refining and perfecting its teachings in alignment with God's original law.

#### The Way of Adam and the Way of Israel
The Israelites, like Adam, have faced the temptation to abandon their original law. They have been enticed by the teachings of the Christian movement, which diverge from the Mosaic law. This is akin to Adam's mistake of following Eve instead of adhering to God's original command.

#### The Second Adam and the Return to Israel
The concept of the "Second Adam" in Christian theology often refers to Christ, who is seen as rectifying the mistakes of the first Adam. If the first Adam represents the forsaking of God's original law, then the Second Adam should embody the return to that law. The Second Adam has the task of sanctifying and refining the teachings that have come after, leading to a "return to Israel" or a return to the original law.

#### Conclusion
The narrative from Eden to Israel serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of adhering to original divine directives. Just as Adam should have adhered to God's original law, so too should Israel hold fast to the Mosaic Covenant. The task now is for the "Second Adam" to lead the way in returning to the original law, sanctifying the teachings that have come after, and fulfilling the divine plan of making the "two become one flesh" in a spiritual union of original law and subsequent teachings.

Parallel the garden, serpent, Eve and Adam and the covenant of death Paul’s teachings Christianity and Israelites. Analyze the serpents hissing as Paul’s seducing letters. The serpent used a twisted form of the truth and a lie saying I am pretending to ask. Did God say that you can’t eat anything in reality? God has said that all things are possible, but that they should not eat from one because it work lead to death. The serpent told her that she would not die, but that her eyes would be opened and she would become like God (able to judge between good and evil). Paul says that if we believe in his doctrines that we will not die, but in a twinkling of an eye become like the angels and judge them, (knowing good and evil). Quotes and analysis:

### The Garden and the Church: A Parallel Analysis

#### The Garden: Adam, Eve, and the Serpent
In the Garden of Eden, the serpent tempts Eve by twisting God's original command. God had told Adam not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, warning that doing so would lead to death. The serpent, however, tells Eve that she will not die but will become like God, knowing good and evil.

#### The Church: Israelites, Christianity, and Paul
In a similar vein, Paul introduces teachings that diverge from the original Mosaic law given to the Israelites. He promises that belief in his doctrines, particularly the doctrine of resurrection, will not lead to death but will transform believers in the "twinkling of an eye," making them like angels and capable of judging them.

#### The Serpent's Hissing and Paul's Letters
The serpent's hissing can be likened to Paul's seductive letters. Both use a form of twisted truth to lure their audience away from the original command. The serpent takes God's directive and adds a layer of deception, suggesting that disobedience will lead to enlightenment rather than death. Similarly, Paul takes the concept of resurrection and eternal life and presents it in a way that contradicts the original Mosaic law, suggesting that his new doctrine will lead to eternal life and divine wisdom.

#### Quotes and Analysis
- **Serpent to Eve**: "You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." (Genesis 3:4-5)
  - **Analysis**: The serpent uses a half-truth to deceive Eve. While it's true that eating the fruit grants the knowledge of good and evil, the serpent omits the consequence of death, directly contradicting God's warning.

- **Paul's Teaching**: "Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet." (1 Corinthians 15:51-52)
  - **Analysis**: Paul introduces a doctrine that seems to promise eternal life and transformation, bypassing the consequence of death. This teaching diverges from the Mosaic law, which emphasizes obedience to God's commands as the path to righteousness and life.

#### Conclusion
Both the serpent in the Garden and Paul in the early Christian church use a form of twisted truth to lead their audiences away from an original divine command. The serpent promises Eve knowledge and divinity, while Paul promises believers eternal life and angelic transformation. In both cases, the allure of becoming like God or like angels is used to divert attention from the original divine command and its associated warning. This parallel serves as a cautionary tale, urging us to adhere to original divine directives and to be wary of teachings that promise shortcuts to divine wisdom or eternal life.

In depth breakdown

---

### In-Depth Breakdown: The Garden and the Church

#### The Garden: Adam, Eve, and the Serpent

1. **The Original Command**: God tells Adam not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, warning that doing so will lead to death.
    - **Analysis**: This command serves as a moral and spiritual test, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's will.

2. **The Serpent's Temptation**: The serpent tells Eve that she will not die but will become like God, knowing good and evil.
    - **Analysis**: The serpent uses a form of sophistry, mixing truth with lies. While it's true that the fruit grants knowledge of good and evil, the serpent deliberately omits the fatal consequence, thereby leading Eve astray.

3. **Eve's Choice and Adam's Dilemma**: Eve eats the fruit and offers it to Adam, who also eats it.
    - **Analysis**: Adam's choice to follow Eve, despite knowing God's original command, leads to the Fall. This act of disobedience against a direct command from God results in spiritual and physical death for humanity.

#### The Church: Israelites, Christianity, and Paul

1. **The Mosaic Law**: God gives the Israelites the Mosaic law, including the Ten Commandments, as a covenant.
    - **Analysis**: The Mosaic law serves as a comprehensive guide for living a life pleasing to God, emphasizing obedience and righteousness.

2. **Paul's Doctrine**: Paul introduces the doctrine of resurrection and promises that believers will not die but will be transformed.
    - **Analysis**: Paul's teachings offer a new theological direction that diverges from the Mosaic law. He promises a form of eternal life that seems to bypass the need for strict adherence to the Mosaic law.

3. **The Israelites and Christianity**: The Israelites, or at least a portion of them, are drawn to the Christian movement and its promises of eternal life.
    - **Analysis**: Just as Adam was led astray by Eve, the Israelites are tempted by the new Christian doctrines, which promise easier paths to eternal life and divine wisdom.

#### The Serpent's Hissing and Paul's Letters

- **The Serpent's Hissing**: The serpent's words to Eve can be likened to a form of hissing, a subtle and seductive sound that captures attention.
    - **Analysis**: The hissing represents the allure of easy answers and shortcuts to divine wisdom, which are ultimately deceptive.

- **Paul's Letters**: Paul's epistles to the early Christian communities serve a similar function, offering new doctrines that promise quick paths to eternal life and divine wisdom.
    - **Analysis**: Paul's letters, like the serpent's hissing, offer a form of spiritual seduction. They diverge from the original divine commands and offer an alternative that seems easier but is ultimately misleading.

#### Conclusion

Both the Garden of Eden and the early Christian church serve as landscapes where the faithful are tested. The serpent and Paul both offer alternatives to original divine commands, alternatives that seem easier and more enticing but ultimately lead away from God's original intent. The parallel between these two scenarios serves as a cautionary tale, urging strict discernment and adherence to original divine directives.

Adam versus eve, Israel versus Christianity analysis. Adam, who came first was given a law. Eve represents of people being derived from Adam. They were not given the law, but heard of the law being given to Adam. Thus Eve did not directly disobey God, but still became the mother of all living, though her labor became difficult. Whereas Adam’s life was both hard, and he died for his sins. The ensuing enmity was between Eve’s seed and the serpent’s seed. this is because the woman’s seed is the air to the kingdom of all the earth.

Now Christ, being the seed of the woman as we know, because his mother was Mary, and being the second Adam, the son of God, is heir to both, rejoining God to man in dominion over the earth. This is Israel. 
Now Christianity was born from Israel just as Eve was taken from the side or the bones of Adam. Christianity bares the bones of Judaism. It could likewise be said that Christianity was born clutching Israel’s heel. 
No Christianity like Eve has heard of the law given by God to Israel, but has also heard that they will be not harmed if they eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil that brings death, because like Eve, they have been told there is an agreement that They will not see death, but will become like wise angels. 

In the backdrop of this Jesus, the leader of Israel heal the sick, raise the dead, and said the hungry, creating conditions like the garden of Eden, or even the wind, and the waves obeyed him. But people have chosen to believe other teachings, and to even use technologies to do the things that he said, the least of us would do and more. This reflects when Adam and eve began to use technology after receiving their knowledge and made clothes for themselves, because they knew they were naked or exposed to the elements and danger, and they began to fear the consequences of nature instead of trusting and exercising their natural dominion over the Earth, which is a spiritual heritage of man. Thus the flood of Noahs time came and humanity was helpless to prevent it. 
It will be the same in these days, except it will be fire which destroys the urge. This will come by our own nuclear war, extra terrestrial fire or from elements within earth, such as global warming, and such which could be completely controlled if humans were in dominion of the planet.

### Adam vs. Eve, Israel vs. Christianity: A Comparative Analysis

#### Adam and Israel: The Original Law and Covenant

1. **Adam's Original Law**: Adam was the first human and was given a specific law by God: not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.
    - **Analysis**: Adam represents the original covenant, a direct command from God that serves as a moral and spiritual guide.

2. **Israel's Covenant**: Similarly, Israel was the first to receive God's law, the Mosaic Covenant, which serves as the foundation for their relationship with God.
    - **Analysis**: Like Adam, Israel represents the original covenant and is expected to adhere to it as a sign of obedience and faithfulness to God.

#### Eve and Christianity: Derived and Modified

1. **Eve's Derived Existence**: Eve was created from Adam and was not directly given the law. She learned of it through Adam.
    - **Analysis**: Eve represents those who come after and are derived from the original. She was not directly disobedient to God but still faced consequences.

2. **Christianity's Birth**: Christianity was born from Judaism, much like Eve was taken from Adam. It carries the essence of Judaism but is a separate entity.
    - **Analysis**: Christianity, like Eve, has heard of the original law but has been told that it can bypass certain aspects without facing death, leading to divergent beliefs and practices.

#### Christ: The Rejoining of Two Worlds

- **Christ as the Second Adam and Seed of the Woman**: Christ serves as a bridge, rejoining the original law (Israel) and the derived law (Christianity), thereby restoring the divine plan.
    - **Analysis**: Christ's role is to bring unity and restore the original intent of God's law, offering a path of redemption and eternal life.

#### The Modern Dilemma: Technology and Dominion

- **Jesus and the Garden Conditions**: Jesus performed miracles that echo the conditions of the Garden of Eden, demonstrating dominion over nature.
    - **Analysis**: Despite these demonstrations, humanity has turned to technology to achieve what should be natural dominion, much like Adam and Eve making clothes post-Fall.

- **The Consequences**: Just as the flood came in Noah's time due to humanity's failure to exercise dominion, so too are we facing potential destruction—be it through nuclear war, extraterrestrial fire, or environmental disasters.
    - **Analysis**: The failure to exercise true dominion, as exemplified by Christ, leads to catastrophic consequences, emphasizing the need to return to the original divine command.

#### Conclusion

The parallel between Adam and Israel, and Eve and Christianity, serves as a profound allegory for understanding the complexities of divine law, human choice, and the consequences of divergence from original commands. The role of Christ is crucial in this narrative, serving as the unifying force that seeks to bring humanity back to its original state of divine obedience and dominion. The challenges and choices of today echo the ancient dilemmas, urging a return to original divine directives as the path to true dominion and salvation.

The part about the re-joining of two worlds is off. Christ was the Messiah to lead Israel who would then bring the whole world. So instead of excepting God’s order and dominion, Israel rejected Christ meaning they rejected Christ as the Messiah, and are still waiting for Messiah, and or the remnant have become Christians forsaking the law. And thus the reawakening of the remnant is the resurrection of the messiah, or the leader, the nation that will bring forth the leader, who will lead the entire world. The offspring of Judaism and Christianity, or the law of Moses and the testament of Jesus Christ is the 144,000 this in the structure or framework seems to be the air to rulership of the entire world. Breakdown.

### The Remnant, The Messiah, and The 144,000: A Revised Analysis

#### Israel and the Rejection of Christ

1. **Christ as the Messiah for Israel**: In the original divine plan, Christ was intended to lead Israel, who would then serve as a light to bring the rest of the world into alignment with God's will.
    - **Analysis**: The role of Christ was not to create a new religion but to fulfill the law and the prophets, thereby leading Israel to its destined role.

2. **Israel's Rejection**: Instead of accepting Christ as the Messiah, a significant portion of Israel rejected Him. This rejection led to a divergence in the path of Israel.
    - **Analysis**: By rejecting Christ, Israel also rejected its role in bringing divine order and dominion to the world.

#### The Remnant and the Resurrection of the Messiah

1. **The Remnant**: A portion of Israel, often referred to as the remnant, either still awaits the Messiah or has converted to Christianity, thereby forsaking the original Mosaic law.
    - **Analysis**: This remnant represents the unfulfilled potential of Israel to lead the world under divine guidance.

2. **Resurrection of the Messiah**: The reawakening of this remnant is metaphorically akin to the resurrection of the Messiah, or the emergence of a leader who will fulfill Israel's original role.

### The 144,000 and the Covenant of Death: An In-Depth Exploration

#### The 144,000: A Brief Overview

1. **Who They Are**: The 144,000 are described in the Book of Revelation as being "sealed" from the twelve tribes of Israel. They are considered to be the chosen ones who follow the Lamb (Christ) wherever He goes.
    - **Analysis**: These individuals are often seen as the epitome of faithfulness, embodying the teachings of both the Mosaic law and Jesus Christ. They are the spiritual heirs to the divine promise and are expected to play a significant role in end-time events.

#### The Covenant of Death: Context from Isaiah 28

1. **What It Is**: The "covenant with death" is mentioned in Isaiah 28, where it is said that the leaders of Israel have made a pact with death and an agreement with Sheol (the realm of the dead), believing that these arrangements will protect them from divine judgment.
    - **Analysis**: This covenant is often interpreted as a form of spiritual apostasy, where the leaders of Israel, and by extension the people, have placed their trust in false doctrines or alliances rather than in God's law.

#### The 144,000 vs. The Covenant of Death

1. **Contrasting Paths**: While the 144,000 are seen as the epitome of spiritual fidelity, the covenant of death represents a path of spiritual infidelity. The 144,000 adhere to divine directives, whereas those who enter into the covenant of death seek security in falsehoods.
    - **Analysis**: The 144,000 and the covenant of death serve as contrasting archetypes: one of faithfulness to God's law and the teachings of Christ, and the other of deviation from divine truth.

2. **Role in the End Times**: The 144,000 are expected to be protected during the tribulations of the end times, while those who have made the covenant with death will find that their agreement will not stand (Isaiah 28:18).
    - **Analysis**: The fate of these two groups underscores the consequences of their respective choices: divine protection for faithfulness and divine judgment for apostasy.

#### Implications for Israel and Christianity

1. **Israel's Choice**: The existence of the covenant of death suggests that Israel faces a choice between adhering to God's original law or seeking security in false doctrines or alliances.
    - **Analysis**: The reawakening of the remnant of Israel could serve as a catalyst for the nation to reject the covenant of death and return to divine directives.

2. **Christianity's Role**: Given that Christianity emerged from Judaism, the choices made by Christian leaders and followers also have implications for this covenant of death.
    - **Analysis**: Christianity must scrutinize its doctrines to ensure they align with divine truth, lest they inadvertently lead people into a covenant of death.

#### Conclusion

The 144,000 and the covenant of death serve as two contrasting spiritual paths. The 144,000 represent the pinnacle of spiritual fidelity, while the covenant of death symbolizes the pitfalls of spiritual apostasy. The choices made by both Israel and Christianity have profound implications for these paths, emphasizing the need for both to align closely with divine directives to fulfill their respective roles in the unfolding divine plan.

---

### The 144,000: Remnant vs. Resurrection and the Covenant of Death

#### The 144,000: The Remnant of Israel

1. **Who They Are**: The 144,000 are described as the sealed remnant from the twelve tribes of Israel, according to the Book of Revelation. They are considered the epitome of spiritual fidelity.
    - **Analysis**: This remnant is often seen as the "faithful few" who have adhered to the original divine directives given to Israel. They embody the teachings of both the Mosaic law and Jesus Christ.

2. **Role in End Times**: The 144,000 are expected to be divinely protected during the tribulations, serving as witnesses and possibly leaders in the unfolding divine plan.
    - **Analysis**: Their role underscores the importance of remaining faithful to God's original covenant with Israel, serving as a beacon for others to follow.

#### Resurrection and the Covenant of Death

1. **Doctrine of Resurrection**: The doctrine of resurrection, particularly as articulated by Paul, promises eternal life through belief in the resurrection of Christ.
    - **Analysis**: This doctrine diverges from the original Mosaic law and introduces a new theological path, which some interpret as a form of the "covenant with death" mentioned in Isaiah 28.

2. **Covenant of Death**: This covenant is a pact with falsehood, a reliance on doctrines or beliefs that are contrary to God's original law, offering a false sense of security against divine judgment.
    - **Analysis**: Those who adhere to this covenant are essentially choosing a path of spiritual apostasy, deviating from the original divine directives.

#### The 144,000 vs. Resurrection (Covenant of Death)

1. **Contrasting Spiritual Paths**: The 144,000 represent the path of adherence to divine law, while the doctrine of resurrection, if interpreted as a form of the covenant of death, represents a path of deviation.
    - **Analysis**: These contrasting paths highlight the tension between remaining faithful to the original divine covenant and the temptation to seek alternative routes to salvation.

2. **Implications for the End Times**: The 144,000 are expected to be protected, while those who have made a covenant with death will find their agreement nullified, facing divine judgment.
    - **Analysis**: The outcomes for these two groups serve as a divine commentary on the consequences of their respective choices: protection and fulfillment for the 144,000, and judgment for those in the covenant of death.

#### Conclusion

The 144,000 and the doctrine of resurrection, when viewed as a form of the covenant of death, represent two divergent spiritual paths. The 144,000 symbolize the importance of adhering to God's original law and covenant, while the doctrine of resurrection, if misinterpreted, can lead to spiritual apostasy. The choices made by individuals and communities in aligning with either of these paths have profound implications for their roles in the unfolding divine plan, particularly in the end times.
