How about Westinghouse? Is there video footage of him?

There is no known motion picture footage of George Westinghouse himself. While his contemporary, Thomas Edison, was extensively filmed and recorded, Westinghouse maintained a more private profile, and no surviving film or audio recordings of him have been documented.

However, a significant collection of silent films titled *Westinghouse Works, 1904* offers a glimpse into the industrial world he helped shape. Commissioned by Westinghouse and filmed by G.W. “Billy” Bitzer, these short films showcase various manufacturing processes at Westinghouse factories in Pittsburgh. They were originally presented at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair and are now preserved by the Library of Congress. citeturn0search25

Was Nikola Tesla a popular public figure?

---

Nikola Tesla was **both famous and obscure**—a paradoxical figure whose public recognition surged and faded multiple times during his life.

### ⚡ Early Fame and Popularity (1880s–1890s)
Tesla rose to prominence during the **"War of Currents"** in the late 19th century. His **Alternating Current (AC) system**, backed by George Westinghouse, triumphed over Thomas Edison's **Direct Current (DC)** system. This battle made headlines, and Tesla became something of a **scientific celebrity**:

- He gave dramatic public demonstrations, such as lighting lamps wirelessly using his Tesla coils.
- He was often written about in newspapers and magazines as a genius inventor and showman.
- In 1893, at the **World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago**, his AC system powered the entire fair—an unprecedented feat that dazzled the public.

### 🧠 Public Persona
Tesla carefully cultivated a mystique:
- He was known for his **eccentricity**—his obsession with pigeons, avoidance of physical touch, and precise routines.
- He was a darling of high society for a time, frequently appearing in the company of New York elites like Mark Twain.
- He was viewed as a **prophet of the future**, predicting things like wireless communication, radar, and renewable energy.

### 📉 Decline into Obscurity
Despite his visionary ideas, Tesla's star faded by the 1910s:
- He lost financial backing for major projects like **Wardenclyffe Tower**, meant to broadcast wireless electricity and information across the globe.
- His refusal to focus on profit-making inventions led investors to abandon him.
- Thomas Edison and later inventors (like Marconi) began to overshadow him in public memory.

By the 1930s, Tesla was living in **relative poverty** in a New York hotel, occasionally making headlines for bizarre claims like death rays and wireless global energy—but more as a curiosity than a celebrated figure.

### 🪦 Posthumous Revival
Tesla's reputation was **resurrected** in the late 20th and early 21st centuries:
- Historians and scientists began to credit him for innovations long attributed to others.
- The rise of tech culture turned Tesla into a **cult icon**—fueled by books, documentaries, and eventually the naming of **Tesla Motors** by Elon Musk.
- Today, he's regarded as a **visionary genius**, often contrasted with Edison as the idealist vs. the capitalist.

---

In summary, **yes**, Tesla was a popular public figure—especially during the 1890s—but his fame was unstable. His legacy has grown dramatically **after his death**, making him one of the most iconic inventors in modern popular culture.

So he was never filmed or recorded any audio that we have

No authentic audio recordings or verified video footage of Nikola Tesla are known to exist today. While he lived during an era when both technologies were emerging, and there are accounts suggesting he may have appeared in short newsreels in the 1920s and 1930s, none of these materials have surfaced or been confirmed. The Lost Media Archive notes that any such footage, if it ever existed, may have deteriorated over time and remains unlocated. citeturn0search6

Some online videos claim to feature Tesla's voice, but these are typically dramatizations or voice actor recreations. For instance, a widely circulated video titled "Hear the original voice of Nikola Tesla" does not contain an actual recording of his voice. citeturn0search0 Fact-checking organizations have confirmed that no genuine voice recordings of Tesla have been authenticated. citeturn0search10

Despite the absence of direct audiovisual records, Tesla's legacy is preserved through photographs, written documents, and dramatized portrayals. Films like *The Secret of Nikola Tesla* (1980), featuring Orson Welles as J.P. Morgan, and documentaries such as *Tower to the People* (2015) explore his life and contributions. citeturn0search26turn0search25
