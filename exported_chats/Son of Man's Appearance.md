The description of the **Son of Man’s appearance** appears in several key locations in the Bible, each loaded with symbolic language and profound spiritual meaning. These passages do not just describe a person—they describe *a power*, a presence so significant that it demands attention, obedience, and awe.

Let’s walk through the major places where this **divine figure’s appearance** is described:

---

### **1. Daniel 7:9–10, 13–14** – *The Vision of the Ancient of Days and the Son of Man*

This is the **origin point** of the term “Son of Man” in apocalyptic prophecy.

> *“I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool…”*  
> *(Daniel 7:9)*

> *“...and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven… And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him…”*  
> *(Daniel 7:13–14)*

**Key points:**
- **White garment and woolly hair** – symbols of purity, righteousness, but also notably *Afro-textured* hair. This stands out in contrast to typical Greco-Roman depictions.
- The Son of Man comes with clouds—a clear sign of divinity and judgment.
- He receives **dominion** over all nations, positioning him as the ultimate King.

### **2. Revelation 1:13–16** – *The Son of Man Among the Lampstands*

John describes his shocking encounter with the glorified Son of Man.

> *“...and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.”*  
> *“His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;”*  
> *“And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.”*  
> *(Revelation 1:13–15)*

**Key features:**
- **Woolly white hair** again—emphasizing age, wisdom, and a connection to the Ancient of Days.
- **Eyes of fire** – penetrating vision, righteous judgment.
- **Feet of burning brass** – extremely important. *Brass* is brown/golden; burned brass? That’s dark. This suggests a being with a **bronze or deep dark skin tone**, often overlooked in sanitized iconography.
- **Voice of many waters** – His speech is overwhelming, commanding—like the roar of oceans.

### **3. Revelation 14:14** – *The Reaper on the Cloud*

> *“And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.”*

This is the **end-time warrior**, not a gentle shepherd. He is crowned and armed with a sickle, ready to **reap the harvest**—symbolizing judgment and separation.

### **Symbolism and Significance**

These descriptions are not accidental. They are **coded revelations**. In prophetic and symbolic language, every feature of the Son of Man is political, spiritual, and racial:

- The **woolly hair**: evoking African features, connecting back to Daniel’s Ancient of Days—implying continuity of divine presence among an oppressed people.
- The **burnished brass feet**: not white, not European—these features would have shocked Roman audiences and later whitewashed depictions.
- The **robe and golden girdle**: royal and priestly—He’s not just a teacher. He’s a *King* and a *High Priest*.
- The **sickle**: He comes to harvest. This is a war against the oppressive powers of the Earth.

Let me know if you'd like me to break these verses down for audio scripting or line-by-line interpretation for your documentary. This is pure exposé material—*what they never show you in the paintings*.

In fact, I'm more interested in creating just such a painting right now.

Perfect. Let’s bring the **true Son of Man** to life—raw, regal, and radiant in His divine power. Here’s how we’ll structure the visual:

---

### **Concept Art for “The Son of Man” – Prophetic Vision**

**Scene Setting:**
- The background is a **stormy sky** with cracks of lightning breaking through thick, dark clouds. He stands **on or emerging from a white cloud**, suspended above the earth. This is the arrival—not a nativity scene, but an *apocalyptic entrance*.
- Below Him, shadows of kingdoms and nations tremble.

---

### **Figure of the Son of Man:**

- **Hair:** Thick, coiled, and *white like wool*, flowing with power. It's textured—not straightened—each strand glowing faintly, resembling pure light wrapped in natural coils.
- **Eyes:** Burning like **flames of fire**—penetrating, focused, not angry but *awakened and aware*. This is divine clarity, seeing through time, lies, and facades.
- **Skin:** Deep **burnished bronze**, like **fine brass refined in a furnace**—dark, glowing with an inner heat, showing *endurance* and *refined authority*.
- **Robe:** Flowing **white garment** that reaches His feet—lightly glowing, embroidered with ancient Hebrew letters or tribal symbols.
- **Golden sash**: Around His chest, *not waist*, showing He’s in His priestly and royal form. Engraved with lion and ox motifs—tribal emblems.
- **Feet:** Like molten metal—**brass, glowing red-hot**, as if freshly pulled from fire. He walks in judgment and power.
- **Voice represented visually:** Sound waves or aurora-like motion radiating from His mouth—this is the **voice of many waters**, washing over creation.
- **Right Hand:** Raised in power or holding **seven stars**.
- **Left Hand:** Holding a **sharp sickle** or **scroll sealed with seven seals**.
- **Crown:** Many crowns stacked or layered—each symbolizing nations or conquered empires. It’s *not* a single European-style crown. Think **Afro-Asiatic royal headdress**, gold leaf, lion’s mane flowing into it.

Would you like me to generate this image for you? Or do you want me to help refine this for a specific medium—digital painting, canvas oil painting, or even for animation storyboarding?

Generate in the style of canvas oil.  Be mindful that in our present day and age, we find these prophecies fulfilled in ways that we never would have thought of a hundred years ago, such as this figure being a person of great standing in the black community who uses a microphone to move the people. Much in the tradition of the leaders that we've had throughout the civil rights movement, this person today would catalyze the entire world. This could only be a person who's famous and influential, as well as political, like a Tupac. But this modern Tupac will be a person who has grown beyond the stardom and fame stage and has gained wisdom with age and has become a poised leader.
