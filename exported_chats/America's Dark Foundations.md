# America's Dark Foundations



---

Look at the news, look at all the sex scandals. Look at all the most successful people among the most powerful people being the most criminally minded when it comes to the regular normalization of sexual enterprises, sexual deviants, pit-coast, covert, career-assassinating, sexual deviancies. Well, you see guys like country, Jeff Epstein, they are accused of and involved in things that they say are like a RICO, violation of RICO, criminal enterprises. Well, what do we expect in a nation that was founded on the very thing that they accuse these men of? Trafficking slaves, sex crimes, rampant abuse of slaves as a criminal enterprise, as an enterprise which allowed crime to go rampant beneath it and unpunished. Murder, sexual assault, rape of young boys, girls, women, and men. This is what the nation was built on and at that time it was even legal. There was no other enterprise or trade that really built America or the colonies except for trafficking young bodies. And so success still looks that way.

Look around—what do you see? Another scandal. Another so-called elite exposed. Another politician or billionaire tied to secret flights, closed-door parties, and career-shattering allegations. It's not just coincidence. It's the pattern. From Jeffrey Epstein to Hollywood’s elite, the most powerful in this country keep getting caught up in the same web: organized sexual exploitation—what prosecutors call racketeering, what the Bible calls abomination, and what history dares not confess.

But let’s pull back. Let’s go further than the tabloids. Why are we surprised? Why do we act shocked when these modern moguls and media darlings build their empires on the backs of young flesh? Isn’t that the very foundation of this nation?

The American economy wasn’t born in boardrooms. It was born on auction blocks. Children sold like cattle. Women violated with impunity. Men broken and paraded. This wasn’t fringe—it was the system. An organized, state-sanctioned, theologically justified trafficking enterprise. The law supported it. The church blessed it. The banks insured it. It was the business model.

You want to talk about RICO? America is the original crime family. And success in America has always looked like exploitation dressed in civility. The plantation became the corporation. The overseer became the CEO. The breeding farms became “networking events.” And the whips were swapped for NDAs.

They say Epstein ran a ring. But wasn’t the transatlantic slave trade a ring? A global enterprise built around trafficking the vulnerable. They say he used power to silence victims. So did the Founding Fathers. They didn’t just legalize the abuse—they institutionalized it. The nation was baptized in it. So what do we expect?

The truth is this: success in America has always been soaked in blood and scented with perfume. And the deeper you go into the halls of power, the more it smells like the old plantations.
