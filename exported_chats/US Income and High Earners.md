In the United States, individual incomes vary widely, with median and average figures providing insight into the overall distribution. As of 2023, the median individual income was approximately $50,000, meaning half of individuals earned less than this amount, and half earned more. The average individual income was about $69,030, a higher figure influenced by top earners. citeturn0search7

High earners are often defined by their position within income percentiles. For instance, to be in the top 10% of earners, an individual would need an income exceeding $129,181. The threshold for the top 5% is approximately $173,176, and for the top 1%, it's around $401,622. citeturn0search23
