# Faith and Action



---



---

On faith, Paul talks about the power of faith and being saved by faith. The book of Hebrews also talks about faith and what great faith the patriots achieved. Jesus also talks about faith and he says that through faith people were healed. Through faith, people were able to see. The blind were able to see. But then when it came to people with little faith, they were not able to do so. You see, that's the thing about faith. It's usually only the desperate who have it and have enough faith. It's the ones who have no other options and are desperate to believe. They believe with everything in them because they want it so badly, right? They don't have anything else. They're losing a child. Something is happening. They've been in this condition for so many years and Jesus tells them, your faith has made you whole. Or according to your faith, is it done? And so we see that faith is a thing that is fickle. The disciples couldn't heal because he said they didn't have, their faith was weak. And so when Jesus says, all these people will believe and say, Lord, Lord, he's going to say, depart from me, you workers of iniquity, I never knew you. Well, why hasn't their faith achieved what they wanted? Why haven't they done the works that Jesus wanted? Why haven't they known him? Well, it's because their faith is small. They have little faith. See, Paul is called small. They have faith as Paul taught them to have faith. Faith that has no action. Faith that's not acted on. Faith that's just a hope. Hope is not faith. Hoping is hoping. It's passive. The faith that Paul is talking about is passive. But the faith that any of those patriarchs had in common, all had this factor in common. They didn't require a man to die for them in order for them to be accepted by God. They had faith and God was pleased with them. None of them needed a man to die for him. You see, because anyone who needs a man, an innocent man to die for them so that they'll be saved proves how weak their faith is right there. They prove how weak their faith is right there. That's the opposite of what Abraham did. He knew that God would not let an innocent person die. See, he had faith in God's word. He knew that God would not let an innocent person die and that he would send a replacement. God would provide himself a lamb, a ram. You see, that's faith in God. You know that God's going to act as you're acting in accordance to his commands. And so faith is keeping the commands even when there's peril, even when people say there's an easier way. Faith is keeping the commands no matter what temptation comes. When people offer you something, Abraham says, I won't touch anything because I've sworn to the Lord God. That's faith. Faith is not accepting what's offered for free. You see, they're offering something of reward when God has already promised you a reward. God is the reward. And so these people that don't believe in God's reward, they don't have faith in what God promised through his word. And so they needed something else. They need something else to happen outside of them. And they'll just believe that that'll happen without acting on it. Oh, ye of little faith. If they had true faith, they could move mountains. But instead, they can't even remove the stone in their heart.

This is a powerful reflection on the true nature of **faith**—its substance, its source, and its failure when corrupted by passive belief systems. Let's distill and frame your insights with biblical precision and historical context, particularly comparing the teachings of Jesus, the patriarchs, and Paul.

---

## 🔥 **Faith: The Active Ingredient of Righteousness**

### 1. **Faith Heals and Reveals**
Throughout the Gospels, **Jesus connects faith to action and results**:

> **"Your faith has made you whole."** (Mark 5:34, Luke 8:48)  
> **"According to your faith be it unto you."** (Matthew 9:29)  
> **"If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, 'Move,' and it shall move."** (Matthew 17:20)

These aren’t abstract hopes. The people who received healing:
- *Approached* Jesus in desperation.
- *Spoke* or *touched* in boldness.
- *Believed* actively, sometimes even violating social norms or purity laws to reach him.

Their **faith worked through deeds**—a complete contrast to those Jesus rebuked for **“little faith”** or **no action**.

> **"Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?"** (Matthew 8:26)  
> **"O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?"** (Matthew 17:17)

Faith, as taught by Jesus, isn’t intellectual consent—it’s *movement toward the promise*.

---

### 2. **Faith of the Patriarchs: No Man Died for Them**
> **“By faith Abraham… obeyed.”** (Hebrews 11:8)  
> **“By faith Moses… chose to suffer affliction with the people of God.”** (Hebrews 11:24–25)

The **faith of the patriarchs** was not:
- Believing a blood sacrifice would do it for them.
- Trusting in a substitutionary death.

Instead:
- **Abraham believed God** when told to leave everything (Genesis 12).
- He believed God **would not accept the death of Isaac**, even when asked to sacrifice him (Genesis 22).

> “**God will provide Himself a lamb**” (Genesis 22:8) – this is not a promise of *someone else dying for sin*, but a **substitution in righteousness**—*not blood for guilt*, but *life for obedience*.

The patriarchs' faith was:
- **Covenantal**, not vicarious.
- Rooted in **obedience**, not death.
- Focused on **God’s word and promise**, not man’s offering.

---

### 3. **Paul’s Faith: Passive, Hope-Based, and Substitutionary**
Paul’s definition of faith is:

> **“A man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.”** (Romans 3:28)  
> **“To him that worketh not, but believeth… his faith is counted for righteousness.”** (Romans 4:5)

This introduces:
- A **passive faith**: "worketh not."
- A **disembodied hope**: detached from commandment-keeping.
- A **legal substitution**: “Christ died for the ungodly.” (Romans 5:6)

Such faith:
- Doesn’t demand obedience.
- Doesn’t require visible fruit.
- **Relies on a man’s death** for justification—*something no patriarch ever needed.*

This is why you say:  
> *“Faith that requires a man to die proves how weak it is.”*  
Indeed, it’s not the faith of Abraham. It’s not the faith Jesus required. It’s the **faith of Paul**, whose name literally means “small.”

---

### 4. **True Faith: Enduring Without Shortcuts**
> **“Abraham said… I will not take a thread nor a shoelatchet… lest you should say, ‘I made Abram rich.’”** (Genesis 14:23)

This is *faith in God's reward*, not the reward of men. True faith:
- Endures **poverty** to uphold integrity.
- Resists **bribes and shortcuts**.
- Keeps God's commands **under pressure** (Daniel 3:18, Hebrews 11:35–38).

> **"Without faith it is impossible to please God."** (Hebrews 11:6)  
But what kind of faith?
> The kind that **believes God will reward those who diligently seek Him.** Not those who passively accept a death in their place.

---

## 🪨 **"Why Can’t They Move Mountains?"**
Because:
- They believe in a doctrine **without obedience**.
- They hope in a promise **without covenant**.
- They rely on death **instead of life**.

Jesus said:
> **“Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter… but he who does the will of my Father.”** (Matthew 7:21)

**Faith without action is dead.**  
> “Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.” (James 2:17)

They cry “Lord,” but they **do not know** Him. Why?

> “He that says, ‘I know him,’ and keeps not his commandments, is a liar.” (1 John 2:4)

---

## 🧱 Conclusion: The Stone They Can’t Move
> They cannot **remove the stone from their heart** because their faith is not the faith of the covenant.  
> They follow Paul’s doctrine of a dying savior—not Jesus' doctrine of a living obedience.

> **“This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.”** (Mark 7:6)

True faith:
- Acts.
- Obeys.
- Waits.
- Endures.

It does **not** rely on blood spilled to excuse disobedience.

> **“Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith.”** (Habakkuk 2:4)

And that faith… was *never* passive.

On this one, I'm looking for something a little more eloquent. How can we do that?

---

Absolutely—we can elevate this into something more eloquent while preserving your powerful contrast between **active covenantal faith** and **passive substitutionary belief**. Here's a revised version written in a more literary and refined narrative style, suitable for a script, essay, or voiceover:

## 📜 **Faith: The Measure of the Heart**

Faith, we are told, can move mountains. Yet how many who speak of faith remain unmoved themselves—unchanged, unyielding, unbroken before the word of God?

Paul speaks of faith as a means to justification, a kind of divine ledger wherein belief alone settles the account. But when Jesus speaks of faith, it is no quiet inner assent. It is not passive trust. It is not a legal transaction. It is **power in motion**.

> “Your faith has made you whole.”  
> “According to your faith, be it unto you.”  
> “O ye of little faith, why did you doubt?”

To Jesus, faith is **the force that reaches**—the woman pressing through the crowd, the centurion refusing to require proof, the blind men crying out despite rebuke. It is always the desperate who believe. Not because desperation is noble, but because it strips away every other hope. It leaves the soul naked, and from that place, true faith can rise.

The faith that Jesus honors is never idle. It risks. It cries out. It acts.  
It is the **faith of those with nothing left—but God**.

---

## 🏕️ **The Faith of the Fathers**

And what of Abraham? He was called righteous—*not* because he believed a man would die for him, but because he trusted that God would keep His word. When the knife was raised, Abraham believed not in death, but in **resurrection**. Not in sacrifice, but in substitution. He said:

> “God will provide Himself a lamb.”

Not a human scapegoat. Not an innocent slain to cover the guilty. Abraham's faith was in God's justice—that the Judge of all the earth would do right. That He would not demand the blood of the innocent, but would intervene to stop it.

That is the kind of faith that pleased God.

So too with Moses, who chose affliction over privilege. With Daniel, who refused to bow. With David, who would not take Saul’s life though it meant the throne. Their faith did not sit still. It walked. It climbed. It endured.

None of them—**none**—required the death of another to stand right before God.

---

## 🪞 **A Mirror for Modern Faith**

So why, then, do so many today build their hope upon the death of a man?  
Why must their salvation hang on a cross instead of a commandment?

Because their faith is not rooted in obedience. It is rooted in fear.

They say, *"Lord, Lord,"* but they do not know Him. For to know Him is to walk as He walked, to do as He did, to keep His Father's words. And so He will say to them:

> “Depart from me, you workers of iniquity; I never knew you.”

Their faith is not the faith that moves mountains. It is the faith that moves mouths.  
Not the faith that touches the hem of the garment, but the kind that folds its hands and waits for someone else to do the touching.

Paul, whose very name means “small,” offers a small faith—a faith that needs no obedience, no law, no enduring. A faith that believes without becoming.  
But the faith of Christ demands transformation.

---

## 🧱 **Why Can’t They Move the Stone?**

Because the mountain is not out there—it is **within**.  
It is the stone heart, the hardened soul that refuses to yield to God's word.

> *"If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed..."*  
> But they do not.

They have hope.  
They have doctrine.  
They have Paul.

But they do not have the faith of the woman who bled for twelve years.  
They do not have the faith of the blind who saw before they ever opened their eyes.  
They do not have the faith of Abraham, who walked away from every comfort to follow the voice of God.

True faith obeys when there is nothing left to gain.  
True faith believes when no substitute is offered.  
True faith says: *God is enough. His word is enough. His promises are enough.*

That is the faith that makes whole.  
That is the faith Jesus recognized.  
That is the faith Paul never taught.
