lets do the analysis of ezekiel 12 as a foreshadowing of the exile, and the exile as a parallel structure to the happenings after the atonement ritual. jesus (the prince) is smuggled out through a secret passage as Judas willingly offers himself as a sin offering to be crucified (hanged himself). Jesus and the others with their faces covered go escape into exile. Jerusalem falls. the remnant is scattered and ensnared into captivity. In the Babylon of america Jesus has died. He died on the cross (to them). they wewar crosses on their necks, idol worshipping. the remnant is punished. lets do a line by line analysis of ezekiel 12:8-15. son of man as a word choice draws jesus to mind (especially the book of John). Jesus as the ensign to all nations is relevant to the 'sign' language continually used. the covered face (secrecy- Isaiah 53:3 speaks of this clandestine escape as Judas the despised is left behind to suffere his fate, baring sins of the other disciples who also had scattered and left Jesus, but are not maligned), the net and snare (slavery- the decendants of christ and the Israelites with him are ensnared, going into captivity just as the son of Joseph must be born in slavery and rise to save the nations, so must the son of man), the scattering of the disciples,... pursuing them (the remnant) with the drawn sword. modern babylon, plagues

I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but it seems we've reached a limit with accessing the PDF content directly. However, I can still provide a detailed analysis based on the information you've provided and my existing knowledge.

**Ezekiel 12:8-15 Analysis:**

**Verse 8:** The morning after Ezekiel's enactment of the exile, God speaks to him. The phrase "son of man" is used frequently in Ezekiel, and it does indeed draw parallels to Jesus, especially in the Gospel of John.

**Verse 9:** The Israelites question Ezekiel about his actions, indicating their lack of understanding or perhaps their disbelief in the impending judgment.

**Verse 10:** Ezekiel is to tell them that his actions are a prophecy against the "prince" in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are there. The "prince" here refers to King Zedekiah. In the New Testament context, Jesus is often referred to as the "Prince of Peace," and there's a parallel with Jesus being the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity.

**Verse 11:** Ezekiel's actions are a sign for the Israelites. Just as he went into exile, so will they. The use of "sign" language is reminiscent of Jesus being a sign for all nations.

**Verse 12:** The prince (Zedekiah) will carry his belongings on his shoulder at dusk and leave. He will dig through the wall to escape, covering his face so he cannot see the land. The covered face can be seen as a symbol of secrecy, and as you mentioned, Isaiah 53:3 speaks of a figure who is despised and rejected, which can be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus' crucifixion.

**Verse 13:** God will spread His net over Zedekiah, and he will be caught in it. This imagery of a net is evocative of the idea of being ensnared or trapped, which can be paralleled with the concept of spiritual slavery or bondage.

**Verse 14:** All those with Zedekiah will be scattered, and God will draw His sword after them. The scattering can be seen as a dispersion or exile, and the drawn sword symbolizes judgment or pursuit.

**Verse 15:** The nations will know that the Israelites were exiled because of their sins. This acknowledgment by the nations is a testament to God's righteousness and justice.

Drawing parallels with the New Testament, the idea of Jesus (the prince) being smuggled out while Judas offers himself can be seen as a reflection of the ultimate sacrifice and the atonement for sins. The scattering of the disciples, the ensnaring into captivity, and the pursuit with a drawn sword can be seen as the challenges and persecutions faced by the early Christian church. The modern Babylon and the wearing of crosses as a form of idol worship can be interpreted as a deviation from the true teachings of Christ, leading to spiritual bondage.

In conclusion, Ezekiel 12:8-15 provides a vivid portrayal of the impending exile of the Israelites due to their sins. The parallels with the New Testament events and teachings offer a deeper understanding of God's plan for redemption and the challenges faced by those who follow Him. The chapter serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the hope that lies in repentance and faith.
