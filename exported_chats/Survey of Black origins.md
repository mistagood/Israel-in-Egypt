# Survey of Black origins



---



---



---

Let's survey black thought on the origins of black people in America. If we are not from Africa, then where are we from? How did we get here? Were we originally here? What do different groups say about this? I know that many say we're from Africa, but I know there are groups such as the Moors, and others who have different origin stories. So I want to do a survey. What do the Nation of Islam teachers say? What do the Moors say? What do the Hebrews say are different groups? So I need to get a really good picture. So that I can understand what the current understanding is, or at least what has been said. So basically we're reviewing.

Got it—here’s a tight survey of major currents in Black thought about origins in the Americas, what they claim about “where from / how here / were we already here,” plus representative sources.

# 1) Mainstream scholarship (history, archaeology, genetics)
**Core view.** The vast majority of Black Americans descend primarily from West and West-Central Africans brought by the trans-Atlantic slave trade (16th–19th c.), then expanded demographically **inside** the U.S. by natural increase; admixture with Europeans and smaller Native contributions followed.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** From West/West-Central Africa; transported on slave ships; not indigenous to the Americas in origin, though intermarriage with Native peoples occurred.  
**Representative evidence.** The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (36,000+ documented voyages); museum & archival syntheses; population genetics showing modal African and substantial European ancestry with low average Native ancestry in U.S. African Americans; U.S. slavery’s unusually high natural increase. citeturn1search0turn1search6turn1search2turn1search10turn1search1turn1search4turn1search8

# 2) Pan-Africanism & “Back to Africa” (Garveyite stream)
**Core view.** Black people in the Americas are one people of African descent; Africa is the spiritual and political homeland; return (literal or metaphorical) and global Black unity are aims.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** From Africa via the slave trade; here by forced migration; not aboriginal to the Americas.  
**Key voices/texts.** Marcus Garvey & UNIA, “African Fundamentalism,” Back-to-Africa program; continuing reassessments of Garvey’s legacy. citeturn0search4turn0search9turn0news56

---

# 3) Nation of Islam (NOI)
**Core view.** Black people are the **Original People**; narratives include the **Tribe of Shabazz** and the **Yakub** story (creation of whites); Islam restores true identity and sovereignty.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** Framed cosmically rather than by ship manifests: the “Asiatic Black man” is primordial; American presence is part of a fall and rise story, not chiefly an origin in the Americas.  
**Texts/teachings.** *Message to the Blackman*; Yakub and Shabazz teachings; NOI institutional literature. citeturn0search5turn0search0

---

# 4) Five Percent Nation (Nation of Gods & Earths)
**Core view.** Offshoot of NOI; the Black man is God, the Black woman Earth; “Asiatic Blackman” as original humanity; Supreme Mathematics/Alphabet guide knowledge of self.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** Like NOI, places Blackness as **primordial**; American residence is a chapter in a cosmic-historical arc.  
**Sources.** Overviews of beliefs and history; doctrinal summaries. citeturn2search0turn2search6

---

# 5) Moorish Science Temple of America (MSTA) & Moorish-sovereign offshoots
**Core view (MSTA).** African Americans are **Moorish Americans**, descendants of Moabites/Moroccans; reclaiming Moorish nationality heals identity.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** “Moorish” identity links to North Africa and a broader “Asiatic” frame; some strands emphasize continuous Moorish presence in the Americas.  
**Offshoots.** “Moorish sovereign citizen” variants fuse MSTA language with pseudo-legal sovereignty claims (e.g., Washitaw).  
**Sources.** MSTA history and self-description; scholarly/monitoring analyses of sovereign-citizen offshoots. citeturn0search1turn0search6turn3search10turn3search1turn3search4

---

# 6) Hebrew Israelite movements (diverse camps)
**Core view.** Many African Americans are Israelites (often Ephraim/Judah lineages); the Middle Passage is read as fulfillment of Deut 28; call for Torah observance and identity restoration.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** From Israel (ancient dispersion) → Africa → Americas by enslavement; not aboriginal to the Americas, but part of Israel’s diaspora. Some groups have pursued life in Israel (e.g., Dimona community).  
**Sources.** Academic overviews; case studies such as the African Hebrew Israelites in Israel. citeturn0search2turn0search7

---

# 7) Rastafari
**Core view.** Ethiopia (Zion) is the spiritual homeland; Haile Selassie I linked to Davidic/Solomonic line; repatriation/return to Ethiopia carries theological weight.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** From Africa (Ethiopia as origin/destiny); present in Americas due to enslavement/colonial history; not aboriginal here.  
**Sources.** Reference syntheses and current reporting on communities (Ethiopia, Kenya). citeturn0search8turn0search3turn0news55turn0news54

---

# 8) Afro-Indigenous / “Black Indians” (history of overlap)
**Core view.** Significant communities have **dual** African-Native ancestry through intermarriage, shared settlement, and captivity on both sides; contemporary fights over **Freedmen** citizenship show the legacy.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** Mixed answers: African descent via slavery; some lineages are **also** Indigenous to the Americas through Native ancestry; emphasizes **entanglement** more than a single origin.  
**Evidence.** Smithsonian’s *IndiVisible* project; court/treaty history on Freedmen (e.g., Cherokee, Muscogee recent rulings). citeturn4search2turn4search0turn4search7turn4news23turn4news28

---

# 9) “Aboriginal Black American” claims (minority counter-narratives)
**Core view.** Some argue most Black Americans are **indigenous** to the Americas and were mislabeled as “African” (often invoking “paper genocide,” reclassification statutes, and Olmec iconography).  
**Where from / how here / already here?** Already here; “Africa-origin” is said to be an error or conspiracy.  
**Status in scholarship.** The **paper-genocide** reality (e.g., Virginia’s 1924 Racial Integrity Act) did reclassify many **Native** people as “colored,” but historians and genetics do **not** support the claim that most Black Americans are indigenous rather than African-descended. citeturn4search18

---

# 10) Afrocentric Egyptocentrism (Kemetist currents)
**Core view.** Centers Nile Valley as cradle of Black civilization; some read Black Americans’ identity primarily through Egypt/Kemet rather than West Africa.  
**Where from / how here / already here?** Civilizationally “from” Africa via Kemet; in the Americas through slavery/dispersion; not aboriginal here.  
**Sources.** Cheikh Anta Diop’s thesis and its reception; works/popularizations by Yosef ben-Jochannan; institutional reflections (e.g., The Met exhibit tying Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa). citeturn3search9turn3search18turn3search26turn3search21

## Where these views converge and diverge (quick map)

- **Convergence:** Most currents (Pan-Africanist, Hebrew Israelite, Rastafari, Afrocentric) still anchor Black Americans’ **deep origin in Africa** and explain American presence by **enslavement/dispersion**—they differ on *which* Africa (Ethiopia, Israel-in-Africa, Kemet) and on covenantal vs political framings. citeturn0search8turn0search2turn3search9  
- **Entanglement:** Documented **Afro-Native** intermarriage and treaty-era “Freedmen” lineages complicate a single-origin story and are legally alive issues right now (e.g., Muscogee, Cherokee). citeturn4search2turn4news23  
- **Divergence:** A smaller “Aboriginal Black American” stream asserts indigenous-American origin for most Black Americans; this sharply conflicts with **voyage records** and **genetics**. citeturn1search0turn1search6turn1search1

## Useful anchors if you want to read *across* camps
- **Voyage & demography baselines:** SlaveVoyages estimates + U.S. natural increase context. citeturn1search6turn1search8  
- **Genetic baselines:** U.S. African American ancestry patterns (large datasets). citeturn1search1turn1search7  
- **Movement primers:** Garvey/UNIA; NOI/*Message to the Blackman*; MSTA history; Hebrew Israelite overviews; Rastafari references; Afro-Native “IndiVisible”. citeturn0search4turn0search5turn0search1turn0search2turn0search8turn4search2

This gives you the current landscape: one dominant scholarly account rooted in ships, archives, and genomes; several large **Africa-anchored** identity movements with distinct sacred histories; a well-documented **Afro-Native** overlap; and a small but vocal **indigenous-origin** claim set that collides with the evidentiary baselines.
