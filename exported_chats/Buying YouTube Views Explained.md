# Buying YouTube Views Explained

---

How does buying YouTube views work and how much does it cost?

---



---

Buying YouTube views typically involves paying a service provider to artificially inflate the view count on a video. These services often use bots or incentivized users to watch the video, increasing the number of views. This practice can give the appearance of popularity or social proof, but it comes with significant risks. YouTube's algorithms can detect fake views, and if they do, the video might be penalized, which could lead to demonetization or even removal of the video.

The cost of buying YouTube views varies depending on the provider, the number of views you want, and the quality of the views (e.g., targeted by geography, retention rate). Prices can range from as little as a few dollars for a thousand views to hundreds of dollars for more significant amounts of high-retention views. However, it's important to note that buying views is against YouTube's terms of service, and doing so could jeopardize your channel.

Okay, what is it? Common practice?

---

Yes, buying YouTube views has become somewhat common, especially among those looking to quickly boost their video's visibility. Some creators and businesses may use it as a way to kickstart their content, hoping to attract real viewers by creating the appearance of popularity. However, despite its prevalence, it’s still considered a risky and frowned-upon practice.

Many content creators, especially those looking to build a long-term, sustainable presence on YouTube, avoid buying views because it can harm their reputation, lead to penalties from YouTube, and often results in low engagement (e.g., few likes, comments, or shares), which can signal to the algorithm that the video isn’t genuinely popular. Organic growth, while slower, tends to yield better results in terms of engagement and long-term success on the platform.

So how do they create the views?

---

The creation of fake YouTube views typically involves a few different methods, depending on the service used. Here are the most common ones:

1. **Bot Traffic**: This is one of the most common methods. Bots are automated programs designed to mimic human behavior. They can repeatedly "watch" a video, increasing the view count without any real human interaction. These views are usually low quality because they don't lead to meaningful engagement, like comments or likes.

2. **Click Farms**: Click farms involve large groups of people, often in countries with lower labor costs, who are paid to watch videos, click on ads, or interact with content. These views are slightly more human-like than bots, but they are still low quality because they don’t represent genuine interest in the content.

3. **Incentivized Views**: Some services offer views from real users who are incentivized with rewards like money, gift cards, or other benefits in exchange for watching videos. While these views are from real people, they often don’t lead to genuine engagement since the viewers are more interested in the reward than the content.

4. **Traffic Exchanges**: These are networks where users watch each other's videos to boost views. It's a "you watch mine, I'll watch yours" kind of system. While these views are technically from real people, they are not organic, and engagement remains low.

Each of these methods aims to inflate the view count, but they often lack the quality that comes from genuine, interested viewers. Moreover, YouTube’s algorithms are getting better at detecting fake views, and engaging in these practices can lead to penalties or even account termination.

Yeah, sounds like a good strategy for starting off a channel, though, and building up.

It can definitely be tempting as a quick way to give your channel a boost, especially when you're just starting out and trying to build some initial momentum. The appearance of higher view counts might make your videos look more popular and could potentially attract more organic viewers.

However, it’s important to weigh the risks. Relying on purchased views can create a false sense of success, and without genuine engagement, YouTube’s algorithm may not promote your content as effectively. Additionally, if YouTube detects inauthentic activity, it could lead to penalties that might harm your channel in the long run.

Focusing on creating high-quality content, engaging with your audience, and using legitimate promotion strategies might take more time, but it usually leads to more sustainable growth and a stronger, more loyal audience. If you're thinking of using purchased views as part of your strategy, it could be worthwhile to use them sparingly and in combination with more organic growth tactics.

So what's a good number of views to start out for each video for a new account?

---

For a new YouTube account, aiming for around 100 to 500 views per video can be a reasonable and achievable starting point. This range shows that there's some initial interest without raising any red flags for sudden, unnatural spikes in views, which might happen if you were to buy a large number of views too quickly.

Getting to this number organically might take some effort, but here are a few strategies to help you reach it:

1. **Promote on Social Media**: Share your videos across your social media platforms, encouraging friends and followers to watch and share.

2. **Engage with Communities**: Participate in online communities or forums related to your video's content. Share your videos where appropriate, but make sure to contribute to the community rather than just promoting.

3. **Optimize Your Videos**: Use good SEO practices—titles, tags, descriptions, and thumbnails—to make your videos more discoverable on YouTube.

4. **Consistency**: Uploading videos consistently helps to keep your channel active and can encourage repeat viewers.

5. **Collaborations**: If possible, collaborate with other YouTubers, even if they have small audiences. This can introduce your content to new viewers.

Starting with this target range can help you build a solid foundation, and as you grow your content and audience, your view counts should naturally increase over time.
