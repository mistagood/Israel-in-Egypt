# Bible Seers and Prophets



---

Dies the Bible forbid seers 

---



---

The Bible does not outright forbid *all* seers—but it draws a sharp line between **true** seers (prophets of God) and **false** ones (those using other spirits, or unauthorized channels). The issue is **who** is giving the vision, and whether that vision leads people **toward or away from obedience to God’s commandments**.

---

### 🔍 Biblical Definition of a Seer

A **seer** (Hebrew: *ro'eh* or *chozeh*) is someone who "sees" visions or receives divine insight. In the Bible:

- **Samuel** was called a *seer*:  
  > “Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, ‘Come, let us go to the seer,’ because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.”  
  — *1 Samuel 9:9*

- **Gad**, David’s counselor, was called “David’s seer” (2 Samuel 24:11)

- **Isaiah** is called a seer in *2 Chronicles 32:32*

So biblical prophets were often known as **seers**, meaning that seer in itself is not forbidden. Rather, it depends on the **source of the vision**.

### ⚠️ What *is* Forbidden: Divination, Sorcery, and False Seers

The Bible condemns practices **not rooted in the God of Israel**, such as:

- **Divination**, **sorcery**, **necromancy**, **omens**, and **consulting familiar spirits**:
  > “There shall not be found among you... a soothsayer, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.”  
  — *Deuteronomy 18:10–11*

- **False prophets** who claim to speak for God, but were not sent:
  > “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They fill you with false hope. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord.”  
  — *Jeremiah 23:16*

> **Key test**: *If the vision leads you away from the covenant (the Law/Torah), it is false—no matter how impressive it seems* (see Deut. 13:1–5)

| Seer (prophet of God) | *Ro’eh* / *Chozeh*     | ✅ Yes         | e.g. Samuel, Isaiah, Gad |
| Diviner / Soothsayer  | *Qasam*, *Aanan*       | ❌ Forbidden   | Uses unauthorized spiritual sources |
| Necromancer           | *Doresh el-ha-metim*   | ❌ Forbidden   | Calls on the dead |
| Prophet of lies       | *Navi sheker*          | ❌ Forbidden   | Claims to speak for God but was not sent |

### ✨ Final Thought

A seer is not automatically forbidden in the Bible. What matters is **whose spirit is behind the vision**. Moses and the prophets all received visions. What is condemned is *unauthorized spiritual insight* that pulls people away from God's covenant.

Much better. What about that time when David fought against Israel for Palestine?

---

You're likely referring to the **strange and often-overlooked episode** in **1 Samuel 27–29**, where **David, the future king of Israel, aligns himself with the Philistines**—Israel’s historic enemies—and almost goes to war **against Israel** itself.

Here’s a breakdown of the scene and what it implies:

---

## 📜 Background: David Flees to Philistia

> **1 Samuel 27:1**  
> *“And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines...”*

- David is **on the run from Saul**, who is trying to kill him.
- He **seeks asylum** with **Achish**, king of **Gath**, a major Philistine city (ironically, this is Goliath’s hometown).
- Achish gives him **Ziklag**, a city in Philistine territory, where David lives for over a year.

---

## ⚔️ David Becomes a Mercenary for Philistia

> **1 Samuel 28:1–2**  
> *“Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel... Then said Achish to David, ‘You must understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.’ David said to Achish, ‘Then you shall see what your servant can do.’”*

David agrees to fight **on the side of the Philistines** against his own people—**Israel**.

---

## 🧠 Hidden Meaning: David's Loyalty in Question?

This episode raises several **serious theological and prophetic questions**:

### 1. **Was David truly loyal to Israel—or to survival?**
- David had been **raiding other enemies of Israel** but telling Achish he was raiding Judah (1 Sam 27:10–12).  
- He was **deceiving Achish** while possibly maintaining a secret loyalty to Israel.

### 2. **Why was he willing to go to war against his own nation?**
- It's never made fully clear. David says, *“Then you will see what your servant can do.”* This could be ambiguous—does it mean fighting **for** or **against** Israel?

> Hidden insight: **David is playing a double agent**. The text never explicitly condemns this, but the tension is clear.

---

## 🛑 God's Intervention: David is Prevented from Fighting Israel

> **1 Samuel 29:4–5**  
> The Philistine commanders say:  
> *“Send the man back, that he may return to the place you have assigned him... lest in the battle he become an adversary to us.”*

- The Philistine princes **reject David’s participation** out of fear he might **betray them mid-battle**.
- Achish reluctantly sends David away.

🧠 **Key Point**: David is providentially **blocked by God** from committing the treasonous act of fighting against Israel.

---

## 🔍 Prophetic Implication

This strange story aligns with the **prophetic pattern of testing the hearts of leaders**:

- David was in **exile**, much like **Moses** in Midian or **Joseph** in Egypt—foreign lands where identity is tested.
- David **walks the line between loyalty and survival**, but **God does not allow him to cross a line** that would destroy his legitimacy as king.
- This reinforces the prophetic theme:  
  > “The LORD trieth the righteous…” (*Psalm 11:5*)  
  > “He is a shield to them that walk uprightly.” (*Proverbs 2:7*)

---

## 🧭 Symbolic Meaning: David vs. Saul / Moses vs. Paul

If we map this to your deeper symbolic framework:

- David, like Moses, **refuses to strike down his brothers**, even when aligned with an enemy force.
- Paul, however, as a **Benjamite (like Saul)**, openly **persecutes the assembly**—and is not prevented from doing so.
- This contrast shows how God **restrains** his chosen vessels (like David), while **blindness is allowed** in those who are rejected.

## ✨ Summary

| **Aspect**              | **David**                                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fights for Philistia?   | Almost, but providentially stopped (1 Samuel 29)           |
| Motive unclear          | Likely strategic survival—but double agent language hints  |
| Loyalty tested          | Yes, but God intervenes to protect Israelite bloodline     |
| Prophetic fulfillment   | A king in exile; tested, refined, but spared from betrayal |
| Hidden insight          | God prevented him from *"becoming Saul"*                   |

You can just describe the events for me from now on and give me the Bible verses and the breakdown without the symbolic meaning, commentary, and all of that, because that's just speculation. I'm just looking for the breakdown and the stories. The truth is David did a lot of wild stuff when he was out there and even after he became king by killing Uriah and sleeping with his wife and all of that trying to cuckold Uriah you know all of this and then slaying a man so it's a complex character he also ate the showbread and and got the priest there and them killed so I mean it was he lied and got them killed but it was Saul who killed them still and so David also took the man's wife Abigail and kind of uh was extorting the man or making him pay for protection in some ways as well as uh deceiving people and um like the king Akish he played crazy he did a lot of wild things so so David is a complex character he's a real man he's just a real person who's not a perfect biblical figure he's an individual who was tried in many ways was tempted in many ways we don't know what David would have did but it would have been a wonderful opportunity for him knowing his past of how he continued to try and try and try to show Saul that he was his servant it would have been a wonderful opportunity for him to try to show Saul that he was a servant by defeating those uh philistines turning on them in battle after all he had been lying to him stringing him along the whole time making him think that he would actually fight against or kill or raid Israel when he was really raiding enemies of Israel or philistines so the analysis goes further and if you write down the story I can guide the analysis
