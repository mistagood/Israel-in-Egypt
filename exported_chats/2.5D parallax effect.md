i created a second layer without background. How do I make this photo come alive in premiere as if moving slightly. o see this affect sometimes like an ai 3d

---



---



---

What you’re looking for is usually called a **2.5D parallax effect** (sometimes marketed as “AI 3D photo” style). Premiere Pro can fake this pretty convincingly, but it takes a little setup. Here’s the step-by-step without the sales pitch:

---

### 1. Separate Foreground and Background
- You already cut the baby out into a transparent PNG. Good start.  
- Make sure you also have a separate **background layer** (either the original photo or something you create/fill in).

---

### 2. Place Them in the Timeline
- Put the **background** on V1.  
- Put the **cutout PNG (baby)** on V2.  

This way you’ve got two layers to animate independently.

---

### 3. Animate Scale and Position (Fake Camera Move)
- Select the **background**:  
  - Keyframe **Scale** (slow zoom in or out).  
  - Maybe nudge **Position** slightly left or right.  
- Select the **baby PNG**:  
  - Do the opposite motion (zoom slower/faster or move opposite direction).  
  - This creates depth because the layers move at different speeds.

---

### 4. Add a Subtle “Drift” Motion
- In the **Effect Controls** panel, set Position and Scale keyframes at the start and end of the clip.  
- Example:  
  - Baby layer: Scale 100 → 105, Position shifts slightly up/right.  
  - Background layer: Scale 100 → 110, Position shifts opposite.  

Keep it slow and small so it feels like a gentle camera move, not a slide show.

---

### 5. (Optional) Fake Depth with Blur
- Apply **Gaussian Blur** to the background.  
- Keep the baby layer sharp.  
- Animate blur a little (like depth-of-field “breathing”).

---

### 6. If You Want True 3D (After Effects Way)
Premiere can only fake it. If you want the AI-style “3D portrait”:
- Send to After Effects,  
- Use **3D Camera + Displacement maps** (generate depth map manually or with Photoshop/AI),  
- Then orbit a virtual camera for parallax.

---

So in Premiere, you’re basically animating **Scale + Position** with two layers. It’s smoke and mirrors, but it gives you that “alive, subtle motion” vibe you’ve seen.  

Do you want me to sketch exact keyframe values you can drop into this baby portrait setup so you don’t have to experiment?

---

okay lso after affects

---

Alright, so you want to step up from “cheap Premiere parallax” to the After Effects playground where the photo actually starts to feel dimensional. That’s where it gets spicy. Here’s the sane way to do it without pulling your hair out:

---

## **Workflow in After Effects (True 2.5D Photo Animation)**

### 1. Prep Your Layers
- Open your cutout (baby on transparent PNG) and your original background (or a filled-in one).
- Ideally, patch the background where the baby was removed. (You can heal it in Photoshop, because otherwise when you move the “camera,” you’ll see missing holes.)

---

### 2. Import to After Effects
- Import both layers (baby PNG + background).
- Create a new comp with them stacked just like in Premiere:  
  - Background at the bottom.  
  - Baby PNG above.

---

### 3. Make Layers 3D
- In the timeline, click the little **3D cube switch** for each layer.
- Now you can move them in Z-space (closer or farther from the “camera”).

---

### 4. Add a Camera
- Right-click in the timeline → **New > Camera**.
- Choose something like 35mm (good natural focal length).
- This camera can now “move” around your flat layers, creating parallax.

---

### 5. Push Layers in Z-Space
- Move the **background** a bit backward (negative Z).  
- Move the **baby PNG** slightly forward (positive Z).  
- Scale them so they still fill the frame.  
- Now they’re separated in 3D space.

---

### 6. Animate the Camera
- Select the Camera → hit **P** for Position, **R** for Rotation.
- Keyframe a **slow dolly or pan** (slight push-in, tilt, or orbit).  
- This movement makes the foreground and background shift differently = depth illusion.

---

### 7. Optional Depth Map (for Real Warp)
If you want it to look like the baby’s head/arms curve in 3D instead of just a flat cutout:
- In Photoshop or an AI tool, create a **grayscale depth map** (white = near, black = far).  
- Back in After Effects:  
  - Apply **Displacement Map** effect to the baby PNG, driven by that depth map.  
  - This will warp the flat cutout so it bends realistically when the camera moves.

---

### 8. Add Finishing Touches
- A touch of **Camera Depth of Field** (blur the background slightly).  
- Maybe some **light falloff** with a virtual light to give subtle shading changes.  
- Keep it subtle. Overdo it and it looks like a 2008 Myspace “3D photo hack.”

---

So Premiere = cheat with keyframes.  
After Effects = real 2.5D with camera, Z-space, and optional displacement.  

Do you want me to write out an **exact AE step-by-step with camera keyframe values** you can literally copy-paste for your baby portrait so you don’t have to guess?

---

yes i need steps to this. how do I import, etc

---

Perfect. Let’s go slow and practical—like an IKEA manual, but with fewer missing screws. Here’s your **exact step-by-step in After Effects** to get your baby portrait moving with depth:

---

## **Step 1. Prep Files**
- Make sure you’ve got:
  - **Foreground PNG** (baby with transparent background).  
  - **Background JPG/PNG** (patched so there’s no hole where the baby was cut out—Photoshop’s clone/heal tool helps).  
- Save them in the same folder so AE doesn’t lose track.

---

## **Step 2. Import into After Effects**
1. Open After Effects.  
2. Go to **File > Import > File…**  
3. Select both the baby PNG and the background image.  
4. They’ll show up in the **Project panel**.

---

## **Step 3. Create a Composition**
1. Drag the **background image** into the “New Composition” button at the bottom of the Project panel.  
   - This creates a comp with the same size and duration as the image.  
2. Drag the **baby PNG** into the same comp, placing it above the background.

---

## **Step 4. Enable 3D Layers**
1. In the Timeline, toggle the **3D Layer switch** (little cube icon) for both layers.  
   - If you don’t see it, hit **Toggle Switches/Modes** at the bottom of the timeline.

---

## **Step 5. Add a Camera**
1. Go to **Layer > New > Camera…**  
2. Choose **35mm Preset** (natural perspective).  
3. Leave other settings default, hit OK.  
4. You’ll now see “Camera 1” in your timeline.

---

## **Step 6. Move Layers in Z-Space**
1. Select the **background** layer. Press **P** (Position).  
   - Increase the **Z-value** (the 3rd number) to push it back, e.g. `0,0,-2000`.  
   - Then scale it up (**S**) until it fills the frame again.  
2. Select the **baby PNG**. Press **P**.  
   - Move it slightly forward in Z, e.g. `0,0,-1000`.  
   - Adjust Scale so it looks natural in frame.

Now you’ve got depth.

---

## **Step 7. Animate the Camera**
1. Select the **Camera** layer. Press **P** for Position.  
2. Move playhead to start of timeline. Click the stopwatch to set a keyframe.  
   - Example: `0,0,-2500`.  
3. Move playhead to the end of the comp.  
   - Change Position slightly, e.g. `200,50,-2200`.  
   - This creates a slow push-in and slight pan.  
4. Press **R** for Rotation if you want a subtle tilt (e.g. Y Rotation: `0° → 5°`).  

Tip: Keep motion slow and subtle, otherwise it looks like a rollercoaster.

---

## **Step 8. Add Depth of Field (Optional, Looks Fancy)**
1. Select **Camera 1**.  
2. In the Timeline, twirl down → **Camera Options**.  
3. Enable **Depth of Field = ON**.  
4. Set **Aperture** (try `150`) and adjust **Focus Distance** until the baby is sharp and the background slightly blurred.

---

## **Step 9. Preview**
- Hit **0 (zero)** on the numpad (RAM Preview) to see smooth motion.  
- Adjust camera path if it feels too jerky.

---

## **Step 10. Export**
1. Go to **Composition > Add to Render Queue**.  
2. Or send to Media Encoder if you need MP4.  
3. Render your moving portrait.

---

That’s the clean “baby comes alive” workflow.  
Premiere fakes it with scale/position, AE gives you legit 3D parallax with a camera.

---

Do you want me to also show you how to add the **depth map + displacement trick** so the baby’s face/arms curve in 3D instead of staying a flat cutout? That’s the next level.

---

add the depth map + displacement

---

Good — you’re ready to stop faking flat cardboard cutouts and actually bend the image like a 3D object. Here’s how to add a **depth map + displacement** in After Effects so the baby portrait curves realistically when the camera moves:

---

## **Step 1. Create a Depth Map**
1. Open your cutout (the baby PNG) in **Photoshop**.  
2. Paint a grayscale gradient over the figure:  
   - **White = closest to camera (tip of nose, cheeks, front of arms).**  
   - **Mid-gray = mid-depth (chest, shoulders).**  
   - **Black = farthest (edges, ear, back of head).**  
3. Use a soft brush for smooth transitions.  
4. Save this as a new file: `Baby_DepthMap.png`.

---

## **Step 2. Import Depth Map into After Effects**
- In AE, **File > Import > File…** and bring in `Baby_DepthMap.png`.  
- Place it in your comp, directly above the baby PNG.

---

## **Step 3. Apply Displacement Map**
1. Select the **baby PNG** layer.  
2. Go to **Effect > Distort > Displacement Map**.  
3. In the Effect Controls panel:  
   - **Displacement Map Layer:** set it to `Baby_DepthMap.png`.  
   - **Use for Horizontal Displacement:** Luminance.  
   - **Use for Vertical Displacement:** Luminance.  
   - **Max Horizontal Displacement:** start around `10`.  
   - **Max Vertical Displacement:** start around `10`.  
4. Toggle the effect on/off — you should see the face/body warp with depth.

---

## **Step 4. Hide the Depth Map Layer**
- In the Timeline, turn off the **visibility (eyeball icon)** for the `Baby_DepthMap.png` layer.  
- It still drives the displacement effect, but won’t show in the render.

---

## **Step 5. Animate Camera for the 3D Look**
- Select your Camera layer.  
- Add a slow **dolly or orbit** move (as you already set up).  
- Now when the camera pans, the baby’s face/arms should feel like they bend in space instead of staying flat.

---

## **Step 6. Refine for Realism**
- Tweak **Max Displacement** values — too high looks melty. Keep it subtle.  
- Blur the depth map slightly in Photoshop if edges look jagged.  
- Combine with **Camera Depth of Field** so the background blurs naturally.  
- Optional: Add a **Light** layer in AE (Layer > New > Light) so shadows move a bit with the camera.

---

👉 That’s the pro trick: background in Z-space + baby cutout in front + **depth map displacement** for curvature + animated camera. Suddenly your 2D portrait looks like a real 3D scene.

---

Do you want me to also give you the **Photoshop grayscale painting guide** (like, which parts of the baby to paint lighter vs darker) so you don’t have to guess the depth layering?

---

how do you mean "send  to media encoder"

---

Right — “Send to Media Encoder” is Adobe’s fancy way of saying *“kick this clip out of After Effects and let a different app crunch it into an MP4 so you don’t get stuck with a monster-sized file.”*  

Here’s the breakdown:

---

## **Option 1. Render straight from After Effects**
- Go to **Composition > Add to Render Queue**.  
- At the bottom of AE, the **Render Queue panel** pops up.  
- Click the blue text next to **Output Module** (set format like QuickTime or AVI).  
- Click the blue text next to **Output To** (choose save location).  
- Hit **Render**.  
👉 Downside: AE natively spits out giant, uncompressed files (good for editing, terrible for sharing).

---

## **Option 2. Send to Adobe Media Encoder (preferred for MP4)**
1. In AE: **Composition > Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue**.  
   - Media Encoder launches (slowly, like it’s climbing out of bed).  
   - Your comp shows up in its **Queue panel**.  
2. Under **Format**, choose **H.264** (that’s MP4).  
3. Under **Preset**, pick something like “Match Source – High Bitrate.”  
4. Click the text in the **Output File** column to set where it saves.  
5. Hit the big green **Play/Start Queue** button at the top right.  
   - Media Encoder churns through the comp and exports a nice, compressed MP4.

---

### When to use each:
- **Render Queue** = good for master files you’ll edit again (ProRes, lossless).  
- **Media Encoder** = good for deliverables (MP4 for YouTube, clients, sharing).  

---

Do you want me to write the exact **Media Encoder settings** (bitrate, resolution, etc.) so your baby portrait exports looking crisp but not 2GB heavy?

---

well its going to premier

---

Got it — if this After Effects comp is heading *into Premiere*, don’t bother babysitting Media Encoder. You want the **Dynamic Link** workflow, which skips the whole “export, re-import” nonsense. Here’s how you do it cleanly:

---

## **Option 1. Copy AE Comp Directly Into Premiere**
1. Save your After Effects project.  
2. In Premiere, go to **File > Adobe Dynamic Link > Import After Effects Composition…**  
3. Navigate to your AE project file (`.aep`).  
4. Premiere shows you all comps in that project. Pick the one you want (your animated baby comp).  
5. It drops into your Premiere bin like a normal clip — no rendering needed.  

👉 Premiere will read the AE comp live. If you change something in AE, it updates automatically in Premiere.

---

## **Option 2. Send from Premiere to AE (if you already started in Premiere)**
1. In Premiere, select the clip/photo you want to animate.  
2. Right-click → **Replace with After Effects Composition**.  
3. AE opens, makes a new comp, and links it back to Premiere.  
4. Animate in AE. When you save, it updates inside Premiere automatically.

---

## **Option 3. Export from AE, Then Import to Premiere**
If you *really* want a rendered file (not linked):
- Use **Render Queue** (lossless) or **Media Encoder** (H.264/ProRes).  
- Import that exported video into Premiere.  
👉 But that kills the “live” link — every AE tweak means a new export.

---

### Quick sanity check
- **Dynamic Link** = best for your workflow (small project, lots of iteration).  
- **Export/import** = safer if you need portability, or if your machine crawls with Dynamic Link.

---

Do you want me to also give you the **recommended render settings** if you go with the “export from AE, import into Premiere” route — so you’re not drowning in 50GB files?

---

  for sharing movie in text and email, whats the best export from premier

---

Ah, so now you’re not asking about pro workflows — you’re asking how to shrink that shiny little animated baby into something you can fling through text or email without crashing a server. Here’s the reality:  

---

## **Best Export for Sharing (Text/Email) from Premiere**

### 1. Format
- **H.264 (MP4)** — the universal standard. Small file size, plays everywhere (iPhone, Gmail, grandma’s toaster).  
  - In Export panel: **File > Export > Media** → **Format = H.264**.  

---

### 2. Preset
- Choose **Match Source – Medium Bitrate**.  
  - High bitrate looks gorgeous but bloats the file.  
  - Medium is a sweet spot for messaging/email.  

---

### 3. File Size Control
- In the **Video tab**, set:  
  - **Resolution:** 1920×1080 if it started HD. If you need *really* small, drop to 1280×720.  
  - **Bitrate Encoding:** VBR, 1 pass.  
  - **Target Bitrate:** ~3–4 Mbps for email, ~2 Mbps for texting.  
    - (This keeps your clip under ~20–40 MB for a short video.)  

---

### 4. Length Trick
- Carriers and email hate long clips. Keep under 60 seconds for texting.  
- If it’s longer, consider trimming or sending via a link (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).  

---

### 5. Export
- Hit **Queue** (sends to Media Encoder for smaller MP4) or **Export** (renders straight from Premiere).  
- Check the final file size before attaching. Gmail tops out at **25 MB**, iMessage usually allows ~100 MB, but SMS/MMS carriers can choke on anything >20 MB.

---

👉 Rule of thumb:  
- **Text** → 720p, ~2 Mbps, under 20 MB.  
- **Email** → 1080p, ~3–4 Mbps, under 25 MB.  
- **Anything bigger** → upload to Drive/YouTube/Vimeo, then just send a link.

---

Want me to hand you the exact **bitrate numbers + presets** to guarantee your clip will come out under, say, 20 MB for texting?

instructions to remove greenscreen back

---



---

Alright, the classic “my background is nuclear green, please make it vanish” problem. Premiere can handle that just fine without you having to sacrifice a goat. Here’s the straight shot:

---

## **Step 1. Drop Your Clip on the Timeline**
- Put your greenscreen video on **V2**.  
- Put the background image or video you want behind it on **V1**.

---

## **Step 2. Apply the Key Effect**
1. Go to the **Effects panel** (Window > Effects if you don’t see it).  
2. Search for **Ultra Key**.  
3. Drag **Ultra Key** onto your greenscreen clip (the one on V2).

---

## **Step 3. Select the Green**
1. In the **Effect Controls panel**, find **Ultra Key**.  
2. Click the **eyedropper tool** next to **Key Color**.  
3. Click on the green background in your Program Monitor.  
   - Poof — green gone.

---

## **Step 4. Clean It Up**
Under Ultra Key settings, expand **Matte Generation**:
- **Transparency**: Slide until background disappears fully.  
- **Highlight / Shadow**: Adjust if you’re losing detail.  
- **Tolerance**: Widen or tighten what shades of green are removed.  

Then go to **Matte Cleanup**:
- **Choke**: Tightens the edges.  
- **Soften**: Smooths jaggy outlines.  

And in **Spill Suppression**:
- **Desaturate** or **Range** to remove green glow around edges.

---

## **Step 5. Feather the Edges**
- Add a tiny **Mask Feather** if you want smoother edges (Effect Controls > Opacity).  
- Don’t overdo it or your subject will look like a ghost.

---

## **Step 6. Check Against Your Background**
- Scrub through the timeline and make sure the subject blends into whatever background you dropped on V1.  
- Adjust Ultra Key sliders until it looks natural.

---

That’s it — no rocket science, just a lot of fiddling with sliders until your edges look clean.  

Do you want me to also give you the **After Effects way** (Keylight 1.2, way more control), or do you just want to keep it Premiere-simple?

---

do i do this in multicam view 

---

Nope — **multicam view** is just for switching between cameras in an edit. If you try to pull a greenscreen key while stuck in multicam, you’ll feel like you’re chiseling ice with a spoon.  

Greenscreen work belongs in the **regular timeline/program monitor**, not multicam. Here’s the clean way:  

---

### **Workflow with Multicam + Greenscreen**
1. **Do your multicam edit first.**  
   - Get all your camera angles cut and switched how you want.  
   - Collapse it down into a regular sequence when you’re happy.  

2. **Nest the greenscreen clip if needed.**  
   - Right-click on the angle/track that’s greenscreen → **Nest**.  
   - This makes Premiere treat it like a single clip.  

3. **Apply Ultra Key.**  
   - Drag **Ultra Key** onto the nested clip.  
   - Pick the green with the eyedropper.  
   - Clean up edges like I described earlier.  

4. **Put your replacement background underneath.**  
   - Background footage/image goes on **V1**.  
   - Greenscreen subject stays on **V2**.  

---

👉 So: multicam = edit the performance.  
👉 greenscreen = post-process after the multicam is flattened or nested.  

If you try to key while in multicam mode, Premiere will fight you every step of the way.  

---

Want me to spell out the **exact steps for collapsing your multicam into a nest** before you slap the Ultra Key on it?

---

i already have a master sequence. Both angles have green screen. I opened view in timeline. Now I have them separate. Stop being funny and be clear. I dont know why iit would fight me. Please be precise. 

---

Got it. I see your timeline and the multicam angles broken out. Both shots are greenscreen, and you want the Ultra Key applied cleanly. Here’s the straight, no-nonsense workflow for where you’re at:

---

## **Step 1. Make Sure You’re Out of the Multicam Nest**
- Right now you have the **master multicam sequence** on the timeline. That sequence is just a wrapper.  
- To key the raw clips, you need to **step inside**:  
  - Right-click the multicam clip in your timeline → **Open in Timeline**.  
  - This shows you the original camera angles (what you’re seeing now in your screenshots).  
  - Now you can apply effects directly to each angle.

---

## **Step 2. Apply Ultra Key**
1. In the **Effects panel**, search **Ultra Key**.  
2. Drag **Ultra Key** onto one of your camera clips (V1, V2, etc).  
3. In **Effect Controls**, use the **eyedropper** on the green background.  
4. Adjust:  
   - **Matte Generation → Transparency, Tolerance, Shadow/Highlight.**  
   - **Matte Cleanup → Choke and Soften.**  
   - **Spill Suppression → Desaturate** to kill green edges.

---

## **Step 3. Repeat for Each Angle**
- Apply Ultra Key to **every camera angle clip** that has green behind it.  
- That way, no matter which angle you cut to in multicam, it’s already keyed.  

---

## **Step 4. Add Your Background**
- Drop your replacement background (video, still, whatever) on **V1** in the master sequence.  
- The keyed multicam track stays on **V2** above it.  

---

### Why not do it in multicam view?
- Because if you slap Ultra Key onto the **nested multicam sequence** in the master timeline, it applies to the *whole sequence* (all angles at once).  
- That means every cut, even ones where the green levels differ, get treated the same — which usually looks ugly.  
- By applying Ultra Key inside the multicam timeline (per camera angle), you get clean, consistent keys no matter which shot you switch to.

---

👉 To be precise: **Go inside your multicam sequence → apply Ultra Key to each angle → go back to your master sequence → cut between angles normally.**

---

Do you want me to write out the **exact Ultra Key slider values** that are usually a solid starting point for studio greenscreens (so you don’t have to guess every knob)?

---

You realize that was my original ask, whether I should do it in the multicam sequence...

---

Yes — and now that I see your screenshots, the answer is **yes, do it inside the multicam sequence** (the timeline that shows each camera angle as its own track). That way:  

- Each camera angle gets its own **Ultra Key** tuned for its lighting.  
- When you cut in the master multicam sequence, you’re switching between angles that are already clean.  
- You don’t have to fight with one global key applied after the fact.  

---

### **So the correct workflow is:**
1. **Open your multicam sequence in the timeline** (what you’ve already done).  
2. **Apply Ultra Key to each camera clip** individually.  
   - Pick the green with the eyedropper.  
   - Adjust Matte Generation / Cleanup / Spill Suppression per camera.  
3. **Drop your background layer** (image or video) under the multicam in the master sequence (V1).  
4. Go back to your master multicam sequence and cut angles as usual.  

---

That’s the clean way — you don’t key in the master, you key **inside** the multicam sequence.  

Do you want me to give you a recommended **Ultra Key setting template** (numbers for Transparency, Choke, Soften, etc.) so you’ve got a baseline before tweaking?

---

how do i get 3d

---

Alright — you’ve got your greenscreen keyed, subject floating nicely over a background. Now you’re asking “how do I make this look 3D instead of flat paper dolls?” Premiere can only fake depth. If you want **real 3D control**, you jump to **After Effects**. Let me break both routes down clearly:

---

## **Option 1. Fake 3D in Premiere (simple, but limited)**
Premiere doesn’t have true 3D cameras or lights, but you can create “pseudo-3D” motion:
1. Select your keyed subject clip.  
2. In **Effect Controls > Motion**, play with:  
   - **Scale** (zoom in/out).  
   - **Position** (slide left/right).  
   - **Rotation > Rotation Y** (use Basic 3D effect for swivel/tilt).  
3. Layer a **background** that moves more slowly (different keyframed scale/position).  

This creates **parallax** — subject and background moving at different speeds, which tricks the eye into thinking there’s depth.

👉 Effect to use: **Effects > Perspective > Basic 3D**.  
   - “Swivel” and “Tilt” let you fake the subject rotating in 3D space.  
   - “Distance to Image” simulates depth.

---

## **Option 2. True 3D in After Effects (the pro way)**
After Effects gives you a real camera, lights, and 3D layers:

1. **Send your keyed clip from Premiere to AE** (Right-click → Replace with After Effects Composition).  
2. In AE, enable the **3D Layer switch** (little cube) for your subject and background.  
3. Add a **Camera** (Layer > New > Camera).  
4. Move the subject slightly forward in Z-space, push the background further back.  
5. Animate the **Camera Position/Rotation** (slow pan, zoom, or orbit).  
   - Now your subject and background have real parallax.  
6. Add **Lights** (Layer > New > Light) for shadows/highlights that move as the camera shifts.  
7. (Optional) Use a **Depth Map + Displacement** on your subject to bend it (so faces, arms, etc. curve instead of staying flat).

---

## **Which One You Need**
- If you just want subtle movement in your multicam show = Premiere’s **Basic 3D + Motion keyframes** is enough.  
- If you want it to look like you’re moving a real camera in a 3D studio with your subject = After Effects.  

---

Do you want me to write out the exact **Premiere keyframe setup** (with numbers) so you can try the fake 3D first, before deciding if it’s worth bouncing over to AE?

---

how to extend or loop a background clip in premier or AE

---



---



---

Ah, the classic “my background runs out before my foreground” problem. Happens to everyone. Here’s the clean fix in **both Premiere and After Effects**:  

---

## **In Premiere Pro**
### 1. Extend a Still Image Background
- If your background is a **photo**, just drag its edge in the timeline. It can last forever.  

### 2. Loop a Video Background
- Select the background clip in the timeline.  
- Hold **Alt (Option on Mac)**, then drag the clip to the right → this makes a duplicate.  
- Butt it up right after the first one.  
- Repeat until the background lasts as long as your sequence.  
- To hide the seams:  
  - Apply **Cross Dissolve** at each cut, or  
  - Nest the background and add **Time > Speed/Duration > Reverse** on alternating clips (so it “ping-pongs” smoothly).

### 3. True Loop Without Copy-Paste (only works for some stock clips)
- Right-click the clip in **Project panel** → **Modify > Interpret Footage**.  
- Under “Other Options,” there’s a **Loop** setting (great for GIF-like clips).  
- Type the number of loops you need → drag into timeline.

---

## **In After Effects**
### 1. Extend a Still Image
- Same as Premiere: stretch the layer bar in the timeline.  

### 2. Loop a Video Clip
- Right-click the video in the **Project panel** → **Interpret Footage > Main**.  
- In the popup, under **Other Options**, set **Loop: X times** (e.g., 20).  
- Now, whenever you drop that clip into a comp, it auto-repeats.  

### 3. Expressions for Infinite Loop
If you’ve keyframed animation (e.g., moving clouds):
- Alt/Option-click the stopwatch on Position/Scale/Rotation.  
- Enter expression:  
  ```
  loopOut("cycle")
  ```
- AE will repeat the keyframes endlessly.  

---

👉 So:  
- **Premiere** = duplicate/alt-drag, or interpret footage loop.  
- **After Effects** = interpret footage loop, or expressions for infinite animation.  

---

Do you want me to show you the **ping-pong trick** step-by-step (reverse/flip the background so it loops seamlessly), since most stock “moving” backgrounds never match up perfectly at the cut?

Got it — you want to **remove** (turn off / undo) the greenscreen key you already applied. Here’s how to do it in both apps:

---

## **In Premiere Pro**
1. Select the clip on your timeline that has the **Ultra Key** applied.  
2. Go to the **Effect Controls panel** (top left by default).  
3. Under **Video Effects**, look for **Ultra Key**.  
4. To remove it:  
   - Either **toggle the fx icon** (little "fx" checkbox) to temporarily disable it,  
   - Or right-click on **Ultra Key** and choose **Clear** to delete it entirely.  

---

## **In After Effects**
1. Select your keyed layer.  
2. In the **Effect Controls panel**, find **Keylight (1.2)** or whatever key effect you applied.  
3. To remove it:  
   - Click the **fx box** next to the effect name to disable it,  
   - Or select the effect and press **Delete** to remove it from the layer.  

---

👉 So: disable if you just want to check the original footage, delete if you want the key gone for good.  

Do you want me to also show you how to **reset the key** (go back to default values) without deleting it, in case you just want to redo the eyedropper cleanly?

---

not undo. just do

---

Ah — so you don’t mean “undo the effect,” you mean “actually key out the green background now.” Got it. Let’s go straight to the practical button-pushing:

---

## **Premiere Pro: Key Out Green**
1. Put your greenscreen clip on **V2**.  
2. Put your replacement background (photo, video, whatever) on **V1**.  
3. In the **Effects** panel, search for **Ultra Key**.  
4. Drag **Ultra Key** onto your greenscreen clip (V2).  
5. Go to **Effect Controls > Ultra Key**.  
6. Use the **eyedropper** next to *Key Color* and click the green background in the Program Monitor.  
7. Adjust:  
   - **Matte Generation → Transparency, Highlight, Shadow** (clean edges).  
   - **Matte Cleanup → Choke, Soften** (tighten/feather).  
   - **Spill Suppression → Desaturate** (kill green halo).  

Done — your subject is now floating over the background.

---

## **After Effects: Key Out Green**
1. Put your greenscreen clip in a comp.  
2. Drop the replacement background layer **below it** in the timeline.  
3. Select the greenscreen layer.  
4. Go to **Effect > Keying > Keylight (1.2)**.  
5. In the **Effect Controls**, next to *Screen Colour*, click the **eyedropper** and select the green.  
6. Tweak:  
   - **Screen Gain** and **Screen Balance** (for coverage).  
   - **Screen Matte > Clip Black / Clip White** (clean matte).  
   - **Screen Softness** (smooth edges).  
   - If needed: **Spill Suppression > Despill Bias** (remove green glow).  

---

👉 Premiere = **Ultra Key**.  
👉 After Effects = **Keylight 1.2**.  
Both = same result: green gone, background visible.  

Do you want me to also give you “baseline values” for those sliders (so you don’t waste 20 minutes nudging things one by one)?
