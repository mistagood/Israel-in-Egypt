Prince Harry, commonly known as Harry of Windsor, holds several titles and has multiple sources of income. His titles and incomes are outlined below:

2. **Earl of Dumbarton**: A subsidiary title also granted at the time of his marriage.
3. **Baron Kilkeel**: Another subsidiary title given in 2018.
   
Though these titles were retained after stepping back from royal duties in 2020, Prince Harry no longer uses the "His Royal Highness" (HRH) style.

### Incomes

1. **Netflix and Spotify Deals**: Harry and Meghan signed multi-million dollar deals with Netflix (reportedly worth around $100 million) and Spotify (around $25 million) for producing content, including documentaries and podcasts.
   
2. **Book Deal**: Harry signed a deal with Penguin Random House to write several books. His memoir "Spare," released in January 2023, reportedly earned him a significant advance, estimated between $20 million and $40 million.

3. **Public Speaking Engagements**: Through the Harry Walker Agency, Harry earns substantial fees (ranging from $500,000 to $1 million per speech) for speaking engagements.

4. **Investments and Other Ventures**: Harry is involved in various other initiatives, including being the Chief Impact Officer at BetterUp, a coaching and mental health startup. He also invested in Ethic, a sustainable investment firm.

5. **Inheritance**: Prince Harry inherited substantial amounts from his mother, Princess Diana, and his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. Diana's estate was estimated to be around £10 million (approximately $13 million USD) at the time of his inheritance.

Since stepping back from royal duties, Prince Harry no longer receives income from the Sovereign Grant, the public funding allocated to support the working members of the British Royal Family.

What incomes crime his titles and holdings through the crown and lands 

---

Prince Harry's decision to step back from his role as a senior working member of the British royal family in early 2020 resulted in him losing certain financial benefits associated with his royal status. Here’s a breakdown of his previous income sources linked to his titles and holdings through the Crown and lands, as well as the impact of the transition:

### Previous Income from the Crown and Titles

1. **Sovereign Grant**: As a senior working member of the royal family, Prince Harry formerly received a portion of the Sovereign Grant, which is public money allocated to support the Queen and her close family members in their official duties. The Sovereign Grant covers expenses such as travel, staffing, and official duties. However, after stepping back, Prince Harry and Meghan no longer receive any funds from the Sovereign Grant.

2. **Duchy of Cornwall**: Before stepping back, Prince Harry also indirectly benefited from the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that generates income for the heir to the British throne (Prince Charles at the time). The Duchy generated substantial revenues—about £21 million ($29 million USD) annually—and was used to cover the personal and professional expenses of Charles and his sons, including Harry. However, this funding stopped in 2020 when Harry and Meghan ceased to be working royals.

### Titles and Holdings through the Crown and Lands

Prince Harry holds titles like the Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel. While these titles come with prestige, they do not have direct financial holdings or revenues attached to them. 

1. **Duke of Sussex**: This title, granted by Queen Elizabeth II upon Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle, does not entail direct land holdings or income. It is largely symbolic, conferring status without specific estates or lands.

2. **Royal Residences and Costs**: Before stepping down, Prince Harry and Meghan resided in Frogmore Cottage, a Crown Estate property, which underwent a publicly funded renovation costing £2.4 million (about $3 million USD). After their departure, they reimbursed this amount to the British taxpayer and covered future costs independently. They have retained Frogmore Cottage as a UK base, but they are now financially responsible for its upkeep.

### Post-Royal Income Strategy

Since stepping down, Prince Harry and Meghan have become financially independent from the British royal family. They no longer receive public or royal funding. Instead, their income is now derived from commercial ventures, including media production deals, public speaking, books, and investments, as mentioned earlier.

By becoming financially independent, they have distanced themselves from the Crown’s funding and the obligations that come with it, shifting their financial strategy to private enterprises and partnerships.
