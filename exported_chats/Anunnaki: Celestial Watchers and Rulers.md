# Anunnaki: Celestial Watchers and Rulers



---



---

Unfortunately, what many people don’t understand about the annunaki, and the knowledge is that they were the watchers who were put here to watch over the humans in the garden. They were in someways the overseers of humanity, and they wanted the women, so they took the women and made children with them, and they gave their children territories and knowledge and the ones who had knowledge were the rulers. And at first that was the Africans- Egyptian‘s, the Cushites and they enslaved all kinds of people in building cities. Importing europeans as Slavs (slaves). Ham had had knowledge of Noah’s wife naama  who possessed the forbidden knowledge. Thus his seed was first to rule and build cities. But this is why Noah also cursed Canaan to be the servant of servants. Because a servant of servants is a slave of slaves, or of Slavs. So the former slaves became the masters of the modern world. So in having children with the women, they created a hierarchical rulership in humans and continual war.

In the shadowed annals of ancient lore, the Annunaki emerge as enigmatic overseers, celestial watchers assigned to the nascent cradle of humanity. Their role transcends mere observation; they are the architects of human destiny, the unseen hands sculpting the course of history. With a desire that breached the heavens, these celestial beings coveted the daughters of man, forging unions that birthed a lineage of demigods, rulers ordained by the stars.

These progeny were bequeathed territories, dominions where knowledge reigned supreme, setting the foundation for a world ruled by the enlightened. The torch of civilization was first kindled in Africa, where the Egyptians and Cushites, under the aegis of divine wisdom, erected monumental cities, their grandeur echoing through the ages. They wielded power with an iron grip, subjugating peoples, with Europeans, termed as 'Slavs,' shackled under their dominion.

The tale intertwines with the saga of Ham, bearer of esoteric knowledge passed down from Noah's wife, Naama. This arcane wisdom, a legacy shrouded in mystery, bestowed upon Ham's lineage the mantle of rulership, elevating them as the architects of urban magnificence. Yet, amidst this grandeur lurks a curse, a shadow cast by Noah upon Canaan, condemning him to be the "servant of servants," a foreshadowing of a world where the chains of servitude bind the fabric of societies.

This narrative weaves a tapestry of power, where the erstwhile enslaved ascend to mastery, inverting the very essence of servitude. It is a saga of perpetual conflict, a testament to the relentless struggle for supremacy, where the divine lineage of the Annunaki continues to echo through the corridors of time, a perpetual reminder of the celestial origins of human strife and sovereignty.

So help me reason this out as well. Yahweh also describes loving a people and seeing them at birth and caring for them nurturing a wife basically. But she became unfaithful, going after the other gods who haven’t even been given the dominion and are no gods. This seems to be after there are many peoples on the Earth, which doesn’t differentiated from the genesis 6 story because it specifically says when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth so I suppose they could reference the same time. So it may indicate a stepping out of line of certain figures who are not authorized wow, Yahweh is the authorized ruler of the Earth, and Yahweh chose out of those people the people to mold into his pride and joy that work, to represent him and his rulership over the entire earth.  So this will be a separate driving force then the original ones who had the knowledge or who were the sons of the annunaki. Or would this be the same people?

The narrative you're exploring delves into the complex interplay between divine beings and humanity, as depicted in various ancient texts, including the Bible. The portrayal of Yahweh as a nurturing figure who watches over a chosen people, likened to a spouse, is a poignant theme, especially in the context of unfaithfulness and idolatry.

The Genesis 6 account, which speaks of the "sons of God" intermingling with human women, is indeed a pivotal moment in biblical lore, marking a time when divine and human realms intersected in a profound way. This episode is often interpreted as a prelude to the Flood, a moment when divine displeasure with humanity's path reached its zenith.

The narrative of Yahweh's relationship with a chosen people, seen in various books of the Bible, notably in the prophetic books, metaphorically describes God's covenant with Israel. This relationship is often depicted as a marriage, where infidelity is represented by idolatry or the worship of other gods. The "other gods," despite being pursued by the unfaithful, lack the dominion and authority that Yahweh possesses, indicating a clear hierarchy in the divine order.

Your inquiry about whether these narratives describe the same group of people or separate ones is intriguing. On one hand, the "sons of God" from Genesis could be seen as distinct entities from Yahweh, possibly part of a broader divine council or pantheon, a concept found in various ancient Near Eastern religions. On the other hand, the biblical narrative often emphasizes the singularity and supremacy of Yahweh, especially in later texts, suggesting a monotheistic evolution in the understanding of God's nature and relationship with humanity.

The chosen people, nurtured and molded by Yahweh, are set apart to embody divine principles and represent Yahweh's rulership on Earth. This is distinct from the offspring of the union between the "sons of God" and human women, who are often portrayed as mighty beings or heroes of old but are not necessarily the same as the later chosen people.

In summary, while the Genesis account and the narratives of Yahweh's chosen people might share thematic elements of divine-human interaction, they seem to represent different aspects of the biblical understanding of the divine. The former focuses on a time of direct divine intervention and the mingling of heavenly and earthly beings, while the latter emphasizes a covenantal relationship, where fidelity and representation of divine authority on Earth are central themes.

Well, we still see that Israel has a husband wife relationship with Yahweh and an offspring to rule. Isn’t this like what happened in genesis 6? Says Elohim is plural. It does seems that there were more than one involved in the creation process. But yeah, always seems to have been the one who is given dominion as the true ruler, which would mean that there is no other god beside him meaning next to him or like/ equal to him. A sentiment any wife should have for her husband. That he is the true husband.

The metaphor of a husband-wife relationship between Yahweh and Israel is indeed a powerful motif in biblical literature, illustrating the intimate and covenantal bond that defines their connection. This relationship is characterized by love, commitment, and expectations of fidelity, paralleling the societal norms of marriage to express the depth of the divine-human relationship.

The Genesis 6 narrative, where the "sons of God" intermingle with human women, does echo this theme to some extent, as it also involves divine beings and their interactions with humanity. However, the nature of these interactions and their outcomes are vastly different. In Genesis 6, the union leads to the emergence of the Nephilim and precedes the chaos that brings about the Flood, whereas the relationship between Yahweh and Israel is meant to be an exemplar of righteousness and divine favor.

The term "Elohim" is indeed plural in Hebrew, which has led to various interpretations. Some see this as a vestige of polytheism or a divine council, while others interpret it as a plural of majesty, denoting the greatness and supremacy of God. When it comes to creation, the plural form could suggest the majesty and power of God, but the narrative consistently emphasizes the singularity of the creator's actions and intentions.

Yahweh's position as the "true ruler" in the biblical narrative does align with the sentiment that there should be no other gods "beside" or "equal to" Him. This is a recurring theme, especially in the context of Israel's frequent lapses into idolatry. Just as a wife in the metaphorical relationship is expected to remain faithful to her husband, Israel is expected to worship Yahweh alone, acknowledging no other gods as His equal or rival.

This exclusivity underscores Yahweh's unique covenant with Israel, distinguishing their relationship from the more transactional or capricious interactions between humans and the divine in other ancient Near Eastern contexts. It elevates the bond between Yahweh and Israel to a paradigm of loyalty, exclusivity, and divine purpose, setting it apart from the more ambiguous and often tumultuous divine-human entanglements depicted in the Genesis 6 narrative.

OK how does revelation describe the son of man who comes in the last days appearance

In the Book of Revelation, the "Son of Man" is described with vivid and symbolic imagery, reflecting his divine authority and majestic power. This figure is presented in a vision to John, the author of Revelation, and is laden with symbolic elements that convey his divinity and his role in the eschatological judgment and salvation.

Here's a detailed description from Revelation 1:13-16:

- **In the midst of the lampstands**: The Son of Man is seen standing among seven lampstands, which represent the seven churches to which the book is addressed.
  
- **Clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest**: This attire signifies dignity, authority, and a priestly role.

- **The hair of his head was white like wool, as white as snow**: This imagery suggests wisdom and agelessness, possibly echoing the Ancient of Days figure in Daniel 7:9, emphasizing purity and eternal authority.

- **His eyes were like a flame of fire**: This represents penetrating insight and judgment, indicating nothing is hidden from his sight.

- **His feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace**: This could symbolize strength, stability, and a foundation in righteousness, as well as the ability to execute judgment.

- **His voice was like the roar of many waters**: This imagery conveys the power and majesty of his words, echoing the authority of God's voice as described elsewhere in the Bible.

- **In his right hand, he held seven stars**: The stars represent the angels of the seven churches, showing his protection and authority over the churches.

- **From his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword**: This symbolizes the power of his word to judge and separate truth from falsehood.

- **His face was like the sun shining in full strength**: This reflects his glory and divine nature, indicating his overwhelming presence that outshines all else.

This portrayal is rich with symbolic meaning, each element contributing to a depiction of the Son of Man as a divine, authoritative figure who embodies wisdom, judgment, and sovereign power. The imagery aligns with the book's overall theme of revelation, judgment, and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.
