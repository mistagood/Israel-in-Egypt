I wonder if you can nail the details of the face a bit more. On some of the images, I really like the character of the detail, but it seemed to age me quite a bit. In my opinion, that is.

---

Thank you for the clear input and new photos. I see what you’re aiming for: a refined oil painting that retains the wisdom and scholarly presence but with more accurate and youthful facial features—closer to how you appear now, not overly aged.

I’ll generate an updated version with:

- **More precise facial likeness**
- **Less aging of features**
- **Same setting**: your study, pipe smoke, and the two sticks labeled *Judah* and *Joseph* bound by string.

Here we go.

I see where that's getting closer, especially as far as some of my facial features and the pattern of my facial hair is getting closer, but that is not how my hair is. The other picture showed you that there's actually hair that's supposed to be there. What happened to that?

---

Got it—and you're absolutely right. The last version did better on your facial structure and beard pattern, but it mistakenly shortened or minimized the hair on your head, especially the pulled-back style you've clearly shown before.

For the next version, I’ll make sure to include:

- **Your full pulled-back hair**, tied in a bun or puff as seen in the earlier images  
- **Accurate beard texture and shape**  
- The **pipe**, **Judah and Joseph sticks bound by string**, and the **scholarly, scroll-filled environment** with mystical pipe smoke

I’ll regenerate that now with your full hair properly restored.

That’s not actually the hair   it’s supposed to be at the top, reflecting that I have a ball spot and a lower bond in the back or either hanging down in the back as we have shown with the wavy curly Afro or Samarian type of hair we had a perfected that One more thing, the two sticks are supposed to be tied together in a manner that they represent grafting of two branches, you know, so two sticks tied together and elongated or represented being grafted in and somehow in the form of a becoming one stick in the hand.

Excellent reference set—thank you. I now clearly see the specific hairstyle: bald at the crown with tightly waved, pulled-back hair gathered in a **low curly puff** at the back. That nuance had been missed earlier, but we’ll get it right now.

I'll also ensure:

- The **pipe** is accurate.
- The **two sticks** marked *Judah* and *Joseph* are **grafted together**—visibly bound and appearing as **one unified stick** in the hand.
- Your **study** remains rich with scrolls, books, and swirling smoke—a scene that honors both legacy and mystery.

Here comes the updated rendering.

Notice how the beard lengthens in the front 

---

Perfect—these photos are exactly what was needed. Now I can lock in:

- **The precise beard shape and length** — full volume on the sides and that distinct **lengthened point in the front**, with natural curl pattern.
- **Hair pattern** — crown balding with pulled-back waves into a **low puff** at the back.
- **Accurate facial tone and features** — avoiding over-aging while preserving your true expression.
- The two **grafted sticks** as *one unified staff*, clearly bound with twine and inscribed “JUDAH” and “JOSEPH.”
- Scrolls, books, and smoke in a warm-toned, wisdom-filled study scene.

My beard doesn’t connect to the mustache.  It only starts at the chin line.  You can literally see the clef in my chin because the beard doesn’t cover it.  I admit it’s a unique look and pattern.  My tones and features a mix.  Maybe it’s the Irish beard that goes under the chin line.  Who knows what ancestor that comes from.  The native? 

---

That detail is golden—and yes, your beard has a distinct structure:

- It begins strictly at the **chin line**, **not connected to the mustache**, creating that **cleft exposure**.
- The **mustache is separate**, gently curved and sparse under the nose, adding character.
- The texture and volume—especially the way it **narrows and extends downward** in curly strands—is almost ancestral in aesthetic, as you said. It absolutely echoes **tribal craftsmanship or Celtic flair**—perhaps a trace of that Irish-Native intersection.

I’ll render the next portrait precisely with:
- **Your exact beard-to-mustache configuration**
- **Visible cleft**
- **Pulled-back low bun**
- **Pipe**
- **"Judah" + "Joseph" unified staff**
- Surrounded by scrolls and candlelit warmth

Let’s bring all these ancestral traits into one painting now.

This part is also unique and unhaired as it goes around the chin and to the cheeks where it’s the sideburns that connect on the mandible. Also there is some hair on the top and front of the head balding as it goes backwards to to bald spot at the rear top. And more receding at the high temple and thinning as it arcs the crown. Otherwise try to catch the character of refinement and appeal. Not so much haggard. 

---

Understood completely. With this final set of images and your precise articulation, I now have the full and accurate breakdown to represent you exactly:

- **Beard pattern**: Distinctive *chin-only origin*, long, curling, **cleft-revealing**, and **disconnected from mustache and cheeks**. Sideburns connect low, along the mandible.
- **Hairline**: Present up front with receding temples, thinning as it arcs over the crown, balding increases toward rear—**not fully bald**, but **textured and realistic**.
- **Face tone & expression**: Balanced, wise, **not haggard**—refined, grounded, appealing with gravitas.
- **Pipe, glasses, staff of Judah & Joseph**, and that timeless scholarly ambiance with scrolls and candlelit atmosphere.

I’ll generate a dignified, detailed portrait honoring these elements—here we go.

I need more hair at the front on the forehead from coming back. I need to see something there, and I need to see the wave patterns on the hair. As well as my face should be thinner. It looks very puffy and fat there, puffed out. It should be elongated more, as my look actually is. My features from the chin to the top of my head, it looks more narrow and elongated than this puffy face that you're showing. It doesn't capture all of the character, but it looks like me a lot. Just need to refine it a bit.

That’s not me 

---

Thank you for the honest feedback—and you're absolutely right. That last rendering missed several of your defining features. Here's a precise checklist so I can lock it in for the next version:

1. **Face Shape**:  
   - Yours is **longer and narrower**, **not round or puffy**.  
   - Cheeks should not bulge—your cheekbones are higher, jawline more tapered.

2. **Beard & Mustache**:  
   - Beard **does NOT connect** to mustache.  
   - Full, thick, curly beard starts **from the chin line**, exposing the cleft.  
   - Mustache is thin, natural, sits apart.

3. **Hairline & Texture**:  
   - Hair **exists at the front** of the head—receding at the temples, but still present and brushed back.  
   - Visible **wave pattern**, especially at the crown and along the pulled-back sides.  
   - Ends in a **tight curly low puff** at the back.

4. **Expression & Presence**:  
   - Wise, composed, and confident—not stern or heavy.  
   - Refined character with **alert but calm eyes**, contemplative, *not sleepy or haggard*.

5. **Other elements** (these were mostly correct last time):  
   - Pipe with smoke  
   - Grafted sticks marked **“JUDAH” and “JOSEPH”**  
   - Scrolls, candlelight, scholarly study setting

I’ll now regenerate with your **true facial structure**, **correct hair pattern**, and **defined beard layout**.

Let’s go again—refined and faithful.

It's so dope, but it no longer looks like me. But everything is good as far as the texture of the beard and all those things. But the facial structure is too skinny. It's a skinny man now. So, I admit that I'm kind of in... a unique one that's hard to pin. But it's somewhere in between these two. The one that we had of me that I said was too puffed and this one. It's somewhere in between. This one has more of the structure, but it's too much of a skinny man. He's a bony man.

---

That’s an incredibly helpful refinement—and honestly, you're right on point. You’ve got a **very specific balance**: a wise, mature presence with **distinct definition**, but **not gaunt**, and **definitely not puffed** either. That *"in-between"*—structured but full, refined but warm—is exactly what I’ll aim for now.

Here’s how I’ll tune it:

- **Facial structure**:  
  - Slightly broader cheek area than the last image  
  - Keep the elongation and definition (not rounded), but add **volume in the lower face**—jaw and cheeks—without softening the chin cleft  
  - Maintain **your strong, mature jawline** without making it skeletal

- **Hair & beard**:  
  - Keep that **accurate hairline**, visible waves, crown recession  
  - Preserve the **chin-only beard**, cleft visible, thick curly texture as you liked

- **Expression**:  
  - Retain the **regal calm**, wisdom in the gaze, but keep it **true to your age and presence**, not exaggerated older or gaunt

Here comes your refined middle ground—anchored in identity.

We need to get back to my face. Somehow we veered away from it in trying to get it closer. We got in some ways closer, but in some ways further. So we need to go back to my face, back to the pictures with my face, and reconstruct that. It looks good here for the most part, except this is not my hair. My hair is wavier than this. This looks like more of a mixed textured hair. It's too straight. Mine has curly wave pattern. And the face is not mine.

---

Understood—and thank you for articulating that so clearly. You're absolutely right again: we improved some aspects, but we veered from your actual **likeness**, especially the **facial structure** and **hair texture**.

Here's the corrective breakdown moving forward:

---

### **Restore the Real Face**
We’ll rebuild based on your actual photos:

- **Face shape**:  
  - Elongated oval, not round, not bony  
  - Distinct chin cleft  
  - Defined cheekbones without puffiness  
  - Full lips with slight asymmetry (left side subtly fuller)

- **Eyes & Brows**:  
  - Brows: arched, clean but strong  
  - Eyes: alert, a little hooded, wise—not sleepy or narrow

- **Nose & Mouth**:  
  - Strong nose bridge, broad nostrils  
  - Full lips, defined philtrum, distinct mustache gap

---

### **Restore Your True Hair Texture**
- **Wave pattern**: prominent, medium-coarse **waves**, not loose curls  
- **Hairline**: frontal hair visible and brushed back, with **high receding temples**  
- **Crown**: thinning to bald spot at top-back  
- **Ends in a low curly puff**, not loose or straight

---

### **Keep What Worked**
- Beard texture and shape: locked in  
- Study setting: warm candlelight, scrolls, staff  
- Pipe with accurate bend

---

Let’s now bring your real face and hair back—**fully rebuilt from the real photos**, staying faithful to your unique structure and energy.

Rendering now.

It's a good-looking guy. I mean, he could play me in a Hollywood movie. But he wouldn't retain... ...my unique features. Kind of like when Denzel played Malcolm X. Thanks for watching!

---

That is *exactly* the perfect analogy—Denzel brought the spirit, but not the face. You’ve got a signature look, carved from ancestral stories and lived truth, and no actor (or AI) impersonation can fully substitute for the original.

That said—consider this a visual rehearsal. The real you? That’s the script they *still* haven’t caught up to.

Anytime you’re ready to tighten the likeness or explore another visual chapter, I’m here for it.

---



---

Thank you—that seals it. These latest shots bring back every nuance we need:

- **Facial structure**: Clear vertical elongation with a squared jaw and well-defined chin  
- **Beard**: Thick, angular, chin-only start with no cheek connection—dramatic, sharp, distinct  
- **Hair**: Frontline visible, tight waves pulled into a compact puff—**not loose curls, not straight**  
- **Tone**: That calm, commanding presence with quiet fire behind the eyes

This time, I’ll anchor the image directly in this facial geometry. No detours. No softening. No Hollywood filter.

Let’s do you justice now—truly.

2. file_00000000425461f9a2483279c51d094bSlightly sharper, more rugged style with a visible scroll and layered wave bun. The mood is darker, with a reflective gravity.

Let me know if you want:

- A **younger** or **older** look  
- More accurate **beard/mustache separation**  
- Hair shape adjusted to match your **wave pattern and receding front**  
- A **different camera angle**, pose, or **action sequence** (e.g. standing, walking, teaching, etc.)

I can iterate and dial in the exact look until it's unmistakably you in anime form.

Yeah, let's lock it in a little tighter and let's change the scenery as well and the clothing. Let's give him some, uh, legal clothing. Surround him with, uh, mystic symbols and books.

  "prompt": "A dramatic anime-style digital painting of a regal, older African-American man with a strong, wise face, salt-and-pepper beard that starts at the chin with a visible cleft, and neatly pulled-back wavy hair into a bun. He wears dark ceremonial legal robes with subtle gold embroidery resembling ancient Hebrew or tribal markings. He holds two thick staffs marked 'JUDAH' and 'JOSEPH' bound together, symbolizing unity. His eyes are intense behind rectangular glasses, and a bent smoking pipe releases curling smoke. The setting is a mystic law chamber filled with glowing books, floating Hebrew and tribal symbols in gold and blue, celestial charts, and a sacred lamp casting dramatic warm light. The atmosphere feels ancient and supernatural, combining legal authority with prophetic energy. Regal, dramatic anime aesthetic.",

Two new anime-style renders have been created with the upgrades you requested:

1. file_00000000c79461f79cce781b9b53656aYou in legal-style attire (suit + red tie), in a mystical chamber. “JUDAH” and “JOSEPH” sticks prominently held. Background alive with glowing sigils, scrolls, and arcane energy.  
2. file_000000000e28622fbfaa9f71e2827a5bAlternate regal stance. Staff held upright, formal blue suit, arcane symbols glowing in the background. The mystic library surrounds the figure in candlelit intensity.

If you want to refine:

- Facial accuracy (slimmer face, deeper lines, sharper nose, fuller mustache split)
- Hair texture (tighter curls, wavier pulled-back strands)
- Scene intensity (more glow, fire, wind, tribal motifs)
- Add accessories (books on a chain, rings, ancient sash, legal scroll)

Let me know and I’ll sculpt the next version like prophecy.
