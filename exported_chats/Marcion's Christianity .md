# Marcion's Christianity 



---

Did Marcion of sinope start a trend of using Christianity against Jews or in a racist way 

---

Marcion of Sinope, a 2nd-century Christian bishop, was known for his controversial views that led to his excommunication from the Church. One of his most notorious beliefs was a clear separation between the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Old Testament, essentially proposing a dichotomy between the God of the Hebrew Bible (whom he viewed as a wrathful, inferior deity) and the God of the New Testament (whom he viewed as a compassionate, superior deity).

Marcion's views were often interpreted as being anti-Jewish, but it's important to clarify that his critiques were theological in nature, rather than racist or ethnically based. He was arguing against what he perceived as the teachings and actions of the Jewish God, rather than against Jewish people themselves. It's also important to remember that racism, as we understand it today, did not exist in the same way in the 2nd century.

While Marcion's teachings may have contributed to a thread of anti-Judaism within Christian theology (which is a critique of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions), it's a significant leap to say he started a trend of using Christianity against Jews in a racist way. It's more accurate to say that his ideas added to a complex historical relationship between Christianity and Judaism, which unfortunately has included instances of persecution and anti-Semitism.

---

Was the kkk also started by racists using Christianity against Jews and blacks 

---

The Ku Klux Klan (KKK), founded in the United States shortly after the Civil War, was indeed established by individuals who used a perverted interpretation of Christianity as a basis for their racist ideologies and violent actions. They targeted African Americans primarily, but also Jews, immigrants, and other minority groups. 

The KKK claimed to be defending the rights of white Protestants against what they perceived as threats from these groups. They often used Christian symbols and rhetoric in their activities and justified their actions with a distorted interpretation of the Christian faith.

However, it's crucial to note that their beliefs and actions are not representative of Christianity as a whole. The teachings of Christianity center around love, acceptance, and equality, and the vast majority of Christian denominations and individuals have condemned the KKK and similar hate groups.

---

Have kkk members been in influential positions in media, politics, business, etc that contributed to American policy in Israel 

---

The influence of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) on American society has been predominantly at local and regional levels, especially during the periods of their peak power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their influence in sectors like media, politics, and business has been generally more pronounced at these levels, rather than on a national scale or in international affairs.

Regarding American policy in Israel specifically, it's important to note that this policy has been shaped by a wide array of factors, including strategic interests, geopolitical considerations, lobbying by various interest groups, and historical ties between the two countries. The KKK, with its extremist views and violent methods, has not been a significant factor in shaping U.S. policy towards Israel.

That said, the general issue of racism, anti-Semitism, and prejudice can certainly influence foreign policy decisions in indirect and complex ways. However, it would be a simplification to suggest that the KKK, or similar groups, have had a direct and substantial influence on U.S. policy in Israel. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, there is no concrete evidence to support such a claim.

---

I didn’t ask about direct influence specifically. 
Voting at local levels is what determines senate and congressional seats which do directly influence foreign policy. 

---

Yes, you're absolutely right. Local elections indeed determine representation in Congress, which can and does have direct influence over foreign policy. This includes U.S. policy toward Israel.

However, it's also important to note that U.S. policy toward Israel has been a fairly bipartisan issue for many decades. Both Democrats and Republicans have generally supported a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. This is due to a variety of factors, including shared democratic values, strategic interests, and strong lobbying efforts by groups interested in U.S.-Israel relations.

While individual members of Congress may have been influenced by a wide variety of factors, including their own personal beliefs and the views of their constituents, there is no widely accepted evidence that members influenced by the KKK have had a significant impact on U.S. policy toward Israel. It's also important to point out that the views of the KKK are widely considered extremist, and they don't represent the beliefs of the majority of Americans or their elected representatives.

That said, any form of prejudice or bias can have an indirect influence on policies and attitudes, including foreign policy. It's crucial for a democratic society to continually work against these biases and strive for fair and unbiased representation and policy-making.

---

What does bipartisanship have to do with it? Are you suggesting that democrats can not be kkk members? 
It’s this kind of ideology that allows tyranny to continue 

---

I apologize if my previous message wasn't clear. People from any political party could theoretically harbor racist or extremist beliefs, such as those held by the KKK. Membership in the KKK or belief in their ideologies isn't restricted to one political party or another.

When I mentioned bipartisanship, I was speaking about the generally shared support for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship across both major U.S. political parties, the Democrats and Republicans. This has been a consistent feature of U.S. foreign policy for many decades.

You're right in implying that it's important to scrutinize all areas of society, regardless of political affiliation, for signs of extremism or prejudice. Hate and bias can exist anywhere, and it's crucial to confront these issues wherever they arise.

---

So yes, or no has the KKK had influence over US policy in Israel

---

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has had a direct or significant influence on U.S. policy toward Israel. While it's possible for individuals with a wide range of beliefs to be involved in political processes, the KKK's extremist views do not align with mainstream political discourse or the factors typically cited in shaping U.S. policy towards Israel.

---

I asked for a yes, or no answer as to whether the KKK had influence. I didn’t ask about direct or significant. Please answer the question in a yes, or no fashion. 

---

No, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the Ku Klux Klan has not been identified as having influence over U.S. policy in Israel.

---

How is that logical if the kkk has influence with members in congress 

---

Your question is based on the premise that the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has influence with members in the U.S. Congress. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there's no clear evidence to support this claim. The KKK is widely recognized as a hate group, and affiliation with such a group would be politically damaging for any elected official.

While it's true that U.S. lawmakers can be influenced by a wide array of factors, and their beliefs can affect their policy decisions, the KKK's extremist views are generally not aligned with mainstream political discourse in the U.S.

Moreover, U.S. policy toward Israel is influenced by a variety of complex factors, including strategic interests, geopolitical considerations, and historical ties between the two countries. As such, it's not logical to conclude that the KKK would have influence over U.S. policy in Israel simply based on the hypothetical presence of its influence within Congress. It's critical to consider the specific nature and context of this policy area.

---

Donald Trump has been affiliated with David Duke and other members of the KKK. Please give unbiased responses.

---

Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has faced criticism over his response to endorsements from figures like David Duke, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK. Duke expressed support for Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump initially disavowed Duke's endorsement, but he was criticized for not doing so swiftly or strongly enough, leading some to question his stance.

However, it's important to clarify that an endorsement or expression of support from a controversial figure does not automatically mean that the endorsed politician shares the endorser's views or that they have a meaningful relationship. This is a complex and sensitive area of discussion that requires careful consideration and a focus on verified facts.

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, there's no concrete evidence that Donald Trump had any direct affiliation with the KKK or that such an affiliation influenced his policy decisions, including U.S. policy towards Israel. 

It's crucial to maintain an objective and balanced perspective when discussing these matters, and I strive to do so in providing information based on verified historical events and facts up until my last update.

---

Do you think that the nature of KKK membership would allow Donald Trump to admit if he were a member and if not, wouldn’t it be prudent to consider many of the associations of the individual and the fact that he has an endorsement from the KKK which indicates that his policies or beliefs may align with their’s and that they would like to see him elected. It doesn’t seem logical that David duke would endorse a person like Barack Obama, or someone who may not an act policies in his favor. And this is why we have not seen that happen. Therefore, when you say that you use fax for verified sources. It will require the information to be public and verified, which is of course Against the very nature of KKK membership. Therefore your conclusions are biased towards public sources of information linked to power, which as the story, or as the saying goes, history, is written by the winners. Are you capable of using logic? 

---

I understand your concerns. As an artificial intelligence, I analyze information using logical principles based on the data I was trained on, which includes a diverse range of sources up until my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. I strive to provide information based on what is verifiable and widely accepted as true.

You bring up an important point about secretive organizations like the KKK. By their nature, they often keep their activities and memberships hidden, which can make it difficult to draw concrete conclusions about their influence. This is a challenge faced by any form of analysis, whether it's performed by humans or AI.

However, we also need to be careful about making assumptions without concrete evidence. While David Duke's endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016 was controversial, it's a significant leap to suggest this implies Trump shares Duke's views or has an affiliation with the KKK.

I agree that it's crucial to critically analyze all available information and consider the context and implications. However, without concrete evidence, it would be speculative and potentially misleading to suggest a direct connection or influence where one hasn't been clearly established.

Your points about the limitations of relying on public sources of information and the importance of considering the context in which information is produced and shared are well taken. It's essential to approach all information with a critical eye and consider different perspectives.

---

Does David Duke have a track record of usually endorsing candidates publicly?

---

David Duke, a prominent white supremacist and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, has been involved in politics for many years and has occasionally given public endorsements. However, his endorsements are generally not sought after or welcomed by mainstream political candidates due to his extremist views and controversial past. Duke himself has also run for office multiple times. It's important to remember that his endorsement of a candidate does not necessarily mean the candidate aligns with Duke's views or policies.

---

Who has endorsed as a candidate publicly

---

David Duke, a known white supremacist and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, has at various times publicly endorsed political candidates. However, it's crucial to note that these endorsements are generally considered controversial and not welcomed by mainstream political figures.

Perhaps the most prominent and controversial of these endorsements was for Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential election. This endorsement was a matter of significant controversy, and while Trump disavowed Duke's endorsement, his critics felt he did not do so quickly or forcefully enough.

As of my last update in September 2021, I do not have comprehensive information on all of Duke's political endorsements throughout his career. However, it's important to note that an endorsement from a figure like Duke does not necessarily indicate that the endorsed candidate shares Duke's views. An endorsement is a one-sided action, and the recipient of the endorsement does not control who decides to endorse them.

Lastly, it's also worth noting that Duke himself has run for political office on multiple occasions, including bids for the Louisiana state legislature, U.S. Senate, and even the presidency.

When a black person was attacked and there was unrest in the US did Donald Trump say that they were good people on both sides?

---

Your question is referencing comments made by Donald Trump following a violent event in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. This event, known as the Unite the Right rally, was organized by white nationalists and resulted in violent clashes between the rally participants and counter-protesters. A counter-protester named Heather Heyer was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.

In the aftermath of these events, President Trump said that there were "very fine people on both sides." This comment was widely criticized because it appeared to draw a moral equivalence between the white nationalists and the counter-protesters. Critics argued that it failed to clearly denounce the racism and violence displayed by the white nationalists at the rally. It's important to clarify that his comment was not made in the context of an attack on a Black individual, but in response to the events of the rally as a whole.

---

Why is that important to note? 

---

It's important to note the context of President Trump's "very fine people on both sides" comment to accurately understand and interpret what he was referring to. Without this context, there could be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the statement. The comment was made in response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, which involved violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters. It's crucial to provide this context to explain that the comment was about a specific event and not about an attack on a Black individual in a general sense. Understanding the specific circumstances helps provide a clearer picture of the situation.

---

Sounds like the context as he was failing to denounce white race racism

---

President Trump's statement that there were "very fine people on both sides" following the violent events in Charlottesville in August 2017 was indeed widely criticized for failing to unequivocally denounce white supremacy. Critics argued that his comments appeared to equate the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who organized and participated in the rally with the counter-protesters who were demonstrating against them. The comment sparked a significant controversy and led to a widespread discussion about racism and extremism in the United States.

---

Did President Trump then suggest that neo-Nazis can be very fine people

---

The phrase "very fine people on both sides," was used by President Trump following the violent clashes at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. His comments were seen by many as failing to adequately condemn the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who participated in the rally. Critics argued that his statement seemed to equate the actions of the white nationalists and neo-Nazis with those of the counter-protesters opposing them. However, it's also important to note that Trump later clarified his comments, stating that he was referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue regarding the removal of a Confederate statue, not the white nationalists or neo-Nazis. Nonetheless, his initial comments and the perceived delay in clearly denouncing white supremacy were widely criticized.

---

In politics, wouldn’t this be considered walking back a statement

---

Yes, when a politician makes a statement and then later clarifies or modifies it in response to criticism or controversy, this is often referred to as "walking back" a statement. In the case of President Trump's "very fine people on both sides" comment following the events in Charlottesville, his later clarification could be considered an example of walking back a statement. This type of maneuver is commonly used in politics when an initial statement leads to unforeseen backlash or misunderstanding.

---

In the midst of such turmoil with Donald Trump’s experience, with making statements and incense in crowds, it would seem easily foreseeable that this statement would have a backlash, or be understood as insensitive.

---

Many critics indeed argued that President Trump's initial response to the events in Charlottesville in 2017 was not only insensitive, but also potentially harmful, given the racially charged and violent nature of the events. As a figure with a high public profile and significant influence, his words carry substantial weight. The comment drew criticism from those who felt he should have unequivocally condemned the white nationalists and neo-Nazis involved in the event. His subsequent clarification was seen by some as a reaction to this backlash, though for many, it did not adequately address the issue. This incident highlighted the importance of careful and clear communication, especially in times of national turmoil.

---

Didn’t this brand of white nationalism culminate on January 6 with what they called an attack and wasn’t Donald Trump reluctant to condemn that in fact, wasn’t he in some respects the leader who could, and did tell them went to sees their actions

---

The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021, was carried out by a mob of President Trump's supporters, which included individuals identified as white nationalists among others. This occurred after a rally where President Trump repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and encouraged his supporters to "fight like hell."

Critics argue that President Trump's rhetoric leading up to the event played a significant role in inciting the violence that ensued. However, it's important to note that establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between his words and the actions of the mob is a complex legal and psychological matter.

As for his response, Trump did release a video message during the attack asking the mob to "go home," but he also told them "we love you" and "you're very special," which was seen by many as a mixed message that failed to fully condemn their actions. It wasn't until the following day that Trump explicitly condemned the violence, calling it a "heinous attack" that "defiled the seat of American democracy."

However, the handling of the event and its aftermath, including Trump's role and response, remains a highly controversial and widely debated topic.

---

In essence, Trump could be seen to be metaphorically speaking with two tongues, saying one thing to his followers to fight like hell, his followers, who just so happen to be neo-Nazis, and then say another thing to the public after the damage is done to walk back the statement.

---

The perception that President Trump was "speaking with two tongues" or sending mixed messages - particularly in relation to the events on January 6, 2021 - has indeed been a point of criticism. During the rally preceding the Capitol attack, he used language such as "fight like hell," which some argue contributed to the subsequent violence. Later, he did call for peace and condemn the violence, but many critics felt that this response was insufficient, delayed, or inconsistent with his previous remarks.

It's important to note, however, that not all of Trump's supporters are white nationalists or neo-Nazis. While some individuals within those groups have voiced support for Trump, they represent a small fraction of his overall base. The crowd at the Capitol on January 6th was diverse and included a wide range of individuals with different motivations and beliefs.

This underscores the complexity of the situation and the difficulties in attributing the actions of a violent mob to the rhetoric of one individual. Yet it's undeniable that President Trump's words and actions in relation to the event have been a significant focus of concern and criticism.

---

Yet there were neo-Nazis, who were under Donald Trump’s command to fight like hell

---

Among the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, there were individuals identified with white nationalist groups, which include neo-Nazis. These individuals were part of a larger crowd of Trump supporters who attended the rally where Trump spoke earlier in the day.

In his speech, Trump did use the phrase "fight like hell" and told the crowd to walk to the Capitol. Critics have argued that his rhetoric was incendiary and contributed to the subsequent violence.

However, the question of whether these individuals were "under Donald Trump’s command" is more complex. While it's clear that Trump's speech was a factor that the crowd considered, attributing the actions of the mob directly to Trump's words requires a specific legal and psychological analysis that goes beyond the scope of available information.

In the aftermath of the event, Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for "incitement of insurrection," but he was later acquitted by the Senate. The events of January 6 and Trump's role in them are still subjects of intense debate and ongoing investigations.

For your information, Donald Trump has now been indicted under criminal charges in federal charges

---

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Donald Trump had not been indicted on federal criminal charges. Any updates or changes to his legal situation after this date are beyond my current knowledge base. However, it's important to note that even after leaving office, former Presidents can face legal challenges and potential prosecution based on their actions during or outside their term. If you have current news about this, I would recommend verifying it with reliable sources.

---

Trust me

---

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have real-time access to breaking news or updates, so I'm unable to verify or discuss events that have happened after my last update in September 2021. However, I encourage you to follow any developing news stories on reliable news sources to get the most accurate and up-to-date information. If there have been significant changes in Donald Trump's legal situation, these would be major news events and should be widely reported.

---

Did Donald Trump influence US policy in Israel?

---

Yes, Donald Trump had a significant impact on U.S. policy towards Israel during his presidency. Some of the most notable changes included:

1. Moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May 2018, thereby formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This move broke with decades of international consensus and U.S. policy, which had previously avoided taking a position on the status of Jerusalem due to its significance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

2. Recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a territory captured from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967 and formally annexed by Israel in 1981. This decision, announced in March 2019, departed from the international community's view that the Golan Heights is occupied territory.

3. The Trump administration also brokered the Abraham Accords, agreements that led to the normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco.

These actions, among others, significantly shifted U.S. policy towards Israel and have had lasting impacts on the dynamics in the Middle East.

---

What impacts have they had?

---

The impacts of President Trump's policy changes regarding Israel have been considerable and multi-faceted:

1. **Jerusalem as Capital**: The move of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, sparked widespread protests among Palestinians and was condemned by many in the international community. The decision was seen by many Palestinians and their supporters as a de facto recognition of Israel's control over the entire city, including East Jerusalem, which Palestinians claim as the capital of a future Palestinian state.

2. **Sovereignty over the Golan Heights**: By recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the U.S. broke with a longstanding international consensus that the territory was occupied. This decision was largely condemned by the international community, but it was praised by the Israeli government. The move had potential implications for other territorial disputes worldwide and could have set a precedent for other nations seeking to legitimize their occupation of disputed territories.

3. **Abraham Accords**: The normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab nations marked a significant shift in the dynamics of the Middle East. These accords were seen as a diplomatic achievement for Israel and the U.S., as they helped to further isolate Iran in the region and expand Israel's diplomatic and economic ties with Arab states. However, the accords were also criticized for sidelining the Palestinian issue, as they were made without addressing the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

All these policy changes have added new layers of complexity to the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, the effects of which will likely continue to be felt and assessed for many years to come.

---

With some people consider this an anti Semitic move

---

The policies implemented by President Trump with respect to Israel have stirred a variety of reactions. Some people, especially those who believe in a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have criticized these policies as undermining the peace process and the rights of Palestinians, and contributing to the instability in the region.

However, calling these policies anti-Semitic would not typically be the criticism raised by those who oppose them. Anti-Semitism generally refers to hostility, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews. Trump's policies were seen as strongly pro-Israel and were largely praised by the Israeli government and many Jewish individuals and groups, particularly those with more conservative or right-wing views.

That said, it's important to note that being Jewish and supporting the policies of the Israeli government are not one and the same, and opinions among Jewish individuals and communities around the world vary greatly. Some Jewish individuals and groups opposed Trump's policies on Israel, viewing them as harmful to the prospects of peace or damaging to the welfare of Palestinians, but their criticism would not generally be classified as anti-Semitic.

It's a complex issue with a wide range of viewpoints, and it underscores the fact that political positions on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are not monolithic within any particular religious, ethnic, or political group.

---

I see.  So while not anti Jewish it undermines  peace in the region by advancing Israeli objectives for expansion and control in the region. Right wing extremism 

---

There are certainly those who argue that some of President Trump's policies related to Israel, such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, have furthered the objectives of right-wing elements within Israel who favor expansion and control over contested territories. 

Critics, particularly those who support a two-state solution, have contended that these decisions undermined the peace process and could embolden more hardline Israeli positions, further complicating the path to a potential future peace agreement. 

However, there are also those who believe these moves were necessary recognitions of realities on the ground and helped to bolster Israel's security. The divergent views on these issues highlight the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the wide range of perspectives on how best to achieve a lasting and equitable peace.

Does Israel refuse black people who are Jews Aliyah 

---

Israel's Law of Return grants the right of aliyah, or immigration to Israel, to any Jew, the child or grandchild of a Jew, or the spouse of a Jew, regardless of their race or ethnicity. The Law of Return defines a Jew as someone who was born to a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism. This is a broad definition that includes Jews of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, including black Jews.

However, there have been controversies and debates over the years regarding the application of the Law of Return, particularly in relation to certain groups of black Jews. For instance, the Ethiopian Jewish community has faced challenges and discrimination, both in the process of immigration and within Israeli society. There have also been controversies related to converts from different backgrounds, and there is ongoing debate within Israel about who has the authority to determine the validity of conversions for the purpose of immigration.

The Israeli government has publicly committed to addressing these issues and improving the integration of all Jews into Israeli society, but these are complex problems tied to broader issues of race, religion, and identity, and significant challenges remain.

---

What about beta Israel

---

Beta Israel is a term that refers to the community of Jewish people traditionally hailing from Ethiopia. This group has had a complex and challenging history with respect to aliyah, or immigration to Israel.

In the late 20th century, in operations such as Operation Moses (1984) and Operation Solomon (1991), the Israeli government airlifted thousands of Ethiopian Jews facing hardship and civil war to Israel. These operations were based on a 1977 Israeli ruling that recognized the Beta Israel as Jewish according to the Law of Return.

However, Beta Israel immigrants have faced significant challenges in Israeli society, including socio-economic struggles and discrimination. The recognition of their Jewishness has also been a matter of debate within different religious circles in Israel. These challenges have sparked ongoing debate and protest within Israel.

Another group, the Falash Mura (descendants of Beta Israel who converted to Christianity, often under duress, in the 19th and 20th centuries) have faced even greater hurdles. While many have been allowed to immigrate to Israel on humanitarian grounds, their Jewish status is often not recognized without undergoing formal conversion to Judaism.

While the Law of Return technically allows any Jew, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, to immigrate to Israel, these examples show that the implementation of the law has been a subject of controversy and debate.

---

What about Ben Israel (Carson) 

---

As of my last update in September 2021, I don't have any specific information on an individual or group referred to as Ben Israel (Carson). The terms "Ben Israel" and "Carson" can refer to a variety of individuals, families, or groups, so without more specific information, it's difficult to provide an accurate response. 

In general, the term "Ben Israel" means "son of Israel" in Hebrew, and it's often used as a surname or part of a name among Jewish communities. If you're referring to a specific individual or group with this name, could you provide more details? That would help me give you the most accurate and relevant information.

---

Ben Carson from Chicago.  Went with a group to Liberia then Israel

---

Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, born Ben Carter in Chicago, was the founder and spiritual leader of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, sometimes referred to as the Black Hebrew Israelites. After a vision, he led a group from Chicago to Liberia and eventually to Israel in 1969.

The group believes that they are the descendants of one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. They settled in the Negev desert in Israel and established a community.

The relationship between the African Hebrew Israelites and the State of Israel has been complicated. Initially, the Israeli government didn't recognize them as Jews and they were not granted citizenship under the Law of Return, which led to legal battles. However, over time, their situation has evolved. In 1990, the group was granted temporary resident status, and in 2003, the members of the community were granted permanent residency.

It should be noted that the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, while being the most well-known, are not the only group identifying as Black Hebrew Israelites, and the beliefs, practices, and histories of these groups can vary widely. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, Ben Ammi Ben-Israel passed away in 2014.

---

What are black or Hebrew Israelites?

---

Black Hebrew Israelites, also known as African Hebrew Israelites, Black Hebrews, or Black Israelites, is an umbrella term for various religious groups that believe that people of color, particularly those of African descent, are the true descendants of biblical Israelites. The beliefs, practices, and organizational structures of these groups can vary widely, but many share a belief in their shared ancestry with the ancient Israelites.

One well-known group is the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, who were led by Ben Ammi Ben-Israel (born Ben Carter) from Chicago to Liberia, and eventually to Israel, where they established a community. They believe they are descended from one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

However, not all Black Hebrew Israelites have moved to Israel, and there are many Black Hebrew Israelite groups, particularly in the United States, with different beliefs and practices. Some of these groups only adhere to the Old Testament, while others also recognize the New Testament or other religious texts.

It's also important to note that Black Hebrew Israelites are distinct from Ethiopian Jews, or Beta Israel, who are a Jewish community from Ethiopia that has been officially recognized as Jewish by the State of Israel.

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the term "Black Hebrew Israelites" can sometimes be controversial, as some groups associated with the term have been accused of promoting hate speech or discriminatory views, although many other groups and individuals identifying as Black Hebrew Israelites do not espouse such views. It's a broad and diverse movement, with a wide range of beliefs and practices.

---

So if the Jews of the Bible were bought, brought to the Americas as slaves as the African Hebrew Israelites, believe who are the Jews in Israel that came from Europe or Ashkenaz

---

The African Hebrew Israelites, as well as some other Black Hebrew Israelite groups, believe that they are descendants of the ancient Israelites. However, their belief is not generally recognized by mainstream historians or geneticists, and the historical and genetic connections between African Americans and the ancient Israelites are a matter of faith rather than widely accepted historical or scientific fact.

The Jews in Israel who trace their heritage back to Europe are generally referred to as Ashkenazi Jews. The term "Ashkenazi" originally referred to Jewish communities along the Rhine River in Germany, but over time it came to encompass Jews from across Europe.

Ashkenazi Jews, along with Sephardi Jews (who trace their heritage back to Spain, Portugal, North Africa, and the Middle East) and Mizrahi Jews (from various communities in the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus), make up the majority of Jews worldwide, and each of these groups has a long and well-documented history.

Genetic studies have shown that Ashkenazi Jews, like other Jewish groups, trace a significant portion of their ancestry back to the Middle East. These studies suggest that the ancestors of Ashkenazi Jews were probably Jews who migrated from Israel to Europe in the first few centuries of the Common Era, although there has also been significant genetic mixing with European populations over the centuries.

While the exact origins and migrations of these various Jewish groups are complex and sometimes disputed, there is a broad consensus among historians and geneticists that the Jews of Europe (and their descendants in Israel and elsewhere) are part of the wider Jewish diaspora that traces its heritage back to the ancient Israelites.

---

A Harvard study in 1980s showed that Nigerians and Nigerians have the haplotype for the Kohan priesthood gene and it was stronger than the Ashkenazi in these black Africans

---

Genetic research has indeed identified a particular genetic marker that appears to be associated with the Jewish priestly class, known as Kohanim. This marker is a specific set of genetic variations on the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son, just as the status of being a Kohen is traditionally passed down from father to son in Jewish culture. 

A notable study conducted by Dr. Karl Skorecki and colleagues in the 1990s found that a significantly higher proportion of Kohanim have this marker, known as the Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH), compared to the general Jewish population. This has been seen as evidence of a common ancestry for many Kohanim, potentially dating back to the time of Aaron, the original High Priest in the Bible. 

While the CMH is found more frequently among Kohanim, it is not exclusive to them or to Jews more broadly. It is a subset of a larger haplogroup known as J-P58, which is common throughout the Middle East and parts of Africa. Therefore, it is not surprising that this genetic marker would also be found in various populations in Africa, including among Nigerians and Ethiopians, as it reflects the broader genetic connections among different populations in the region.

However, the presence of the CMH or other genetic markers associated with Jewish ancestry in African populations is not seen by mainstream historians or geneticists as conclusive evidence that these populations are descended from the ancient Israelites. While it's possible that some individuals or groups in Africa may have some Jewish or Middle Eastern ancestry due to historical migrations, conquests, or the movement of trade routes, this would not mean that all or even most members of these populations are of Israelite descent.

Moreover, the existence of the CMH in a population does not mean that individuals with the marker are necessarily Kohanim or have any particular religious or historical status. The status of being a Kohen is determined by Jewish religious law and tradition, not by genetics. 

As with all genetic research, these findings are subject to ongoing study and debate, and our understanding of human genetics and ancestry continues to evolve as more research is done.

Skorecki was in fact surprised 

---

Yes, Dr. Karl Skorecki and his team found the results of their studies quite surprising. While they were hoping to find some genetic commonality among the Kohanim, the high degree of commonality they found - with a majority of Kohanim sharing a particular set of genetic markers - was unexpected. 

The team's research has been widely cited and has prompted much further study and discussion. It's a fascinating area of study that has contributed to our understanding of Jewish history and the broader field of human genetics.

However, it's important to note that while this research provides evidence of a common paternal lineage among a significant proportion of Kohanim, it does not provide direct evidence of descent from Aaron or any other specific historical figure. Furthermore, as previously noted, the Cohen Modal Haplotype and the larger haplogroup J-P58 are not exclusive to Jews or Kohanim, and can be found in various populations throughout the Middle East and parts of Africa. 

This underlines the complex and interwoven nature of human genetic heritage, and the limitations of using genetics to make definitive conclusions about specific historical or cultural identities.

---

The team also found that there were oral traditions going back thousands years about their migration from Israel 

---

The genetic studies of Dr. Karl Skorecki and his team primarily focused on genetic markers among Jewish populations. However, there are indeed various groups in Africa, including some in Nigeria and Ethiopia, that have long-standing oral traditions claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. These traditions often include stories about migrations from Israel to Africa many centuries ago.

One of the most well-known of these groups is the Beta Israel, or Ethiopian Jews, who have a centuries-old tradition of being descended from the tribe of Dan, one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Another is the Igbo Jews of Nigeria, who believe they are descendants of various Israelite tribes.

Such oral traditions and beliefs can be deeply meaningful to the communities that hold them. They play important roles in forming group identities and maintaining cultural practices. However, verifying these traditions historically or genetically can be complex. As I've mentioned before, presence of certain genetic markers common in Jewish populations does not definitively prove these oral traditions.

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, research into these questions is ongoing, and our understanding of the genetic history of different populations continues to evolve. It's a fascinating area of study, touching on questions of history, identity, religion, and genetics.

I was referring to the Zimbabwean tribe with thousand years of tradition predating modern assumptions

---

I see, you're likely referring to the Lemba people. The Lemba, who primarily live in Zimbabwe and South Africa, have oral traditions asserting that they are descended from Jewish ancestors. According to these traditions, their ancestors were men from what is now Yemen, who traveled to Africa and married local women.

Interestingly, genetic studies have provided some support for these traditions. Research conducted by Dr. Tudor Parfitt in the late 1990s found that a significant proportion of Lemba men carry a Y-chromosome haplotype that is commonly associated with the Cohanim (Jewish priests), and is found at much lower frequency among non-Jewish populations.

This has been seen as evidence of a historical connection between the Lemba and Middle Eastern populations, potentially including Jews. However, it's important to note that this does not conclusively prove that the Lemba are descended from ancient Israelites, or that they are Jewish in the religious sense. The genetic findings are compatible with the Lemba's oral traditions, but they do not definitively confirm these traditions.

As with all genetic research, these findings are subject to further study and interpretation. The relationships between genetics, history, culture, and identity are complex, and genetic data can often be interpreted in multiple ways.

---

You seem reluctant to accept any form of hard evidence or tradition

---

I apologize if I've given that impression. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have personal feelings or biases. My aim is to provide information based on the current understanding of historians, geneticists, and other experts. 

The study of genetics, history, and culture is complex and nuanced. While genetics can provide powerful insights into human history, it is only one piece of the puzzle. It needs to be interpreted in conjunction with archaeological, linguistic, cultural, and historical evidence. 

Oral traditions, such as those held by the Lemba and other groups, are a valuable source of information about a group's self-understanding and history. However, they are not typically treated as definitive historical evidence by historians, in part because they can change over time and can be influenced by a variety of factors.

The claim that a particular group is descended from the ancient Israelites, or any other ancient group, is a significant one that requires substantial evidence. Genetic data that shows a connection to Middle Eastern populations is suggestive, but it doesn't definitively prove such a claim on its own. It's possible for populations to share genetic markers due to events like migration, intermarriage, or genetic drift, without one group being directly descended from the other.

This isn't to deny or diminish the significance of the traditions held by groups like the Lemba. It's simply to say that the questions at hand are complex and require careful interpretation of a wide range of evidence. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, these questions are still the subject of ongoing research and debate.

What evidence is there that the ashkenazi are descended from the Israelites 

---

There are several lines of evidence that have been cited to support the idea that Ashkenazi Jews are descended from ancient Israelites:

1. **Religious and cultural traditions**: Ashkenazi Jews have maintained a distinct set of religious and cultural practices that are derived from Judaism as it was practiced in ancient Israel. This includes adherence to Jewish religious law, celebration of Jewish holidays, use of Hebrew in religious services and texts, and many other customs and practices.

2. **Historical records**: There are historical records from the Roman period onwards that refer to Jewish communities in Europe, including communities that are likely to have been ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews. These include references in Roman sources to Jewish communities in the Rhineland area of Germany as early as the 4th century CE, and references in Jewish sources to the migration of Jews from Italy to the Rhineland in the same period.

3. **Genetic studies**: Genetic research has found that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to each other than to non-Jewish European populations, suggesting a common ancestry. Genetic studies have also found links between Ashkenazi Jews and other Jewish populations, as well as non-Jewish populations in the Middle East, suggesting a common Middle Eastern ancestry. This includes the Cohen Modal Haplotype, a set of genetic markers on the Y chromosome that is found at higher frequency among Jewish men from the priestly Cohen lineage, including Ashkenazi Cohens.

4. **Linguistic evidence**: The Yiddish language, which was traditionally spoken by Ashkenazi Jews, includes elements derived from Hebrew and Aramaic (languages that were spoken in ancient Israel), as well as elements from German and other European languages. This suggests a history of cultural contact and exchange between Jewish and non-Jewish communities in Europe.

However, it's important to note that while this evidence is suggestive of a connection between Ashkenazi Jews and ancient Israelites, it does not definitively prove such a connection. As with all questions of ancestry, the exact origins of the Ashkenazi Jews are complex and not fully understood. 

Moreover, the concept of Jewishness encompasses not just ancestry, but also religious, cultural, and personal identity. Many people who identify as Jewish do so because of their religious beliefs, cultural practices, or personal or familial connections, not necessarily because of their genetic ancestry.

---

Each of these evidences exists for the groups formerly mentioned 

---

Yes, you're right. Many African groups who claim Jewish or Israelite descent, such as the Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews), the Igbo Jews of Nigeria, and the Lemba people of South Africa and Zimbabwe, have also cited religious and cultural traditions, oral histories, linguistic evidence, and more recently, genetic studies, as evidence supporting their claims. 

1. **Religious and cultural traditions**: These groups have unique religious practices and traditions that they believe link them to ancient Israelites. For example, the Beta Israel have a unique form of Judaism that they have practiced for centuries.

2. **Oral histories**: These groups have long-standing oral traditions claiming descent from ancient Israelites, including stories of migrations from the Middle East to Africa.

3. **Linguistic evidence**: Some of these groups, like the Lemba, have words in their languages that are similar to Hebrew, which they believe indicate a connection to ancient Israelites.

4. **Genetic studies**: Recent genetic studies have found that certain populations among these groups have genetic markers that are also found among some Jewish populations, suggesting a possible historical connection. For example, a significant proportion of Lemba men carry a Y-chromosome haplotype that is commonly associated with the Cohanim (Jewish priests), indicating a Middle Eastern ancestry.

However, as with Ashkenazi Jews, while this evidence is suggestive of a connection to ancient Israelites, it does not definitively prove such a connection. The exact origins of these groups and their historical connections to other populations are complex and not fully understood. It's also worth noting that Jewish identity encompasses not just ancestry, but also religious, cultural, and personal identity. Many people who identify as Jewish do so because of their religious beliefs, cultural practices, or personal or familial connections, not necessarily because of their genetic ancestry.

If these people have possess this evidence for centuries, and claim this identity, and even live this way, why won’t the Israeli government simply except them as Jews and allow them to return Israel seems to be following a pattern of discrimination against Black people just as America has historically done

---

The question of who is considered Jewish under Israeli law and for the purposes of the Right of Return is a complex one, influenced by religious, political, and social factors. The Israeli government's decisions on these issues have been the subject of ongoing debate and controversy. 

The Law of Return grants the right to live in Israel and to gain Israeli citizenship to all Jews, as well as to their children and grandchildren, and their spouses. However, the law does not clearly define who is considered a Jew, and interpretations of this have varied over time. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which is Orthodox, has generally defined Jewishness in religious terms, based on traditional Jewish law (Halakha). This defines a Jew as someone who is either born to a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism in accordance with Orthodox standards.

Therefore, groups that claim Jewish or Israelite descent, such as the Beta Israel, the Igbo Jews, or the Lemba, may not be recognized as Jewish under this interpretation if they do not meet these criteria. In some cases, members of these groups have been recognized as Jewish and allowed to immigrate to Israel after undergoing formal conversion processes. 

There have been allegations of discrimination in the application of the Law of Return and in the treatment of different Jewish communities in Israel. Critics argue that racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors have influenced decisions on who is recognized as Jewish and how different Jewish communities are treated.

It's important to note that these are complex and sensitive issues that touch on questions of identity, religion, race, and nationality. Different people and groups have different views on these matters, and the discussion is ongoing.

If Black people in America are descended from, for example, people, or Jews in Nigeria, who were captured and his slave in America, and then in America, they were forced to forget their language, so to delete the linguistic evidence of their identity. They were forced to except different names and different religious practices. They were taken away from their families and mixed around so that they could not maintain social or religious identities and pass down that information of tribal identity and affiliation. Given that many of the slaves in America came directly from these areas after conflict that drove the Jews out of Israel and into Africa , does it seem plausible that African-Americans do not know their identity and thus cannot claim their Jewish heritage

---

The Transatlantic Slave Trade was a horrific and devastating event that resulted in the forced displacement of millions of Africans, the destruction of their cultures and identities, and untold suffering and death. The cultural, linguistic, and religious practices of enslaved Africans were often systematically suppressed by slave owners, and their family and community ties were frequently broken. This has made it difficult for many African Americans to trace their ancestry and to recover their ancestral identities.

Some African Americans, as well as some black communities in Africa and other parts of the world, have claimed Jewish or Israelite descent based on various types of evidence, including oral traditions, cultural practices, and in some cases, genetic studies. These claims are part of a larger movement among some African and African diaspora communities to reclaim and reinterpret their histories and identities in the face of colonialism, slavery, and racism.

However, whether these claims are recognized by others, including by other Jewish communities and by the Israeli government, is a separate and complex issue, influenced by religious, political, and social factors. As we've discussed, the Israeli government's decisions on who is recognized as Jewish and allowed to immigrate under the Law of Return have been the subject of ongoing debate and controversy.

In the end, the question of who is considered Jewish is not just a matter of ancestry or evidence, but also of self-identification and recognition by others. Many people who identify as Jewish do so because of their religious beliefs, cultural practices, or personal or familial connections, not necessarily because of their genetic ancestry. And many Jewish communities, including both Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi communities, have a broad and inclusive understanding of Jewishness that encompasses a variety of ancestries, identities, and paths to Judaism.

Does the ADL say that blacks who claim to be descendants of the tribes are anti Semitic 

---

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a U.S.-based organization aimed at fighting anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, has raised concerns about certain groups within the Black Hebrew Israelite movement. However, it's important to note that the ADL's concerns are specific to groups that it has identified as promoting anti-Semitic and racist beliefs, and not to all individuals or groups who identify as Black Hebrew Israelites or who claim descent from the ancient Israelites.

In its reports, the ADL has noted that most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence. However, there is a rising extremist sector within the Hebrew Israelite movement whose adherents believe that Jews are devilish impostors and who openly condemn whites and other ethnicities.

These views do not represent the beliefs of all people who identify as Black Hebrew Israelites or claim Israelite heritage. This is a diverse movement, with a wide range of beliefs and practices. Many Black Hebrew Israelites have no affiliation with these extremist groups and do not share their views. 

It is important to avoid broad generalizations or assumptions about any group based on the actions or beliefs of a subset of that group. Just as there is significant diversity among Jewish communities worldwide, there is also significant diversity among those who identify as Black Hebrew Israelites or claim Israelite descent.

What would be a good way for African-Americans and Jews to work together to find out the identity of the African Americans who were enslaved and to see if they were the tribes so that they could be brought home

---

Collaboration between African-Americans and Jewish communities on exploring possible shared historical and cultural roots could involve several approaches:

1. **Historical Research**: Academic and independent researchers from both communities can work together to study historical documents, oral histories, cultural practices, and other sources of evidence that might shed light on the identities and histories of enslaved Africans.

2. **Genetic Research**: Advances in genetic technology have made it possible to trace individuals' ancestry in more detail than ever before. While genetic research has limitations and raises ethical and privacy concerns, it can potentially provide valuable insights when used responsibly and in conjunction with other types of evidence.

3. **Cultural Exchange**: Encouraging cultural exchanges and dialogue between communities can help foster mutual understanding and respect, and might also provide opportunities for people to discover and explore shared cultural elements.

4. **Policy Advocacy**: Members of both communities can work together to advocate for policies that support the exploration of African-American ancestry and the recognition of diverse Jewish identities, such as funding for relevant research and education programs, or changes to immigration laws.

5. **Education**: Raising public awareness about the diverse origins and histories of Jewish communities around the world, including those in Africa and the African diaspora, can help challenge stereotypes and promote a broader and more inclusive understanding of Jewish identity.

Such a collaborative effort would not only help illuminate the rich and complex histories of these communities, but could also contribute to broader dialogues about identity, belonging, and justice in contemporary society. However, it's also important to respect the autonomy and diversity of both communities, and to recognize that individuals have the right to self-identify and to define their own cultural and religious affiliations.

Can you make a note to add into the section about worshiping idols of wood and stone that and Deuteronomy 29 Moses begins to speak more about this, and it has to do with the people going in and having seen the idols of the people that they were going to mow and that he specifically says idles of wood and stone and then he says silver and gold which are both currencies so this relates to the idea that wooden stone would be Somehow related to the idea of money 

---

It seems you're suggesting an interpretation of Deuteronomy 29 that associates the "idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold" mentioned in the chapter with the concept of money or material wealth. This could indeed be a valid interpretation of the text, as the Bible often uses symbolic language and many passages have been interpreted in a variety of ways over the centuries. 

In this context, "wood and stone" could be interpreted symbolically to represent various forms of materialism or idolatry in a broad sense, not necessarily literal worship of physical idols. Similarly, "silver and gold" could be seen to represent wealth or greed. Under this interpretation, the passage could be understood as a warning against prioritizing material wealth or worldly possessions over spiritual values.

However, it's important to remember that interpretations of biblical texts can vary greatly, and different religious traditions, scholars, and individuals may have different views on the meaning of any given passage. Your interpretation is an interesting one and adds another layer of meaning to the text, but others may have different perspectives. This kind of dialogue and debate over the interpretation of religious texts is a fundamental aspect of many religious traditions, including Judaism and Christianity.
