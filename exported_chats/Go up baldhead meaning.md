# Go up baldhead meaning



---



---

So Elisha is cursed or is called baldhead in the Bible. What does that phrase go up? You baldhead. What does it mean? And specifically, what does it mean by go up?

The phrase you’re asking about comes from **2 Kings 2:23–24**, when some young men from Bethel mock Elisha by shouting:  

> “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”  

Here’s the breakdown of what’s going on:

---

## 1. **"Baldhead" (קֵרֵחַ – *qērēaḥ*)**
- In Hebrew, *qērēaḥ* literally means “bald” or “bald-headed.”
- Baldness could be literal (Elisha may have been bald or shaved his head), but it was also sometimes a term of **disrespect** or **insult**—similar to calling someone “old man” or “skinhead.”
- In the Old Testament, baldness could be associated with **mourning** (Isaiah 15:2) or **shame** (Isaiah 3:17, Micah 1:16).  
  Calling someone “baldhead” could imply **disgrace** or that they were under God’s judgment.

---

## 2. **"Go up" (עֲלֵה – *‘ălēh*)**
- Literally means **“ascend”** or **“go up.”**
- In the immediate context, this is likely a mocking reference to **Elijah’s recent departure into heaven** (2 Kings 2:11).  
  Elisha had just succeeded Elijah, who had been “taken up” in a whirlwind.
- The mockers may have been saying:
  - “Why don’t you go up like your master Elijah did?”—implying disbelief, sarcasm, or rejection of Elisha’s prophetic authority.
  - It could also mean “Get out of here!”—telling him to leave Bethel.

---

## 3. **The Deeper Insult**
- Bethel at the time was a center of **idolatry** (Jeroboam’s golden calf shrine – 1 Kings 12:28–33).
- The young men were likely **hostile to the prophetic message** Elisha represented.
- “Go up” = *leave us, vanish like Elijah*,  
  “baldhead” = *you have no honor, you’re cursed*.

---

**In short:**  
“Go up, you baldhead” meant **“Get out of here like Elijah—leave us—and you shameful man!”** It was both a rejection of Elisha’s prophetic authority and a mocking challenge tied to the recent miracle of Elijah’s ascension.

If you want, I can also show how this connects to other biblical “ascension” language, which would make “go up” more than just an insult—it would be a loaded prophetic taunt.
