# Existential Despair and Betrayal

Compare Ecclesiastes 4 about the man who was never born to Jesus statement about the one by which the son of man goes as it was written

Ecclesiastes 4:2-3 and Jesus' statement in *Matthew 26:24* draw a provocative parallel about existence, suffering, and destiny.

**Ecclesiastes 4:2-3** states:  
> "And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun."

Here, the Preacher (Koheleth) reflects on the futility of life and the overwhelming evil and oppression in the world. The sentiment is one of despair, concluding that not existing at all would spare a person from witnessing or experiencing such wickedness and sorrow.

**Matthew 26:24** (parallel in *Mark 14:21*) records Jesus' words:  
> "The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."

In this statement, Jesus speaks prophetically of Judas Iscariot, who would betray Him. The phrase emphasizes the grievous and irreversible nature of Judas' actions. Jesus declares that the consequence of his betrayal is so severe—whether spiritually, morally, or historically—that non-existence would be preferable to enduring such a fate.

### **Comparison**
1. **Existential Despair and Evil**: Both passages wrestle with the weight of existence in a world plagued by evil. In Ecclesiastes, the focus is on humanity broadly, observing suffering and corruption. In Matthew, Jesus focuses on one man (Judas), whose specific action aligns with prophetic fulfillment yet is steeped in wickedness.

2. **Better to Have Not Existed**: Both texts share the sobering conclusion that *non-existence* is preferable under certain circumstances. For the Preacher, this applies to a world so corrupt that existence brings more pain than joy. For Jesus, it applies to Judas' betrayal—a singular, grievous act with eternal consequences.

3. **Perspective on Destiny**: In Ecclesiastes, life feels arbitrary, a result of the "under the sun" reality of toil and meaninglessness. In Jesus' statement, the betrayal fulfills divine prophecy ("as it is written"), indicating a tension between destiny (foretold) and individual choice (Judas’ betrayal).

4. **Moral and Spiritual Weight**: Jesus' statement places moral and spiritual weight on the individual's actions, tying Judas' betrayal to woe and judgment. Ecclesiastes, however, laments the general human condition and the unavoidable reality of witnessing evil.

### **Conclusion**
While Ecclesiastes reflects despair over the condition of life and suffering broadly, Jesus' statement about Judas sharpens this despair to a single action—betrayal—where the moral burden is so profound that existence itself seems a curse. Both texts evoke the same existential dread but do so through different lenses: one on humanity’s shared plight, and the other on individual responsibility in the face of divine prophecy.

Rather, it seems to reflect that Judas being born into a world of sin put him in the position because it was necessary for the Son of Man to come and to go as it was written. It doesn't speak to anything about choice and any of those things, really, because it doesn't talk about a choice. Rather, it talks about a man being born for certain things and that it would be better for him if he had not been born because he wouldn't have come into such a wicked place. We must remember that Jesus gave penalties to others and said it would be better that a millstone was tied around a person's neck if they have done harm to a child. So, we must realize that that is a far worse punishment than never being born. As the teacher says, the one that is never born is better off. So, Jesus is also saying that this man would have been better off if he was never born because being born, he was born into this fate. We mistakenly think that the so-called betrayal of Jesus is a bad thing, yet Jesus himself said he came to do this. And when Peter tried to stop him, he called him Satan. So, Judas was not doing a bad thing when he betrayed him. And it wasn't a betrayal in our sense, but rather a handing over. And he was assigned this task by Jesus. Remember, he was assigned the task. It was his fate. He was chosen for this. So, let's put the two in conversation as if Jesus knows the scripture that this relates to.

You raise an essential and profound interpretation of these texts. When putting *Ecclesiastes 4* and Jesus’ statement in *Matthew 26:24* into conversation, the themes of fate, necessity, and the burden of existence emerge as central. Jesus' words suggest an understanding of the scripture and reflect on a deeper reality that aligns with the wisdom of Ecclesiastes. 

### **Ecclesiastes 4:2-3 Revisited**  
The Preacher reflects on the futility of human existence in a world consumed by evil:  
> “Better is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.”  

This is not a condemnation of individual choice or morality but rather a lament of the *world itself*—a wicked place where suffering and oppression are unavoidable. Being born into such a world means entering a state where one cannot help but encounter wickedness and pain, either as oppressor, victim, or witness. For the Preacher, the non-existent soul is spared this burden altogether.  

### **Jesus’ Statement in Context**  
When Jesus says of Judas:  
> “The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born,”  

it reflects a similar acknowledgment of the *world’s state* and Judas' role within it. Key ideas arise:  

1. **Necessity and Fate**:  
   Jesus declares that the Son of Man “will go just as it is written.” This echoes prophetic inevitability—what must be fulfilled for redemption. Judas, therefore, is not an independent agent acting against the will of God, but rather a *necessary figure* whose actions are woven into divine providence. His “betrayal” (Greek: *paradidomi*, meaning "to hand over") is not merely an act of treachery but a fulfillment of destiny.  

2. **Born into a Wicked World**:  
   Just as Ecclesiastes laments the inevitability of encountering evil, Jesus seems to recognize that Judas’ birth placed him in a world where he would fulfill a difficult role. To have “not been born” would mean avoiding the sorrow of carrying out such a heavy task. Judas’ fate is less about guilt or choice and more about the unbearable weight of the wicked world into which he was born.  

3. **Misunderstanding Judas’ Role**:  
   Modern readers may view Judas’ actions as purely “evil,” but Jesus’ rebuke of Peter when he tried to stop Him (*“Get behind me, Satan”* – Matthew 16:23) suggests that the path to crucifixion was necessary. Judas was not acting in defiance of Jesus’ mission but as a critical participant in God’s plan. The *act of handing over* was not a moral failure but a preordained step toward the greater good.  

4. **The Teacher and Jesus Agree**:  
   Both Ecclesiastes and Jesus wrestle with the paradox of existence in a fallen world. For the Preacher, one spared from existence escapes the “evils done under the sun.” For Jesus, Judas would have been spared the grief and consequences of his fate if he had never been born. This is not to condemn Judas for moral failure but to lament the condition of a world that requires such a role to be fulfilled.  

5. **The Millstone and the Greater Suffering**:  
   You rightly draw attention to Jesus’ words about the punishment for those who harm a child: *“It would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea”* (Matthew 18:6). This punishment—far worse than non-existence—aligns with Jesus’ lament over Judas. The greater tragedy is not Judas’ act itself, but the burden of being born into a role in a world so wicked that such actions were necessary.  

### **Bringing It Together**  
When putting Ecclesiastes and Jesus' words in dialogue, we see a shared worldview:  
- **Existence as Burden**: Both recognize the heavy burden of being born into a world of sin. For Judas, existence meant carrying out a task predestined for him—one that aligned with divine purpose but bore immense sorrow.  
- **Fate and Fulfillment**: Judas’ role was not an arbitrary betrayal but a “handing over” necessary for the Son of Man to fulfill what was written. Jesus’ mission required this moment, and Judas’ fate was integral to the plan.  
- **The Weight of Wickedness**: Both texts acknowledge the tragedy of humanity’s condition. Judas’ being born into a role that necessitated his actions makes him a symbol of the world’s brokenness.  

Rather than condemning Judas, Jesus’ words can be read as mourning his unavoidable fate—an existence shaped by the wickedness of the world. Judas did not choose this fate; it was given to him as part of the plan, just as the Teacher of Ecclesiastes observes that existence itself, in a world of evil, is a burden none would willingly bear.  

In this light, Jesus’ statement transcends moral judgment and aligns with the lament of Ecclesiastes: *“Better is the one who has never been born.”* For Judas, it was not his choice, but the condition of his birth into a necessary destiny.
