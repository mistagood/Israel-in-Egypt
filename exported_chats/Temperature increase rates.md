# Temperature increase rates

How much has the temperature increased over the last 40 years? And what was the rate of increase that we've experienced in heat in the last 40 years? Or maybe 50 years even.

Here’s what the science tells us about the warming we've experienced over the past 40 to 50 years:

###  **How Much Has Global Temperature Increased?**

- **Since 1975 (about the last 50 years):**
  - Global average temperatures have increased at a rate of roughly **0.15 °C to 0.20 °C per decade**. Over 50 years, this amounts to a total warming of approximately **0.75 °C to 1.0 °C**. citeturn0search4turn0search15
  - Confirmed by NASA GISS data: two‑thirds of the overall warming since 1880 occurred after 1975, at the same ~0.15–0.20 °C per decade pace. citeturn0search16

- **Since 1981:**
  - NOAA reports a rate of **0.18 °C (0.32 °F) per decade**, more than double the long-term rate since 1880. citeturn0search6

- **Recent acceleration:**
  - A 2024 study published in *Earth System Science Data* shows the warming rate accelerated to about **0.26 °C per decade**—a historic high. citeturn0news20
  - Another recent report puts the current warming rate at **0.27 °C per decade**, pointing to rapid acceleration. citeturn0news24turn0news21

###  **Summarized Figures**

| Time Period                 | Estimated Rate of Warming        | Total Increase (40–50 years)    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1975–2025 (~50 years)       | 0.15 °C–0.20 °C per decade        | ≈ 0.75 °C to 1.0 °C total         |
| 1981–Present                | ≈ 0.18 °C per decade              | ≈ 0.72 °C over 40 years          |
| 2014–2023 (recent decade)   | Accelerated to ~0.26–0.27 °C per decade | ≈ 0.26–0.27 °C total (over 10 yrs) |

###  **Narrative Answer**

Over the past 40 to 50 years, Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by approximately **0.7 °C to 1.0 °C**, which aligns with an average warming rate of **0.15–0.20 °C per decade**. However, this rate is not constant—recent decades show signs of acceleration. In the last decade, the warming pace increased further to about **0.26–0.27 °C per decade**, indicating a trend that, if continued, would lead to faster global warming in the coming years.

I'm American. I don't speak centigrade. I speak Fahrenheit.

Got it — let’s translate all of that into **Fahrenheit** for you.

### 🔥 **Global Temperature Increase in Fahrenheit (Last 40–50 Years)**

#### 📈 **How much has the temperature increased?**

- **Since 1975 (~50 years):**  
  - Global temperatures have risen by about **1.35°F to 1.8°F** total.

- **Since 1981 (~40 years):**  
  - NOAA estimates a warming of **0.32°F per decade**, totaling roughly **1.28°F** increase.

- **Recent decade (2014–2023):**  
  - The warming rate has **accelerated** to about **0.47°F per decade**.

### 🧮 **Rate of Temperature Increase per Decade (in °F)**

| Time Period           | °C per Decade | °F per Decade | Total Warming |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1975–2025 (~50 yrs)  | 0.15–0.20°C   | 0.27–0.36°F     | 1.35–1.8°F     |
| 1981–2021 (~40 yrs)  | 0.18°C        | 0.32°F          | ~1.28°F        |
| 2014–2023 (~10 yrs)  | 0.26–0.27°C   | 0.47–0.49°F     | ~0.47°F        |

> ✅ **Conversion tip:**  
> To convert °C to °F (for changes in temperature), multiply by **1.8**.  
> Example: 1°C = 1.8°F (for temperature differences).

### 🎯 In Plain Terms

If you're an American wondering how much hotter the planet has gotten:  
> The Earth has warmed about **1.5 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit** over the past 40 to 50 years — and the pace is quickening.

Let me know if you'd like that broken down for the U.S. specifically — since local temperatures are rising even faster in some areas.

---

So if the pace is quickening, it seems like there'll be a compound effect. The more heat there is, the more heat will be created, as well as increasing human activity. What could we see in an extreme case scenario happen in the next 50 years, if this is to continue or accelerate drastically? ...per decade.

---

You're exactly right: if warming continues or accelerates, the effects won’t be linear — they’ll be **compounding**. That’s because heat triggers feedback loops in Earth’s climate system, many of which **amplify** further warming. Below is a straight-to-the-point, U.S.-centric breakdown of what a **worst-case scenario** might look like **by 2075**, if current or accelerated warming trends continue **unabated**.

## 🔥 Worst-Case Climate Scenario: Next 50 Years (2025–2075)

### 🔁 **Acceleration & Feedback Loops**
> Warming causes more warming.

- **Melting Ice = Less Reflection**  
  → Ice melts → dark oceans/land absorb more heat → more warming  
- **Permafrost Thaw = Methane Release**  
  → Methane is >80x more potent than CO₂ short-term  
- **Drier Forests = Mega Fires**  
  → Wildfires release huge amounts of carbon  
- **Hotter Oceans = Fewer Clouds**  
  → Less sunlight gets reflected back to space

If we hit **0.5°F per decade** (as recent trends suggest we might), that’s another **2.5°F** global increase by 2075. Worst-case modeling under scenarios like **SSP5-8.5** (IPCC “business as usual” path) expects **3.6°F to 5.4°F** more warming by 2100 — much of it front-loaded.

## 🇺🇸 United States: What Could Happen?

### 🌡️ **Temperature Extremes**
-  **More days over 100°F** (especially in the South, Midwest, and Southwest)
-  **Severe droughts**: The Southwest could face near-permanent drought by 2075
-  **Northeast heat spikes**: Cities like Boston, NYC, and D.C. could see **60+ days per year** over 90°F

### 🔥 **Fire Zones Expand**
- The fire season in the West becomes **year-round**
- Regions like the Southeast and even Appalachia become **new fire zones**

### 💧 **Water Scarcity**
- **Colorado River and Lake Mead may collapse** as water sources
- **Groundwater depletion** accelerates in farm belts (especially California’s Central Valley and Ogallala Aquifer)

### 🌊 **Sea-Level Rise & Flooding**
- Sea levels rise **1 to 2 feet** (or more), threatening:
  - Miami, New Orleans, parts of NYC, Houston, Norfolk
- Coastal homes lose value → collapse of **insurance markets** and **local economies**

### 🦟 **Health Impacts**
- More heat-related deaths (especially among elderly, poor, and outdoor workers)
- Vector-borne disease spread (Zika, dengue, malaria) into U.S. South and Midwest
- Respiratory illnesses rise from ozone pollution and wildfire smoke

### 🏭 **Economic Consequences**
- **Crop yields collapse** (especially corn and wheat in the Midwest)
- **Energy grid strain** from high A/C demand and infrastructure breakdown
- **Insurance pullouts** in high-risk zones = housing market instability
