# Song reference explanation

According to a popular old tune, why should you be good to your five-feathered friend?

That’s from the 1950s novelty song “Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends,” a humorous tune popularized by Mitch Miller and others. The line goes:

> “Be kind to your web-footed friends,  
> For a duck may be somebody’s mother…”

So, according to the song, you should be good to your five-feathered (or web-footed) friend because **a duck may be somebody’s mother** — a silly, affectionate reminder to treat all creatures kindly.

Glad it landed. Tiny trivia: that camp song is a spoof set to Sousa’s “Stars and Stripes Forever,” and the classic line is “web-footed friends” — not “five-feathered” — unless you’ve met a very minimalist duck. 🦆
