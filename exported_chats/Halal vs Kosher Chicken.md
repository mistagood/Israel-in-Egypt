# Halal vs Kosher Chicken



---

When it comes to halal and kosher with chicken, what's the difference? Is it just the prayers or is there blood needs to be drained out because I don't see that it has blood in it.

Great question. There are similarities between **halal** (Islamic) and **kosher** (Jewish) slaughter practices, but there are some key differences—**not just in the prayers** but also in handling, inspection, and the treatment of blood. Let’s break it down, focusing on chicken:

---

### **Halal Chicken**
- **Blessing:** The slaughterer must be Muslim (or “People of the Book” in some views) and must say the name of God (“Bismillah, Allahu Akbar”) before each slaughter.
- **Method:** The chicken’s throat, windpipe, and blood vessels in the neck are cut with a sharp knife in a single motion.
- **Draining blood:** The blood is allowed to drain out. It is forbidden in Islam to consume blood (Qur’an 2:173, 5:3, 6:145).
- **Inspection:** No formal, religious inspection for disease is required, but the animal should be healthy at the time of slaughter.

---

### **Kosher Chicken**
- **Blessing:** The slaughterer (shochet) must be a trained, observant Jew, and recites a specific blessing at the start of a session.
- **Method:** Similar cut: trachea, esophagus, and major blood vessels in one motion with a sharp knife.
- **Draining blood:** The blood is drained, **but with additional steps**: kosher law requires *salting* the chicken (or soaking and salting) after slaughter to draw out remaining blood, even though most blood already drains out.
- **Inspection:** The bird’s internal organs (especially the lungs) are checked for defects—if any issues are found, it is not kosher.
- **Other rules:** Certain fats and the sciatic nerve are forbidden in some animals (not typically an issue in chicken).

---

### **So What About the Blood?**
- Even though you don’t see much blood in a supermarket chicken, both halal and kosher require the blood to be drained. Kosher takes it further: after slaughter, the chicken is **soaked in water, salted heavily, and then rinsed again** to extract as much blood as possible.

If you buy regular chicken in a grocery store, most of the blood is gone just from standard processing—but kosher chicken is **salty** for this reason (unless you buy unsalted kosher, which is rare and meant for special cooking).

---

### **Main Differences Summarized**
1. **Blessing/Prayer**: Both have blessings, but wording and who can recite it differs.
2. **Draining Blood**: Both require draining, but kosher adds *soaking and salting* to remove even more blood.
3. **Inspection**: Kosher requires religious inspection; halal does not have a ritual inspection after slaughter.
4. **Other Details**: Kosher rules are generally more detailed, with more post-slaughter requirements.

---

**In practice:**  
If you buy halal chicken, it should have no blood in it—same for kosher, but kosher will go an extra step to make sure. If you don’t see blood, it’s because modern slaughter drains most of it, and in kosher, the rest is removed by salting.

Let me know if you want more detail, or have a specific scenario in mind!

Okay, maybe you've misunderstood the question. I don't want a comparison. What I want to know is when it comes to birds, does the blood go through the muscles and all the meat like that, or can it be drained after? Like if I'm buying chicken or something like that, can I drain it, soak it, get the blood off? I'm not worried about the prayer parts. I'm worried about the blood and the ordinance that Moses said. Moses didn't command no prayers. He commanded not to eat the blood, so that's what I'm talking about. So if I'm getting chicken, how do I not eat the blood?

---

Thank you for clarifying. You’re absolutely right—**Moses’ command is about not eating the blood, not about prayers** (see Leviticus 17:10-14, Deuteronomy 12:23-25). Let’s focus strictly on the **practical and anatomical side** of not eating blood in chicken, as per the Torah.

---

### **Does Blood Stay in Chicken Meat?**

- **After slaughter**, most of the blood is in the major veins, arteries, and organs. The act of cutting the throat and draining removes the majority, but not all.
- **Some blood** remains in small capillaries within the muscles (meat), which is why meat can look red or pink, especially right after slaughter.
- **In birds**, there’s less blood trapped in the muscle compared to red meat (beef/lamb). When you buy chicken at the store, most of the visible blood is already gone.

---

### **Can You Remove Remaining Blood at Home?**

- **You cannot drain all the blood after the fact** by just soaking or rinsing a supermarket chicken, because once the animal is dead and the blood has stopped circulating, the blood left in the small vessels and tissues coagulates and binds to the meat.
- **Kosher practice** deals with this by soaking and salting immediately after slaughter, before the blood has a chance to fully coagulate and “set” in the muscle fibers. This process draws out the maximum amount of blood.

---

### **What About Soaking, Boiling, or Salting Chicken Later?**

- **Soaking in water** or brining can draw out a little more blood, especially if the chicken is freshly slaughtered, but with store-bought chicken, most of what comes out is just myoglobin and water—**not the forbidden blood as described in the Torah**.
- **Boiling** will also release some residual blood or juices, which is why you often see foam or scum at the top when making chicken soup. Skimming this off is traditional in Jewish cooking, but it’s not considered a full removal of blood per the Mosaic Law.
- **Salting** after the chicken has already been processed (like most supermarket chicken) is not effective—the blood has already coagulated and will not be fully drawn out.

---

### **What Did Moses Actually Require?**

- The Torah required the blood to be **poured out on the ground like water** (Deut. 12:16, 12:24).
- **In practice:** This means draining the blood while the animal is freshly killed and still warm. The blood must be allowed to flow out—this is why kosher (and halal) slaughter always requires a cut that severs the major blood vessels while the heart is still pumping or soon after death.

---

### **Bottom Line: Can You Avoid Eating Blood in Chicken?**

- **If you buy standard supermarket chicken**, most of the blood is already gone, but some remains in the tissue. There is no way to get all of it out after slaughter and processing.
- **If you want to strictly follow Moses’ ordinance**, kosher chicken is the only commercial option that uses the prescribed method of soaking and salting to remove as much blood as possible from the meat.
- **If you slaughter your own chicken**, immediately draining and (optionally) salting it yourself before rigor mortis sets in is closest to the Torah method.

---

### **Summary**
- Blood in chicken is mostly removed during proper slaughter and draining.
- Some remains in the tissue and cannot be fully extracted after the fact.
- Soaking, boiling, or rinsing after the fact helps only a little.
- **Only the traditional soaking and salting process, done immediately after slaughter, meets the strict Mosaic commandment.**

**If you want the most practical application today:**  
Buy kosher chicken, or if you slaughter your own, drain and salt it right away. There is no modern way to make regular grocery store chicken completely “blood-free” according to the Torah standard.
