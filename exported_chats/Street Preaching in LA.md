# Street Preaching in LA



---

In L.A. City County in California, where is it legal for me to set up to teach my doctrine with a small microphone and such? You know, when I see people out doing that and discussing the Hebrew Israelites and this and that, what are the parameters that you're allowed to do that under?

Here's a breakdown of the legal requirements and freedoms around street preaching or teaching doctrine in public spaces within Los Angeles City and County:

---

## 🗣️ 1. Public Speech & Free-Speech Zones  
- **Sidewalks, streets, plazas, and parks** are considered *traditional public forums*. Speaking, distributing literature, or using bullhorns is constitutionally protected speech citeturn0search13turn0search11.  
- You **do not generally need a permit** to speak on sidewalks or parks, as long as you don’t block traffic, obstruct pedestrians, or harass passersby citeturn0search13turn0search11.

## 📢 2. Sound Amplification Restrictions  
Under **LAMC Section 115.02**:  
- A permit is **required** to use sound amplification (like a microphone or bullhorn) in public (streets, sidewalks, parks) unless exempted citeturn0search1turn0search0.  
- **Volume limits**: Sound must *not be audible beyond 200 feet*, and must avoid being "loud and raucous," “unreasonably jarring,” or a nuisance citeturn0search1turn0search0.  
- **Time restrictions**:  
  - In residential zones (or within 500 ft): no amplification for non-commercial use between **4:30 p m and 9 a m** citeturn0search1.  
  - In non-residential zones (500 ft away): non-commercial amplification prohibited **10 p m–7 a m** citeturn0search1.  
- **Additional bans**: No amplified equipment:  
  - Within 200 ft of schools, hospitals, churches (outside the earlier allowed times) citeturn0search1.  
  - In specific high-traffic districts (Hollywood Blvd, Wilshire, Sunset, Vine, Central Traffic District) at all times citeturn0search1.

## 📋 3. Permits for Assemblies or Special Events  
- **Large gatherings**—such as organized assemblies or events that disrupt traffic—require a **Parade & Assembly Permit** via LAMC 103.111 citeturn0search7.  
- **Small, stationary gatherings** (e.g. one person preaching on a street corner) typically _do not require_ this permit so long as they don't block sidewalks or traffic citeturn0search13turn0search7.

## ✅ 4. Practical Steps to Stay Legal  
1. **Choose a public space** (sidewalk, park, plaza—not private or restricted areas).  
2. **Ensure pedestrian traffic flow remains unblocked**—don't set up tables or signs that inhibit movement citeturn0search13.  
3. **If using amplification**:  
   - Apply for an **amplification permit** through LADBS/LAPD under **LAMC 115.02**.  
   - Follow time limits and volume limits (not audible beyond 200 ft).  
   - Avoid residential zones after 4:30 p m, or non-residential zones after 10 p m.  
   - Do not set up near schools, churches, hospitals (200 ft buffer).  
   - Avoid restricted major boulevards.  
4. **Abide by noise nuisance laws**: LAPD can enforce under general noise ordinances citeturn0search5turn0search2.  
5. **Confirm assembly size**: If gathering becomes large or blocks streets, a **special event permit** may be required via Section 103.111 citeturn0search7.

## 📚 Legal Backing & Precedent  
- **Saia v. New York** (1948): A law requiring police permission to amplify speech was ruled a *prior restraint* and unconstitutional citeturn0search20.  
- Courts require any regulation of amplification to be narrowly tailored—not to silence speech, but to protect public peace citeturn0search22turn0search11.

### 🧭 Final Takeaway  
You're free to teach doctrine in public LA spaces using voice alone (without amplification), so long as you don't obstruct or harass.  
If you want to use a microphone or speaker system:
1. **Apply for an amplification permit** through LADBS/LAPD.  
2. **Follow municipal volume, buffer, time, and zone rules**—especially avoiding certain boulevards and residential restrictions.  
3. **Keep group size moderate**—assemble permit only needed if you're blocking traffic or streets.
