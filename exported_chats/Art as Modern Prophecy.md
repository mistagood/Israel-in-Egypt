# Art as Modern Prophecy



---

We have to understand that art is prophecy. In the Book of Kings, when he was about to prophesy, he said, Bring me a lyre. And they played the lyre, and he began to prophesy. David was a songwriter. Solomon wrote songs. All the songs are songs. And songs are prophecies. The art of prophesying is being able to hear the still, small voice. Because first comes the thundering and the earthquakes and all that. That's the music. The drums and other things that will come. And then the still, small voice. It's the inspiration that guides the speaker or the artist. And so, the modern rappers are the equivalent to the biblical prophets. Men languishing in oppression and hard times, coming out of slavery, and wandering in a land where they are expecting to be delivered. And so their songs, and even their lifestyle, reflects the conditions that they call out in their songs. These are really lamentations.

The connection between art and prophecy is a timeless one. The Bible itself provides numerous examples where art, specifically music and song, serves as a direct conduit for divine messages. In the Book of Kings, the prophet Elisha, before delivering a prophecy, calls for a musician to play the lyre, and in that moment of melodic inspiration, the prophetic word flows through him. David, a king and warrior, was also a psalmist whose songs became prophetic laments and praises, each one a reflection of his deep connection to the divine. His son Solomon, too, wrote songs filled with wisdom and insight, tapping into the sacred rhythm that binds all creation.

The power of music, especially in its rawest, most emotional form, has always been an avenue through which the divine speaks. As the scripture tells us, when Elijah stood on the mountain, it wasn’t in the mighty wind, the earthquake, or the fire that God spoke, but in the still, small voice that came afterward. That voice, that quiet whisper of inspiration, is what drives the heart of prophecy. It is the same voice that artists, poets, and musicians have sought throughout the ages.

Now, look at the modern-day rappers, particularly those whose voices emerge from the trenches of systemic oppression, poverty, and the scars of historical enslavement. They are not just entertainers—they are prophets. Like the prophets of old, they speak in the language of their people, channeling the pain, frustration, and hope of a people still wandering in a land that has yet to deliver them. Their lyrics are laments, much like those of Jeremiah or David. The struggles they describe, the violence they witness, and the hope they cling to, mirror the lamentations of biblical times, where a people cry out for justice, freedom, and divine intervention.

In this light, hip-hop becomes a modern book of lamentations, a prophetic voice crying out in the wilderness of urban despair. These songs are not just for entertainment, but are the raw, unfiltered expressions of a generation languishing in oppression. They are the modern psalms—songs of struggle, resistance, and hope, pointing toward a future where the shackles of systemic bondage will one day be broken.

The art of prophecy hasn’t vanished. It has simply evolved, now carried in the rhythm and rhyme of rappers and poets who, like the prophets before them, stand as the voice of their people. Their lifestyle, their hardships, their triumphs are all part of the prophetic story, calling out a society that remains deaf to their suffering. Like the psalmists of old, they continue to remind us: the cry for justice, for deliverance, is eternal.
