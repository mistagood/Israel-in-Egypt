Where is the supposed ascension in the Bible? Mark

The supposed “ascension” of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark appears only in the longer ending — the section from *Mark 16:9–20*. Specifically, the key verse is:

**Mark 16:19** —  
> “So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.”

However, this verse is **not found in the earliest Greek manuscripts** of Mark (such as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus). Most scholars agree that Mark originally ended at **16:8**, where the women flee from the tomb in fear and say nothing to anyone. The ascension passage — along with verses 9–20 — was **added later**, likely drawn from the traditions reflected in *Luke 24:50–53* and *Acts 1:9–11*.

So if we’re being precise:
- The earliest version of Mark has **no ascension** at all.
- The later appended ending introduces it with one short line, without the detailed narrative that Luke and Acts provide.

In short, the “ascension in Mark” exists only in the **later, extended ending** (Mark 16:19), and not in the original Gospel text.
