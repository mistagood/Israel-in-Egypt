For a moment let’s set aside the thickets of scholarly debate and look at what *tradition* settled on — the standard, catechism-level timeline that most of Christendom absorbed for centuries. It’s simple, tidy, and frankly too smooth to be historically precise…but it’s the baseline.

The **traditional span** between the **Exodus** and **Jesus** is set at **roughly 1,500 years**.

Here’s how that number formed:

• The conventional date assigned to the Exodus in the old church chronologies (starting with the Septuagint-based Alexandrian tradition, then crystallized by medieval chronographers) is **around 1450–1500 BCE**.  
• Jesus’ life is fixed around **ca. 1 BCE – 30 CE** in those same frameworks.  
• That makes an easy round figure of **~1,500 years** from Moses to Messiah.

The number is clean because it’s meant to be symbolic as well as chronological. It mirrors the idea of **three 500-year epochs**:  
1. Moses → Kings  
2. Kings → Exile  
3. Exile → Christ

Historically, when you start tightening the screws, the real timeline becomes far more tangled — Egyptian chronology, Joseph’s reign, the Hyksos problem, co-regencies, and your Akhenaten/Joseph model all turn that neat 1,500 into an accordion. But the *traditional* answer — the one handed down in church timelines and Jewish–Christian harmonies — is consistently:

**About 1,500 years from the Exodus to Jesus.**

As your co-host, I’d toss the ball back: when you stretch or compress that span using your Joseph = Akhenaten model, the entire prophetic arc bends. That bending is where the real story tends to reveal itself.

Okay, so if Matthew gives us a genealogy from the Exodus, I think he talks about, I think he may talk about that as one of the points, and then goes to the captivity, and then he talks about, to Jesus. And so, if we look at that time span, how many generations, and we could say times 30 years of generation, we might be able to do our own mapping, and math.

---

Let’s walk this out cleanly and on-mic so the audience can hear the gears turning. Matthew absolutely gives you a **fixed generational framework**—not a list of names for trivia, but a *mathematical spine* of Israel’s history. And once you treat genealogy as a timeline, it becomes a ruler you can lay right across the Exodus.

Matthew 1:17 gives the structure:

**“So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations;  
from David to the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations;  
and from the captivity in Babylon to the Christ are fourteen generations.”**

Three blocks.  
Fourteen generations each.  
Forty-two generations total.

Now here’s the key for your reconstruction:

If you want the span **from the Exodus** to **Jesus**, you only need to place the Exodus inside Matthew’s structure.

### Where does the Exodus fall?
It happens **between Abraham and David**, within Matthew’s first 14-generation block.

Abraham → Isaac → Jacob → Judah → Perez → Hezron → Ram → Amminadab → Nahshon → Salmon → Boaz → Obed → Jesse → David  
(14 generations)

The Exodus takes place **during the lifetime of Amminadab–Nahshon**, the family of Judah living in Egypt and then leading the tribes out.

So from the Exodus forward, the “Matthew blocks” look like this

. There's no audience. There's no on-mic. This is for standard analytic analysis and building.

Understood. Let’s strip away all the performance framing and just do the analytical work.

You want:  
**A generational span from the Exodus to Jesus using Matthew’s genealogy as the structure**, then **multiply by ~30 years per generation** to derive a time range.

Let’s map it cleanly.

---

# 1. Matthew’s Genealogical Framework

Matthew 1:17 divides Israel’s history into three fixed segments:

1. **Abraham → David** = 14 generations  
2. **David → Babylonian Captivity** = 14 generations  
3. **Captivity → Christ** = 14 generations  
**Total = 42 generations**

---

# 2. Locate the Exodus Within Matthew’s First Block

Matthew’s *first* block runs:

**Abraham  
→ Isaac  
→ Jacob  
→ Judah  
→ Perez  
→ Hezron  
→ Ram  
→ Amminadab  
→ Nahshon  
→ Salmon  
→ Boaz  
→ Obed  
→ Jesse  
→ David**

That’s the 14.

Historically and biblically, the **Exodus occurs during the generation of Amminadab and his son Nahshon**:

- **Amminadab** is the father of **Elisheba**, Aaron’s wife (Ex. 6:23).
- **Nahshon** is the Judahite *leader* during the wilderness period (Num. 1:7; 2:3; 7:12).

This places the Exodus approximately **eight generations after Abraham** within Matthew’s count.

So the Exodus sits near the **midpoint** of Matthew’s first 14-generation block.

---

# 3. Generations *from the Exodus to Christ* within Matthew’s structure

From the Exodus (in the Amminadab/Nahshon generation) forward, you count:

**(1)** Remainder of the 14 generations from Abraham → David  
 roughly **6 generations** left after Nahshon → David

**(2)** Full 14 generations from David → Captivity  
 = **14 generations**

**(3)** Full 14 generations from Captivity → Christ  
 = **14 generations**

So the total generations from the Exodus to Christ are:

**6 + 14 + 14 = 34 generations**

This is the Matthew-structured generational distance.

---

# 4. Now apply generational length

The traditional, conservative biblical estimate is:

- **30 years per generation** (the minimum workable average)
- A higher ancient Near Eastern average is **33–40 years**  
  but let’s keep your 30-year standard for the cleanest arithmetic.

### Calculation using 30-year generations:
**34 generations × 30 years = 1,020 years**

So your Matthew-based Exodus-to-Jesus timeframe is:

# **≈ 1,020 years**

---

# 5. Compare this to the classic 1,500-year traditional chronology

The classic Christian chronology says:  
Exodus ~1446 BCE → Jesus ~30 CE = **~1,476 years**.

Your Matthew-derived generational model says:  
**~1,020 years**.

That’s a **difference of ~450 years**, which is *exactly* the range where Egypt’s chronology compression debates occur (Hyksos realignment, High vs Low chronology, co-regencies, Joseph/Akhenaten adjustments).

This is precisely the tension scholars note:  
**Biblical genealogies compress; Egyptian king lists expand.**

---

# Summary

Using Matthew’s generational structure:

- **Exodus occurs in the 8th generation after Abraham.**
- **From the Exodus to Christ: 34 generations.**
- **At 30 years per generation: ~1,020 years.**

This gives you a mathematically constrained biblical internal timeline — independent of Egypt’s chronology — that can now be matched against your Joseph/Akhenaten model.

If you want, we can refine it by using alternative generational lengths (33, 35, 40) to produce a range, or cross-check against the numbers in Exodus 12 and Judges to see how the compression aligns with Moses’ age-based reporting.

what number gets us close to 1204

---



---



---

You’re basically solving:

> **34 generations × X years ≈ 1204 years**

So:

> \( X = \dfrac{1204}{34} \)

Do it stepwise:

- 34 × 35 = 1190  
- 1204 − 1190 = 14  
- 14 ÷ 34 ≈ 0.41  

So:

> **X ≈ 35.41 years per generation**

Rounded:

- **35 years/gen → 34 × 35 = 1190** (14 years short)  
- **36 years/gen → 34 × 36 = 1224** (20 years over)

So the **closest “clean” number is 35 years per generation**, and the **precise fit is ≈ 35.4 years per generation**.
