# Carotid and Vertebral Arteries

internal carotid, and vertebral arteries.

The **internal carotid arteries** and **vertebral arteries** are the **two major pairs of arteries** supplying blood to the **brain**. Here's a breakdown of each:

---

### **1. Internal Carotid Arteries**
- **Origin**: Branch off from the **common carotid arteries**, which themselves split from the **brachiocephalic trunk (right)** or the **aortic arch (left)**.
- **Pathway**: Ascend through the **neck**, enter the **skull** via the **carotid canal** (in the temporal bone), and supply the **anterior and middle portions of the brain**.
- **Branches**:
  - **Ophthalmic artery** – supplies the eye and orbit
  - **Anterior cerebral artery** – supplies the medial portions of the frontal lobes
  - **Middle cerebral artery** – supplies the lateral aspects of the cerebral hemispheres

### **2. Vertebral Arteries**
- **Origin**: Arise from the **subclavian arteries**.
- **Pathway**: Ascend through the **transverse foramina** of the cervical vertebrae, enter the skull via the **foramen magnum**, and unite to form the **basilar artery**.
- **Supply**: The **posterior** part of the brain including:
  - Brainstem
  - Cerebellum
  - Occipital lobes
- **Key Branches**:
  - **Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)**
  - Merge to form the **basilar artery**, which gives rise to:
    - **Posterior cerebral arteries**

---

### **Circle of Willis**
- Both systems (internal carotids and vertebrals) contribute to the **Circle of Willis**, an arterial ring at the base of the brain that provides **redundant circulation** (collateral blood flow) in case of blockage.
