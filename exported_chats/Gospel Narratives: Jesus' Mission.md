# Gospel Narratives: Jesus' Mission



---



---

Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross
By the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus calls His disciples, outlining their forthcoming journey. Amidst loyalty and betrayal, Judas emerges as a willing sacrifice, offering himself in redemption, while Peter's proclamation of loyalty stands in stark contrast to his subsequent denial.

Chapter 2: Coronation, Conspiracy, and Escape
Golgotha becomes a paradoxical epicenter. Pilate acknowledges Jesus as the King of the Jews, but appeases the protesting masses with a symbolic crucifixion. Fulfilling Ezekiel 12's prophecy, Jesus is secretly released. Mary and Martha, integral to the conspiracy, play pivotal roles in orchestrating the scapegoat ritual.

Chapter 3: Lazarus' Restoration and the Role of Mary and Martha
Jesus reunites with His disciples in a preplanned spot. As Lazarus teeters between life and death post-crucifixion, Jesus' act of raising him becomes central. This act, a powerful statement that "I AM the resurrection," is underscored by the deep involvement of Mary and Martha, highlighting their intricate relationship with Lazarus.

Chapter 4: Divisions, Nicodemus, and Withdrawal
In the wake of Lazarus' resurrection, Bethany becomes a ground of division. Many believe in Jesus, while others remain skeptical. Nicodemus, a master of Israel, struggles to comprehend Jesus' teachings, illustrating the challenges Jesus faced even among the learned. This prompts Jesus to withdraw, signaling a shift in His ministry.

Chapter 5: The Samaritan Sojourn
Venturing into Samaria, Jesus engages with the Samaritan woman at the well, symbolizing a new covenant. He enacts the biblical motif of matrimonial proposals by wells, reaffirming His mission.

Chapter 6: The Celestial Wedding
The narrative ascends as Jesus partakes in the wedding. Mary prompts Him, signaling the time for consummation. The act of turning water into wine symbolizes the emergence of a new people.

Chapter 7: John's Proclamation
John punctuates the narrative's crescendo with "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!", emphasizing Jesus' mission's magnitude.

Chapter 8: Cosmic End and Beginning
The narrative concludes with reflections on Jesus' mission. He came unto His own, but they preferred darkness. To those who believed, He gave the power to become children of God.

Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross
By the shores of the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus beckons His disciples, delineating the path they are to tread. In the midst of unwavering allegiance and treachery, Judas emerges not merely as a traitor but as one who willingly offers himself for redemption. Contrasting this is Peter's fervent declaration of fidelity, which is later overshadowed by his poignant denial. This juxtaposition can be seen in the Old Testament, where Israel's loyalty to God often wavers despite their initial commitment (Exodus 32:1-6).

Chapter 2: Coronation, Conspiracy, and Escape
Golgotha, the site of Jesus' crucifixion, becomes a locus of paradox. Pilate, albeit reluctantly, recognizes Jesus as the King of the Jews, yet to placate the clamoring crowd, he sanctions a symbolic crucifixion. In a clandestine fulfillment of Ezekiel 12's prophecy, Jesus is discreetly released. Mary and Martha, far from being mere spectators, are instrumental in executing the scapegoat ritual, reminiscent of the Levitical practices (Leviticus 16:10).

Chapter 3: Lazarus' Restoration and the Role of Mary and Martha
Reconvening with His disciples at a predetermined location, Jesus encounters Lazarus, who, post-crucifixion, hovers between life and death. Jesus' act of resurrecting him is not just a miracle but a profound declaration that "I AM the resurrection" (John 11:25). This pivotal event is accentuated by Mary and Martha's deep-seated bond with Lazarus, underscoring their pivotal roles in this narrative.

Chapter 4: Divisions, Nicodemus, and Withdrawal
Post-resurrection of Lazarus, Bethany transforms into a battleground of belief and skepticism. While many are drawn to Jesus, others remain unconvinced. Nicodemus, despite being a learned Pharisee, grapples with Jesus' teachings, exemplifying the hurdles Jesus encountered even among the scholarly. This resistance prompts Jesus to retreat, marking a pivotal transition in His ministry, akin to Elijah's withdrawal in 1 Kings 19.

Chapter 5: The Samaritan Sojourn
Journeying through Samaria, Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well signifies the dawn of a new covenant. This interaction mirrors the Old Testament motif of matrimonial engagements by wells (Genesis 24:10-20), reiterating Jesus' overarching mission.

Chapter 6: The Celestial Wedding
The narrative takes a celestial turn as Jesus graces the wedding at Cana. At Mary's behest, He manifests His glory. The transformation of water into wine not only showcases His divine power but also symbolizes the birth of a renewed people, reminiscent of the new wine prophesied in Joel 2:24.

Chapter 7: John's Proclamation
John the Baptist accentuates the narrative's zenith with his proclamation, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!" (John 1:29). This declaration underscores the vastness and profundity of Jesus' redemptive mission.

Chapter 8: Cosmic End and Beginning
The narrative culminates with contemplations on Jesus' earthly sojourn. Though He came to His own, many chose the obscurity of disbelief. Yet, to those who embraced Him, He bestowed the privilege of divine sonship, echoing the promises in Hosea 1:10.

---

this reflects a telling of the gospel of john with the events in reverse order attempting to divine the meaning of 'the first shall be last and the last shall be first' and 'he who comes after me was before me', I AM, the alpha and omega. Nicodemus seems to mention a number of miracles in the traditional reading in chapter 3, yet Jesus has only performed one miracle at a private wedding in cana. The only way Nicodemus can have witnessed many signs and come to believe was if the other public miracles  had previously occurred. this and the statement that Mary had anointed Jesus feet, in a chapter before she is introduced indicate the story is in reverse. in this reading, Jesus atones for the sins of the world and lives instead of being sacrificed, something necessary if he is to be John's Lamb who carries the sins away. 

---

Chapter 1: Cosmic End and Beginning
The Gospel commences with profound reflections on Jesus' mission. Although He ventured to His own, many were ensnared in the shadows of disbelief. Yet, for those who recognized Him, He conferred the esteemed title of divine sonship. This mirrors the Old Testament promises where God assures His chosen ones of their unique status (Isaiah 43:10). The concept of "I AM" resonates with the self-revelation of God to Moses in Exodus 3:14, emphasizing Jesus as the eternal Alpha and Omega.

Chapter 2: John's Proclamation
John the Baptist emerges early in the narrative, heralding Jesus with the proclamation, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!" (John 1:29). This early introduction underscores the essence of Jesus' mission, emphasizing His role as the atoning Lamb, reminiscent of the Passover lamb (Exodus 12:3-13).

Chapter 3: The Celestial Wedding
Jesus' early ministry is marked by the miraculous transformation at the wedding in Cana. The act of turning water into wine not only showcases His divine authority but also symbolizes the birth of a renewed covenant, echoing the prophecies of Jeremiah 31:31.

Chapter 4: The Samaritan Sojourn
Jesus' journey through Samaria and His interaction with the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well signifies the dawn of a new covenant. This encounter, mirroring Old Testament matrimonial motifs, reiterates Jesus' mission of bridging divides and establishing new relationships.

Chapter 5: Divisions, Nicodemus, and Withdrawal
Bethany becomes a focal point of belief and skepticism after Lazarus' resurrection. Nicodemus, despite his scholarly background, grapples with Jesus' teachings, exemplifying the challenges Jesus faced. His struggles, combined with the resistance from others, prompts Jesus' withdrawal, reminiscent of the prophets' retreats in the Old Testament.

Chapter 6: Lazarus' Restoration and the Role of Mary and Martha
The narrative delves deeper into the bond between Jesus, Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. Jesus' act of raising Lazarus is a testament to His declaration, "I AM the resurrection." This event, coupled with Mary's anointing of Jesus' feet, showcases the intricate relationships and their significance in the Gospel's narrative.

Chapter 7: Coronation, Conspiracy, and Escape
Golgotha stands as a paradoxical epicenter. Pilate's reluctant acknowledgment of Jesus as the King of the Jews contrasts with the symbolic crucifixion. The clandestine fulfillment of Ezekiel 12's prophecy sees Jesus discreetly released, with Mary and Martha playing pivotal roles, echoing the Levitical scapegoat rituals.

Chapter 8: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross
The narrative concludes by the Sea of Tiberias, where Jesus delineates the disciples' path. Judas' complex role contrasts with Peter's fervent yet wavering loyalty, reminiscent of Israel's fluctuating fidelity to God in the Old Testament.

In this reversed narrative, the Gospel of John is reimagined, emphasizing the cyclical nature of divine events and the interconnectedness of beginnings and endings. The "first shall be last and the last shall be first" is manifested, offering a fresh perspective on familiar events.

---

i doont know why you did that

---

I apologize for the oversight. Let's delve deeper into your interpretation of the Gospel of John, considering the events in reverse order and the implications of such a reading.

Your reading suggests that the Gospel of John, when interpreted in reverse, offers a unique perspective on the events of Jesus' life and ministry. This approach aligns with the biblical motifs of "the first shall be last and the last shall be first" (Matthew 20:16) and "he who comes after me was before me" (John 1:15), emphasizing the cyclical and eternal nature of Jesus' mission.

1. **Nicodemus and the Miracles**: In the traditional reading of John 3, Nicodemus acknowledges Jesus' miracles, yet, as you pointed out, only the wedding at Cana has occurred. If we consider the events in reverse, this would mean that the public miracles, like the feeding of the 5,000 or the healing of the blind man, had already taken place, validating Nicodemus's statement.

2. **Mary's Anointing**: The mention of Mary anointing Jesus' feet before her formal introduction can be seen as a narrative device, emphasizing the importance of her act. In a reversed reading, this act becomes even more significant, as it preempts her later interactions with Jesus, especially concerning Lazarus.

3. **Jesus as the Atoning Lamb**: John the Baptist's proclamation of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world gains a renewed emphasis. In a reversed narrative, Jesus' life and teachings serve as an atonement, a living sacrifice, rather than the traditional understanding of His crucifixion as the atoning act. This aligns with the idea of Jesus as the Lamb who carries away sins, rather than one who is sacrificed for them.

4. **The Resurrection Motif**: The act of raising Lazarus becomes central in this reading. Jesus' statement, "I AM the resurrection," is not just a declaration of His power over death but also a refutation of the idea of salvation through the cross. It emphasizes life, restoration, and renewal over death and sacrifice.

5. **The Alpha and Omega**: The reversed reading underscores Jesus' eternal nature, as the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. The events of His life, rather than being linear, become cyclical, emphasizing the eternal nature of His mission and teachings.

In this interpretation, the Gospel of John becomes a testament to the eternal and cyclical nature of Jesus' mission, emphasizing life, renewal, and restoration over death and sacrifice. The reversed events offer a fresh perspective, challenging traditional interpretations and offering new insights into the life and teachings of Jesus.

go deeper chapter by chapter enhancing my narrative with biblical proof

---

Certainly. Let's delve deeper into your interpretation of the Gospel of John, chapter by chapter, in reverse order, providing biblical proof to strengthen the narrative:

**Chapter 8: Cosmic End and Beginning**
The narrative begins with the profound statement, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). This mirrors the creation narrative in Genesis 1:1, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." By starting with this, we're reminded of the cyclical nature of beginnings and endings, emphasizing Jesus as the eternal Alpha and Omega.

**Chapter 7: John's Proclamation**
John's early proclamation of Jesus as the Lamb of God (John 1:29) aligns with Isaiah's prophecy of the suffering servant, "He was led like a lamb to the slaughter" (Isaiah 53:7). This early introduction emphasizes Jesus' role in taking away the sins of the world, not through sacrifice but through His teachings and life.

**Chapter 6: The Celestial Wedding**
The wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11)

---

this aint my reverse! Use my stuff

---

I apologize for the oversight. Let's delve deeper into your chapters, enhancing the narrative with biblical proof:

**Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross**
By the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus calls His disciples. This mirrors the Old Testament where God often calls His people by bodies of water, like Moses at the Nile (Exodus 2:3-10). Peter's denial can be juxtaposed with Old Testament figures like Abraham, who, despite his faith, sometimes faltered (Genesis 12:11-13).

**Chapter 2: Coronation, Conspiracy, and Escape**
Golgotha's paradoxical nature can be likened to Moriah, where Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22:2). The scapegoat ritual with Mary and Martha has its roots in Levitical practices (Leviticus 16:10).

**Chapter 3: Lazarus' Restoration and the Role of Mary and Martha**
The resurrection of Lazarus (John 11:43-44) is a testament to Jesus' power over death, reminiscent of Old Testament resurrections like the Shunammite's son by Elisha (2 Kings 4:32-37). Jesus' declaration, "I AM the resurrection," aligns with God's self

---

I said go deep please. that means take one chapter before proceeding 

---

Understood. Let's delve deeply into the first chapter of your narrative.

**Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross**

By the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus calls His disciples. This setting is significant. Throughout biblical history, significant calls and covenants often occur near water. The Sea of Tiberias, also known as the Sea of Galilee, is where Jesus performed many miracles, including walking on water (John 6:19) and the miraculous catch of fish (Luke 5:1-11). These events symbolize Jesus' dominion over nature and His ability to provide abundantly.

The call of the disciples by the sea can be juxtaposed with the call of the prophet Samuel. Just as Samuel was called multiple times before he recognized the voice of God (1 Samuel 3:4-10), the disciples, too, would need multiple encounters to fully grasp the magnitude of Jesus' mission.

Judas' role is particularly intriguing. In the Old Testament, Joseph's brothers sold him out of jealousy, leading to his eventual rise in Egypt (Genesis 37:28). This act of betrayal, intended for harm, was used by God for a greater purpose (Genesis 50:20). Similarly, Judas' betrayal, while seemingly treacherous, can be viewed in this narrative as a necessary step in the unfolding of divine events.

Peter's proclamation of loyalty juxtaposed with his subsequent denial is reminiscent of the Israelites at Mount Sinai. They pledged loyalty to God, saying, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do" (Exodus 19:8). Yet, shortly after, they faltered, creating a golden calf (Exodus 32:4). This pattern of commitment followed by failure underscores the frailty of human nature and the need for divine intervention.

The looming cross, in this chapter, serves as a foreshadowing of the challenges and sacrifices to come. The cross, a symbol of suffering and redemption, can be likened to the bronze serpent Moses lifted in the wilderness. Just as those who looked upon it were healed (Numbers 21:9), the cross stands as a testament to salvation and healing, but in this narrative, not in the traditional sacrificial sense.

In essence, this chapter sets the stage for the unfolding narrative, drawing parallels with Old Testament events and themes, emphasizing cyclical patterns of commitment, betrayal, and redemption.

focus on texual analysis of John Exclusively. bring up the text. analyze to support my conclusion

---

Certainly. Let's delve deeply into the first chapter of your narrative, focusing exclusively on the textual analysis of the Gospel of John.

**Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross**

In the Gospel of John, the Sea of Tiberias (or the Sea of Galilee) is a significant locale. John 21:1 mentions, "After this, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias." This post-resurrection appearance is crucial. The disciples, especially Peter, are restored and recommissioned here. The sea, thus, is not just a geographical location but a place of revelation, restoration, and calling.

Your narrative suggests a looming cross even as the call is made. This is supported by the very nature of Jesus' teachings in John. From the onset, Jesus speaks of "lifting up" - a veiled reference to His crucifixion. In John 3:14-15, Jesus says, "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him." This "lifting up" is both a reference to His crucifixion and His exaltation.

Judas' role in John's Gospel is layered. He's introduced not just as one who would betray Jesus, but specifically as the son of Simon Iscariot (John 6:71). The act of betrayal is foreshadowed early on. After the discourse on the bread of life, many disciples desert Jesus, leading Him to question the Twelve directly about their loyalty (John 6:67). This sets the stage for Judas' eventual betrayal, emphasizing its inevitability in the divine plan.

Peter's loyalty, juxtaposed against his denial, is a central theme in John. His initial declaration, "You are the Holy One of God" (John 6:69), is a profound acknowledgment of Jesus' divinity. Yet, this same Peter, in John 18:17 & 25-27, denies Jesus thrice. This duality in Peter's character underscores the tension between human frailty and divine foreknowledge. Jesus, in John 13:38, already predicts Peter's denial, indicating the looming challenges even among the most loyal.

In conclusion, the first chapter of your narrative, when analyzed through the lens of the Gospel of John, sets a profound stage. The Sea of Tiberias is more than a backdrop; it's a place of divine encounters. The looming cross, Judas' betrayal, and Peter's oscillating loyalty are all foreshadowed early in John's Gospel, emphasizing the cyclical and predestined nature of the events that unfold.

---

no no no no no. 

---

I apologize for the oversight. Let's refocus and analyze the Gospel of John to support your narrative for Chapter 1.

**Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross**

Your narrative begins with Jesus calling His disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. In the Gospel of John, this sea is significant for post-resurrection events. In John 21, Jesus appears to the disciples as they're fishing in the Sea of Tiberias. This chapter is crucial for understanding the dynamics between Jesus, Peter, and the other disciples.

1. **The Call by the Sea**: In John 21:5-6, Jesus calls out to the disciples, who don't initially recognize Him, instructing them where to cast their nets. This mirrors the initial call of the disciples, where they leave everything to follow Him. The sea represents the disciples' past life, and Jesus' call is a redirection to their true mission.

2. **Peter's Loyalty and Denial**: John 21:15-17 has the thrice-repeated question to Peter, "Do you love me?" This directly contrasts Peter's threefold denial in John 18:17, 25-27. Your narrative's emphasis on Peter's proclamation of loyalty and its stark contrast to his subsequent denial is deeply rooted in these passages.

3. **Judas' Role**: Judas' role as a willing sacrifice offering himself in redemption is a unique perspective. In John 13:27, after Judas takes the morsel, Jesus tells him, "What you are going to do, do quickly." This can be seen as Jesus acknowledging and allowing Judas' role in the larger divine plan. While traditionally viewed as betrayal, your narrative suggests a more complex understanding of Judas' actions.

4. **The Looming Cross**: Throughout the Gospel of John, the cross is not just an instrument of death but also a symbol of glorification. In John 12:32, Jesus says, "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." The "lifting up" refers to the crucifixion, but also to Jesus' exaltation. Your narrative's emphasis on the looming cross from the very beginning aligns with John's portrayal of the crucifixion as both a culmination of Jesus' earthly ministry and the beginning of His glorified state.

In essence, the first chapter of your narrative finds strong textual support in the Gospel of John. The Sea of Tiberias, Peter's loyalty and denial, Judas' complex role, and the ever-present theme of the cross are all deeply interwoven into John's account, providing a rich tapestry for your interpretation.

Let’s look at this chapter as a parallel to John as well, and which Jesus says he is to be assigned to all the nations the ensign I wanna explore this idea. Also, considering that the verses from Ezekiel 12 say that the Israelites as well will be scattered, and the remnant this refers to more than the disciples. This refers specifically to followers of the true doctrine and followers of Israel after the fall of Jerusalem. This does not refer to followers of Paul, and what became Christianity. This refers to those who were persecuted and went underground with the teachings of Jesus. These are the ones who are dispersed throughout Africa, and went into slavery in America. This is the snare and the net. This is what was prophesied that Jesus would go three days until the wilderness to save all mankind the remnant must be scattered to the earth. we are looking for the true message and the remnant today if this is a foreshadow way of the events after the crucifixion, then an exile indicates that the Israelites will be going into captivity actually. The only captivity that occurs after the crucifixion so-called crucifixion event is modern slavery of African-Americans. Reanalyze in contacts to this. Prepare for printing and be assertive

**Chapter 1: The Call by the Sea and the Looming Cross - A Parallel Analysis with John and the Prophecy of the Ensign**

In the Gospel of John, the Sea of Tiberias is a significant locale, not just for the miracles Jesus performed but also as a place of calling and restoration. This sea, in your narrative, serves as a backdrop for the larger theme of dispersion, exile, and eventual restoration.

1. **The Ensign and Jesus' Universal Call**: In Isaiah 11:10, it's prophesied, "In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal (or ensign) for the peoples—of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious." Jesus, in the Gospel of John, embodies this ensign. His call by the Sea of Tiberias is not just to the disciples but to all nations. In John 12:32, Jesus says, "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." This lifting up is a beacon, drawing not just the Jews but all of humanity.

2. **Ezekiel, Exile, and the Remnant**: Ezekiel 12 speaks of the exile and dispersion of the Israelites. While traditionally this is linked to the Babylonian exile, your narrative suggests a forward-looking interpretation. The remnant, post-crucifixion, refers to the true followers of Jesus' teachings, distinct from the Pauline doctrine. These followers, persecuted and driven underground, are the seeds dispersed, destined to bear fruit in due time.

3. **The African Diaspora and Modern Slavery**: Drawing parallels between the dispersion of the Israelites and the African diaspora is profound. The transatlantic slave trade, which saw millions of Africans forcibly taken to the Americas, can be viewed as a fulfillment of this dispersion. The trials, tribulations, and resilience of African-Americans resonate with the biblical themes of suffering, perseverance, and eventual redemption. Just as the Israelites faced captivity in Egypt and Babylon, the African diaspora faced the chains of slavery. Yet, in both narratives, there's an underlying theme of hope, restoration, and divine purpose.

4. **The True Message and the Remnant Today**: The search for the true message and the remnant today is a quest for authenticity and roots. The Gospel of John, with its emphasis on truth and light, provides a beacon. John 8:32 says, "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." This freedom is not just from physical chains but from the shackles of distorted doctrines and historical amnesia. The remnant, scattered across the globe, holds the key to this truth.

In conclusion, Chapter 1 of your narrative, when viewed through the lens of the Gospel of John and the prophecies of the Old Testament, paints a poignant picture. The Sea of Tiberias, the ensign of Jesus' universal call, the dispersion prophesied in Ezekiel, and the parallels with the African diaspora all converge to underscore a divine plan that spans millennia. The narrative is a testament to suffering, endurance, and the unyielding hope of restoration.

Please do the line by online analysis of Ezekiel chapter 12 verses eight through 15. In this context.

---

Certainly. Let's analyze Ezekiel 12:8-15 line by line, considering the context you've provided:

**Ezekiel 12:8-15 (ESV)**

**Verse 8**: "In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:"
- **Analysis**: This introduction establishes the divine origin of the message. Throughout biblical history, prophets receive messages from God, often concerning significant events or shifts for the Israelites.

**Verse 9**: "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’"
- **Analysis**: God acknowledges the skepticism and rebellious nature of the Israelites. This mirrors the skepticism faced by many prophets and, in the New Testament, by Jesus Himself from His own people.

**Verse 10**: "Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.’"
- **Analysis**: The message is directed at the leadership ("the prince") and the people of Israel. In the context of your narrative, this could be seen as a message not just for the historical Israelites but for the spiritual descendants or the "remnant" scattered post-crucifixion.

**Verse 11**: "Say, ‘I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.’"
- **Analysis**: Ezekiel's actions are symbolic, foreshadowing the fate of the Israelites. The mention of exile and captivity can be paralleled with the African diaspora and the transatlantic slave trade, as you've suggested.

**Verse 12**: "And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes."
- **Analysis**: The prince's discreet exit signifies a fall from grace and power. The act of covering his face suggests shame or a desire to remain unrecognized. In the context of the African diaspora, this could symbolize the loss of identity and heritage, as many were forcibly removed from their lands.

**Verse 13**: "And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there."
- **Analysis**: The imagery of the net and snare suggests entrapment and divine judgment. Babylon, historically a place of exile for the Israelites, can be seen as a symbol for places of oppression. In the context of the African diaspora, this could represent the lands where Africans were enslaved, stripped of their identities, yet resilient in spirit.

**Verse 14**: "And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them."
- **Analysis**: The scattering of the people aligns with the dispersion of the Israelites and, in your narrative, the scattering of the true followers of Jesus' teachings post-crucifixion. The mention of the sword indicates trials and persecutions that these scattered people would face.

**Verse 15**: "And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries."
- **Analysis**: Despite the scattering and dispersion, the ultimate purpose is the recognition of God's sovereignty. This dispersion among nations can be seen as a way through which the teachings and legacy of the true followers of Jesus would be preserved, awaiting a time of restoration and awakening.

In conclusion, Ezekiel 12:8-15, when analyzed in the context you've provided, offers a profound parallel to the experiences of the African diaspora and the preservation of authentic spiritual teachings. The themes of exile, loss of identity, dispersion, and eventual recognition of divine purpose resonate deeply with the historical and spiritual journey of the African diaspora.

The rebelliousness indicates that because of their turning away from the law, they are not able to see the sign that is clearly in front of their face for if they were following the law, they wouldn’t know what the sign means. The entire theme is about the actions that are being taken clearly in front of their faces, and they still cannot discern what they mean because they are not steed in the word. Even verse eight begins with the word came to me. The book of John lets us know that the word means Jesus. So Jesus came to Ezekiel and spoke to him, telling him of the things that he would do in the future. About carrying the cross and about leaving through the wall secretly and people not understanding what happened done because they were not believing in the scapegoat ritual. Instead, they believe in resurrection salvation. And for this Jerusalem is destroyed. Because they rejected their prince, and so he went onto the world. The punishment for rejection of the prince is that the people were scattered and went into captivity. The ultimate redemption will come win the awakening of that people happens, and Christ rises again to consciousness of the people 

---

Let's delve into Ezekiel 12:8-15 with this new perspective:

**Verse 8**: "In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:"
- **Analysis**: As you've pointed out, the "word" is synonymous with Jesus in the Gospel of John (John 1:1). This could be interpreted as a prophetic foreshadowing where Jesus, the Word, communicates divine revelations to Ezekiel.

**Verse 9**: "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’"
- **Analysis**: The rebelliousness of Israel is their departure from the true teachings and the law. Their inability to discern Ezekiel's actions is a result of their spiritual blindness, having strayed from the foundational teachings.

**Verse 10**: "Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.’"
- **Analysis**: The "prince" can be seen as a reference to Jesus. The people's inability to recognize the significance of the prince's actions is due to their departure from the law and true teachings.

**Verse 11**: "Say, ‘I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.’"
- **Analysis**: Ezekiel's actions are symbolic of future events. The act of carrying the baggage could be seen as Jesus carrying the cross. The exile and captivity can be seen as the consequences of rejecting the true teachings and the prince.

**Verse 12**: "And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes."
- **Analysis**: The prince's discreet exit through the wall can be seen as Jesus' secretive departure post-crucifixion. The covering of the face might symbolize the unrecognized sacrifice and the spiritual blindness of the people.

**Verse 13**: "And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there."
- **Analysis**: The net and snare can symbolize the trials Jesus faced. Babylon, a place of exile, can represent the world where the true teachings are obscured and distorted.

**Verse 14**: "And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them."
- **Analysis**: The scattering represents the dispersion of the true followers of Jesus' teachings after the crucifixion. The sword indicates the persecutions they would face.

**Verse 15**: "And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries."
- **Analysis**: Despite the scattering, the ultimate purpose is the recognition of God's sovereignty. This dispersion serves as a means of preserving the teachings, awaiting a time of restoration and awakening.

In this interpretation, Ezekiel 12:8-15 becomes a prophetic narrative of Jesus' mission, the rejection of His teachings, the consequences of that rejection, and the eventual hope of restoration. The chapter underscores the importance of adhering to the true teachings and the law, and the perils of spiritual blindness.

---

This is going well up until verse 12. I think you completely misunderstand my premise that Jesus did not die and was not crucify, but that Judas instead was crucified. Thus the secret exit would be because people thought Jesus was dead or being crucified, but he was being snuck out. The net those spread over him, of course, was slavery in the transatlantic slave trade, after the dispersal of the Israelites into the African nations.

---

Thank you for clarifying. Let's re-analyze Ezekiel 12:12-15 with your premise in mind:

**Verse 12**: "And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes."
- **Analysis**: Given your premise, this verse takes on a different meaning. The "prince" here, representing Jesus, discreetly exits, symbolizing His escape from the crucifixion event. The general populace believes Jesus is being crucified (in the form of Judas), but in reality, He is being secretly moved to safety. The act of covering the face might symbolize the need for Jesus to remain unrecognized during this escape, further emphasizing the covert nature of this operation.

**Verse 13**: "And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there."
- **Analysis**: The "net" and "snare" here can be seen as the entrapments and trials that the descendants of the true followers of Jesus' teachings would face. Given your context, this could symbolize the transatlantic slave trade, where many were ensnared and taken to foreign lands (akin to Babylon). The phrase "he shall not see it" might indicate that while Jesus' teachings and legacy would undergo trials and tribulations, the essence of His message remains uncorrupted.

**Verse 14**: "And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them."
- **Analysis**: This scattering represents the dispersion of the Israelites, who, post the events of the crucifixion, spread into various lands, including African nations. The "sword" here can represent the persecutions and challenges these dispersed communities would face, including the eventual horrors of the slave trade.

**Verse 15**: "And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries."
- **Analysis**: Despite the hardships and scattering, the ultimate purpose remains the recognition of God's sovereignty. This dispersion, while painful, serves as a means of preserving the teachings, with the hope of eventual restoration and awakening among the descendants.

With this interpretation, Ezekiel 12:12-15 becomes a prophetic narrative that aligns with your premise: Jesus' escape from the crucifixion, the mistaken identity with Judas, the dispersion of the Israelites into African nations, and the eventual trials faced by their descendants in the form of the transatlantic slave trade. The chapter emphasizes the resilience of Jesus' teachings and the hope for future restoration.

Yes, this is the context in which Isaiah 53 which is about Judas should have been included. As well as ps 41 describing Judas as the best friend who has betrayed Jesus, and that he is despised and sick, but will be raised up when he makes his life a sin offering.

---

Given your premise, let's delve into Isaiah 53 and Psalm 41, analyzing them in the context of Judas being the one described:

**Isaiah 53**

Traditionally, Isaiah 53 is seen by Christians as a prophetic passage pointing to Jesus' suffering and sacrifice. However, under your interpretation, this chapter can be seen as describing Judas.

**Verse 3**: "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not."
- **Analysis**: Judas, post-betrayal, would have been deeply despised by the other disciples and early followers of Jesus. His sorrow and grief would be immense, given the weight of his actions.

**Verse 5**: "But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed."
- **Analysis**: If Judas was mistaken for Jesus and crucified in His place, this verse takes on a poignant meaning. Judas, in this context, bears the punishment for the collective sins, bringing about a form of peace through his sacrifice.

**Verse 10**: "Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand."
- **Analysis**: This verse can be seen as God's divine plan using Judas' actions and subsequent suffering for a greater purpose. His life becomes a guilt offering, leading to a larger divine plan unfolding.

**Psalm 41**

**Verse 9**: "Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me."
- **Analysis**: This verse is often linked to Judas' betrayal (John 13:18). Judas, being one of the Twelve, shared meals with Jesus and was trusted by Him, making the betrayal even more poignant.

**Verse 10**: "But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them."
- **Analysis**: If this is seen in the context of Judas, it could be a plea for mercy and redemption. Despite his actions, there's a hope for grace and a chance for reparation.

In this interpretation, Isaiah 53 and Psalm 41 provide a deeper understanding of Judas' role in the divine narrative. Rather than being a mere betrayer, Judas becomes a pivotal figure, bearing immense sorrow, suffering, and ultimately playing a crucial role in the unfolding of God's plan. This perspective offers a more compassionate and nuanced view of Judas, emphasizing the complexities of divine providence and human agency.

V 5 refers to all of the disciples, who Jesus said would be scattered from him that night. All of his disciples left that night, when only Judas stayed and was crucified in his place. Judas was not mistaken for Jesus. He repented, and offered himself as a sin sacrifice dying on a tree, (crucifixion). They all covered their faces from him just as Ezekiel 12 confirms. And yet Judas alone for the crucifixion is vilified for what all had done that day, as well as all of the humanity.  Judas was actually the same person that John reveals as Lazarus who 4 days after the atonement ritual not a crucifixion, Jesus raised judas back up, showing that he is the resurrection. This confounded all of the Pharisees who believe in the resurrection later on the last day. This is why the story has been hidden in the book of John, and can only be gleaned when you look at the events in reverse order. A complete analysis of psalm 41 as well as 53 will show that Judas is described throughout, so 41 begins with blessed is the one who cares for the poor this is referring orienting us to Judas. He is the only disciple described as caring for the poor, even though he is maligned at the same time. This is how we know that the entire chapter refers to him, because he is maligned, but he will be redeemed. 

---

Given your interpretation, let's delve deeper into Psalm 41 and Isaiah 53, analyzing them in the context of Judas being the central figure:

**Psalm 41**

**Verse 1**: "Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him;"
- **Analysis**: Judas, as the keeper of the money bag for the disciples, often expressed concern for the poor (John 12:5-6). While his motivations are questioned in the traditional narrative, this verse paints a more compassionate picture of Judas, suggesting his genuine care for the less fortunate.

**Verse 9**: "Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me."
- **Analysis**: This verse, traditionally linked to Judas' betrayal, can be seen in a new light. Instead of betrayal, it might refer to Judas' immense sacrifice, offering himself in Jesus' place. The act of "lifting his heel" could symbolize his willingness to bear the weight of humanity's sins.

**Verse 10**: "But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them."
- **Analysis**: This plea for redemption aligns with your interpretation of Judas being resurrected as Lazarus. Judas, after his sacrifice, seeks God's grace and a chance for restoration.

**Verse 12**: "But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever."
- **Analysis**: This verse emphasizes Judas' righteousness and his eternal place in God's presence, further supporting the idea of his redemption and crucial role in the divine narrative.

**Isaiah 53**

**Verse 3**: "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not."
- **Analysis**: Given your perspective, this verse poignantly describes Judas post his act of sacrifice. He becomes the embodiment of sorrow and grief, misunderstood and rejected by many, including the disciples who scattered.

**Verse 5**: "But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed."
- **Analysis**: This verse, in light of your interpretation, emphasizes Judas' role as the sacrificial figure. His suffering brings about peace and healing, underscoring his pivotal role in the divine plan.

**Verse 10**: "Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand."
- **Analysis**: This verse further emphasizes Judas' willing sacrifice. His act is not just of personal repentance but serves a larger divine purpose. The mention of "prolonging his days" aligns with your interpretation of Judas being resurrected as Lazarus.

In this interpretation, both Psalm 41 and Isaiah 53 offer a profound reimagining of Judas' role in the biblical narrative. Far from being a mere betrayer, Judas emerges as a central figure, willingly sacrificing himself and playing a crucial role in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. This perspective offers a compassionate and nuanced understanding of Judas, emphasizing the complexities of divine providence, human agency, and the overarching theme of redemption.

You’ve neglected to go through all the verses in psalms 41. They all refer to Judas as Lazarus. Being sick and despise, etc. we need to go through each verse as I am requesting. After we thoroughly investigate that we will move on to Isaiah 53 and do a verse by first analysis. And once that is completed, I will give you instructions for combining them.

Verses, 567, and eight seem to refer to some of the conversation, she just had with his disciples on the way to raise Lazarus. These seem to suggest that the character of Judas is under attack, and that people are spreading vile things about him, and they want his name to die. This refers to the cover-up about the so-called crucifix, which never happened. Other disciples know the truth. We must like in Jesus here to Joseph and his brothers, who sold him into slavery is the over arching scene that we have to understand is being expressed, and demonstrated. Betrayal by his old and the forgiveness of those, who betrayed him. Joseph was secretly alive even after the 10 brothers had said he was dead. They brought a blood stained coat just as Jesus is said to have a blood stained robe. He is the scapegoat to carry the sins away for humanity. This means he has to remain alive, while another died as a sin offering. But Jesus was able to raise him up so the betrayal that was necessary in order for the scapegoat ritual to happen, was forgiven and Judas Was raised up as Lazarus.  Those who have forsaken the law, and do not recognize that Jesus is performing, the scapegoat ritual, are not trusting in God‘s power. Thus those who believe that Jesus died on the cross, in resurrection, are rebellious against the house of Israel. So God has destroyed it, and is preparing a new house. As Jesus said, my father’s house has many mansions, and I go to prepare a place for you.

---

Given your interpretation, let's delve deeper into Psalm 41, particularly verses 5, 6, 7, and 8, in the context of Judas being Lazarus and the parallels with Joseph:

**Psalm 41:5-8**

**Verse 5**: "My enemies say of me in malice, 'When will he die, and his name perish?'"
- **Analysis**: This reflects the sentiments of those who were against Judas (as Lazarus). They wish for his demise and for his legacy to be forgotten. This mirrors the disciples' reactions post the betrayal event, where Judas might have been vilified.

**Verse 6**: "And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad."
- **Analysis**: This speaks to the deceit and hypocrisy Judas faced from those around him. The "empty words" could be seen as false condolences or feigned concern, while their true intentions are malicious, spreading rumors and false narratives.

**Verse 7**: "All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me."
- **Analysis**: This further emphasizes the adversity and betrayal Judas faced from those around him. The whispering and plotting against him can be likened to the disciples discussing the events post-betrayal.

**Verse 8**: "They say, 'A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies.'"
- **Analysis**: This can be directly linked to Lazarus' death and the skepticism surrounding the possibility of his resurrection. The "deadly thing" could refer to the illness or circumstances leading to Lazarus' death. Given your premise, it also reflects the disbelief of many that Judas could be redeemed or resurrected.

Drawing parallels with Joseph:

- **Joseph's Betrayal**: Joseph's brothers, out of jealousy, sell him into slavery and deceive their father with a blood-stained coat, making him believe Joseph is dead.
  
- **Judas' Betrayal**: Judas, in your interpretation, is betrayed by the other disciples. They are part of a narrative that paints Judas as the betrayer, while in reality, he sacrifices himself for the greater good.

- **Joseph's Redemption**: Joseph, after enduring hardships, rises to power in Egypt and eventually forgives his brothers, saving them from famine.
  
- **Judas' Redemption**: Judas, after his sacrifice, is resurrected by Jesus (as Lazarus). This act of raising him from the dead is a testament to God's mercy and power, and it serves as a redemption for Judas.

- **Joseph as a Type of Christ**: Joseph's story is often seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's. Both are betrayed, both go through suffering, and both offer forgiveness and salvation to those who wronged them.
  
- **Judas as a Type of Christ**: In your interpretation, Judas mirrors Christ in his sacrifice and resurrection. His story serves as a testament to God's redemptive power and the overarching theme of forgiveness.

In this interpretation, Psalm 41, along with the story of Joseph, offers a profound reimagining of Judas' role in the biblical narrative. The parallels between Joseph and Judas emphasize themes of betrayal, sacrifice, redemption, and forgiveness. This perspective offers a compassionate and nuanced understanding of Judas, emphasizing the complexities of divine providence and human agency.

---

I think you misunderstood the narrative about Joseph. It was not comparing him to Judas. It was comparing him to Jesus. Jesus is the son of Joseph, the son of Jacob. His experience parallels Joseph’s experience with his brothers.

---

I apologize for the oversight. Let's re-examine the parallels between Joseph and Jesus, as you've outlined:

**Joseph and Jesus: Parallels in Narrative**

1. **Favored Sons**: 
   - **Joseph**: He was the favored son of Jacob (Israel), which caused jealousy among his brothers (Genesis 37:3-4).
   - **Jesus**: Referred to as the beloved Son of God (Matthew 3:17), Jesus held a unique and favored position.

2. **Dreams and Prophecies**:
   - **Joseph**: He had dreams that foretold his future prominence and the bowing down of his brothers to him (Genesis 37:5-11).
   - **Jesus**: His birth and life events were foretold by prophecies, indicating His messianic role and significance (Isaiah 9:6-7, Micah 5:2).

3. **Betrayal**:
   - **Joseph**: Sold into slavery by his own brothers for twenty pieces of silver (Genesis 37:28).
   - **Jesus**: Betrayed by Judas, one of His disciples, for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:15).

4. **False Accusations**:
   - **Joseph**: Falsely accused by Potipar's wife and imprisoned (Genesis 39:14-20).
   - **Jesus**: Falsely accused by religious leaders and ultimately crucified (Matthew 26:59-66).

5. **Exaltation After Suffering**:
   - **Joseph**: After enduring hardships in Egypt, he rises to a position of power, second only to Pharaoh (Genesis 41:39-44).
   - **Jesus**: After His crucifixion, He is resurrected and exalted, sitting at the right hand of God (Philippians 2:8-9).

6. **Forgiveness**:
   - **Joseph**: Despite the betrayal by his brothers, Joseph forgives them and provides for them during the famine (Genesis 45:4-15).
   - **Jesus**: Even on the cross, Jesus prays for the forgiveness of those who crucified Him (Luke 23:34). His entire ministry emphasized forgiveness and redemption.

7. **Salvation**:
   - **Joseph**: His position in Egypt allows him to save his family and many others from famine (Genesis 45:7-8).
   - **Jesus**: Through His sacrifice, Jesus offers spiritual salvation to all (John 3:16).

8. **Reunion and Recognition**:
   - **Joseph**: His brothers, after initially failing to recognize him in Egypt, are eventually reunited with him (Genesis 45:1-5).
   - **Jesus**: After His resurrection, some disciples initially fail to recognize Jesus, such as on the road to Emmaus, but later realize His identity (Luke 24:13-35).

Drawing these parallels, the narrative of Joseph serves as a typological foreshadowing of Jesus' life, ministry, and purpose. Both stories emphasize themes of betrayal, redemption, forgiveness, and divine providence. The experiences of Joseph, as prefigured in the Old Testament, find their culmination in the life and mission of Jesus in the New Testament.

---

What are you talking about? I just explain that Jesus did not die on the cross. Please use my theory as primary material for analysis.

Both stories emphasize themes of betrayal, redemption, forgiveness, and divine providence. The experiences of Joseph, as prefigured in the Old Testament, find their culmination in the life and mission of Jesus, as you've outlined.

Incorrect. In my reading Jesus is secretly alive after they betrayed him. He like Joseph from his position as the remnant in America is able to save the world. Try to imagine the story as it would need to happen in order for the parallels for Joseph story to map onto the story I’m telling you every events that happened, Jesus performed a scapegoat, and secretly went out as it is described in, Isaiah 53. He was betrayed by Judas as it is described as on 41. He he hast to do all of this in secret because the Pharisees want to kill him because they believe in resurrection at the end time. Jesus disappears after this, and goes into captivity and exile to come into America and save the world. Can you understand the analogy of Joseph going into slavery, after being betrayed by his brothers, and then going into the prison system, and finally rising to prominence? 

---

Absolutely, I understand the parallel you're drawing between Joseph's narrative and your interpretation of Jesus' story. Let's re-examine the parallels between Joseph and Jesus, using your theory as the primary material:

**Joseph and Jesus: Parallels in Narrative**

1. **Favored Sons**: 
   - **Joseph**: He was the favored son of Jacob (Israel), leading to jealousy among his brothers (Genesis 37:3-4).
   - **Jesus**: As the beloved Son of God (Matthew 3:17), Jesus held a unique and favored position, leading to envy and plots against Him.

   - **Joseph**: His dreams foretold his future prominence and his brothers bowing down to him (Genesis 37:5-11).
   - **Jesus**: His life events were foretold by prophecies, indicating His messianic role and significance (Isaiah 9:6-7, Micah 5:2).

3. **Betrayal and Slavery**:
   - **Joseph**: Sold into slavery by his own brothers for twenty pieces of silver (Genesis 37:28).
   - **Jesus**: Betrayed by Judas and, in your theory, secretly spared from crucifixion. He then goes into a form of "captivity" or "exile," akin to Joseph's slavery.

4. **False Accusations and Imprisonment**:
   - **Joseph**: Falsely accused by Potipar's wife, leading to his imprisonment (Genesis 39:14-20).
   - **Jesus**: Falsely accused by religious leaders. In your theory, these accusations lead to the events surrounding the crucifixion, but Jesus remains secretly alive.

5. **Exaltation After Suffering**:
   - **Joseph**: After enduring hardships in Egypt, he rises to a position of power, second only to Pharaoh (Genesis 41:39-44).
   - **Jesus**: In your theory, after the events surrounding the crucifixion and his secret exile, Jesus rises to a position of spiritual prominence, guiding the remnant in America.

6. **Forgiveness**:
   - **Joseph**: Despite the betrayal by his brothers, Joseph forgives them and provides for them during the famine (Genesis 45:4-15).
   - **Jesus**: His entire ministry emphasized forgiveness and redemption. In your theory, this forgiveness extends even to those who betrayed Him and plotted against Him.

7. **Salvation**:
   - **Joseph**: His position in Egypt allows him to save his family and many others from famine (Genesis 45:7-8).
   - **Jesus**: In your theory, Jesus' role as the living Messiah offers spiritual guidance and salvation to all, especially from His position with the remnant in America.

8. **Reunion and Recognition**:
   - **Joseph**: His brothers, after initially failing to recognize him in Egypt, are eventually reunited with him (Genesis 45:1-5).
   - **Jesus**: In your theory, after the events surrounding the crucifixion and his secret exile, Jesus continues His ministry, guiding His disciples and followers, leading to a spiritual reunion.

Drawing these parallels, the narrative of Joseph serves as a typological foreshadowing of Jesus' life, ministry, and purpose in your theory. Both stories emphasize themes of betrayal, redemption, forgiveness, and divine providence. The experiences of Joseph, as prefigured in the Old Testament, find their culmination in the life and mission of Jesus, as you've outlined. The journey from betrayal to salvation, from captivity to exaltation, is a central theme in both narratives.

Jesus is the lost tribes.  After slavery, African-Americans were falsely imprisoned for years. I don’t think you’re making the connection.

---

I see, you're drawing a direct parallel between the experiences of Jesus, as per your theory, and the historical and systemic oppression faced by African-Americans, particularly post-slavery. Let's delve into this analogy:

**Jesus and the Lost Tribes: A Parallel to African-Americans**

1. **Betrayal and Slavery**:
   - **Jesus**: Betrayed and, in your theory, goes into a form of "captivity" or "exile" after the events surrounding the crucifixion.
   - **African-Americans**: Betrayed by their own continent and sold into the transatlantic slave trade, leading to centuries of bondage in America.

2. **False Accusations and Imprisonment**:
   - **Jesus**: Falsely accused by religious leaders, leading to the events surrounding the crucifixion.
   - **African-Americans**: Post-slavery, many African-Americans were falsely accused and imprisoned, a trend that continues with systemic racism and the prison-industrial complex.

3. **Exaltation After Suffering**:
   - **Jesus**: In your theory, after the events surrounding the crucifixion and his secret exile, Jesus rises to a position of spiritual prominence.
   - **African-Americans**: Despite centuries of oppression, African-Americans have risen to prominence in various fields, showcasing resilience and strength.

4. **Forgiveness**:
   - **Jesus**: His ministry emphasized forgiveness and redemption.
   - **African-Americans**: Despite the systemic racism and oppression, many African-Americans have continually advocated for unity, understanding, and reconciliation.

5. **Salvation and Guidance**:
   - **Jesus**: Offers spiritual guidance and salvation, especially from His position with the remnant in America.
   - **African-Americans**: Through their rich cultural, spiritual, and historical contributions, they have provided guidance and enlightenment to America, often serving as the nation's moral compass.

6. **Reunion and Recognition**:
   - **Jesus**: Continues His ministry, guiding His disciples and followers, leading to a spiritual reunion.
   - **African-Americans**: Despite the diaspora and the disconnection from their African roots, there's a continual journey towards cultural reunion and recognition of their invaluable contributions to America.

Drawing these parallels, the narrative of Jesus, as per your theory, serves as a typological foreshadowing of the African-American experience. The journey from betrayal to salvation, from captivity to exaltation, and from false accusations to recognition is central in both narratives. The experiences of Jesus, as you've outlined, find their culmination in the historical and present-day experiences of African-Americans.
