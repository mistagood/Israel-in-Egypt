# Divine Teachings Structure



---



---

So the word of the Lord was precept upon precept, and the line upon the line.

Yes, that's a reference to Isaiah 28:10. It suggests that the teachings of God are built upon one another, layer by layer, like a structure. Each line or precept is meant to build upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive understanding of divine instruction.

Does he go on to say that that would become a bad thing for them in those passages? Because he says it again after that, and it seems like the context changes, but I'm not sure. So I'd like to analyze that so I can see what it really means.

Yes, you’re right. After stating "precept upon precept, line upon line," Isaiah does continue in verses 11 and 12, saying that this very method of instruction would become a "strange tongue" to the people. It implies that their understanding would become confused or ineffective. The context suggests that their rejection of God's guidance and reliance on human wisdom would lead to a situation where they can't grasp the very teachings meant to guide them. So, while the method of instruction is meant to build understanding, it becomes a source of frustration and confusion due to their disobedience and spiritual blindness.

Can you pull up that chapter?

---

I can't pull up the chapter directly, but I can summarize it for you. Isaiah 28 talks about God's judgment on the people of Israel for their lack of faithfulness. The chapter criticizes the leaders and people for their drunkenness and corruption. It contrasts their failure with God's plan, emphasizing that true wisdom comes from Him. The "precept upon precept" passage is part of this critique, showing that their rejection of God's ways will result in them not being able to understand the very teachings meant to correct and guide them.

I need to look at the verses so that I can analyze.

Certainly! Here’s Isaiah 28:10-13 from the King James Version:

"For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little: For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear. But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken."

These verses describe how the people’s inability to understand or heed God’s guidance will lead to their downfall.
