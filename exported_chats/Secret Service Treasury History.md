Short version: the Secret Service started as the Treasury Department’s in-house anti-counterfeiting squad—and stayed there for almost 140 years.

- In 1865, Treasury created the Secret Service to crush rampant counterfeiting that was destabilizing the post-Civil War economy (contemporary estimates put fake money at roughly one-third of U.S. currency in circulation). citeturn0search0turn5view0  
- Through the late 1800s it remained a Treasury bureau and broadened to other fiscal crimes. After President McKinley’s assassination (1901), the Service took on full-time presidential protection (1902), and Congress first funded that duty in 1906—still while housed in Treasury. citeturn3view0  
- In 2003, the Homeland Security Act transferred the Secret Service from Treasury to the new Department of Homeland Security, ending its formal placement under Treasury but not its financial-crime portfolio. citeturn4view0  
- Because its original—and continuing—mission includes protecting the nation’s money (counterfeit U.S. currency and related financial crimes), you’ll still see close operational ties with Treasury functions even though the agency now sits in DHS. (Congressional and historical overviews emphasize that dual protection/financial-crime mission.) citeturn0search10  

For context, there have even been periodic proposals to move the Secret Service back to Treasury, underscoring how historically linked the two have been. citeturn6view0
