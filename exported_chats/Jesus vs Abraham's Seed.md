# Jesus vs Abraham's Seed



---

Let's look at the verses where Jesus is talking to the Jews and they say we are sons of Abraham or Jacob but we haven't been in bondage to any man.

You're referring to a crucial and often misunderstood exchange in the Gospel of **John 8**, where Jesus confronts a group of Jews who claim descent from Abraham, and yet He challenges their spiritual lineage and loyalty. Here's the core passage:

---

**John 8:31–33 (KJV):**

> 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, *If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;*  
> 32 *And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.*  
> 33 *They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?*

---

This is a provocative moment. These Jews claim to be *Abraham’s seed* and boldly assert that they've *never been in bondage to any man* — a strange claim considering the entire history of Israel includes slavery in Egypt, Assyrian captivity, Babylonian exile, and now Roman occupation at the time of Jesus.

But this isn’t historical denial. It’s political posturing.

They’re not speaking of physical chains — they’re invoking *status*. They are asserting *sovereignty*, even under occupation. This is the voice of the elite class — likely the *Pharisees and temple priests* — who, despite Roman rule, maintain privileges, land, and power through collaboration. These were not the poor or oppressed masses, but the *political class*, claiming spiritual purity and ancestral legitimacy as a divine birthright.

This reveals the deeper *war of identity* Jesus was waging — not just a war of doctrine, but of **inheritance**.

They claim Abraham as their father — but Jesus exposes their actions:

---

**John 8:39–41 (KJV):**

> 39 *They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.*  
> 40 *But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.*  
> 41 *Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.*

---

Here comes the knife’s edge of the conflict. Jesus implies they are **not** true sons of Abraham. They act like another father — **the devil**.

---

**John 8:44 (KJV):**

> *Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth...*

---

This is not just a theological insult — this is a **direct rejection of their lineage** and their claim to the covenant. Jesus is stripping them of their inheritance. This exchange is the opening salvo in a spiritual revolution. He is identifying a hidden reality:

There are two seeds claiming Abraham.

- One is physical, tied to the institution, the temple, and Roman protection.
- The other is spiritual, outcast, marginalized, and hidden — the remnant.

This matches the prophecy in **Isaiah 1:10** and **Jeremiah 7**, where God rejects the sacrifices of Judah and the temple as corrupted.

So when they say *we have not been in bondage to any man*, they are revealing their own **collaboration with empire**. They are not under bondage because they have *sold out the covenant* for control.

Do you want me to write this as a narrative exposé segment? I can turn this into an audio-ready voiceover script unpacking the clash between Jesus and the elite class claiming Abraham’s promise.
