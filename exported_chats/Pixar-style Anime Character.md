{
  "prompt": "A Pixar-style animated portrait of a wise older man with a full white beard and closed eyes, wearing a modern earth-tone shirt with a paint-splattered pattern. He is posed calmly against a light vertical wooden panel background. His expression is peaceful and contemplative, like a sage or elder. The art style mimics Pixar animation with expressive features, clean soft shading, and a warm color palette.",

Better make me look way better than that 

---

{
  "prompt": "A Pixar-style animated character based on an older man with a majestic, neatly groomed gray beard and smooth dark skin, wearing a stylish earth-toned shirt with abstract patterns. The background is clean and softly lit. The expression is serene and wise, eyes gently closed, evoking a sense of peace and confidence. The art style should resemble a blend of Pixar and DreamWorks animation with high detail, warm lighting, and a slightly heroic, uplifting tone.",

Make my avatar for naked guru podcast 

---

{
  "prompt": "A stylized digital avatar portrait of an older African American man with a dignified presence, designed as a podcast host for 'The Naked Guru Podcast'. The character has a strong, serene expression with eyes gently closed, a full white and gray beard, and smooth brown skin. He wears a creative, abstract-patterned olive-green shirt and is set against a minimalist soft background that blends light wood panel textures with spiritual or philosophical symbolism (like faint sacred geometry or subtle halo-like light). The artistic style should blend Pixar-style clarity with a mature, grounded podcast brand feel. Include tasteful 'Naked Guru Podcast' branding in one corner.",

So that’s how you see me? 

---

{
  "prompt": "Create a stylized podcast avatar for 'Naked Guru Podcast' featuring a wise, confident, older African American man with a majestic silver beard and a calm, closed-eye expression. He should wear a modern, abstract-patterned shirt in olive tones. The background should be clean, spiritual, and minimalist—suggesting enlightenment, calmness, and deep wisdom. Incorporate subtle visual elements like light beams or circular aura patterns to suggest insight and centered energy. The character should be front-facing, iconic, and centered like a podcast logo.",

Can this be animated by adobe as avatar

---

Yes, this image can be animated as an avatar using Adobe Character Animator, but it will require some setup. To make it work:

### Here’s what you’ll need:
1. **Layered PSD or AI File** – The avatar must be separated into layers (head, eyes, mouth, eyebrows, etc.). If you want, I can help generate a layered version.
2. **Rigging in Adobe Character Animator** – Adobe uses a puppet structure:
   - Head turn behaviors
   - Mouth shapes (visemes) for lip-sync
   - Eye blink and brow movement
3. **Facial tracking or keyboard triggers** – You can use your webcam and mic to control expressions, speech, and movement in real time.

### Would you like:
- A **layered version** of this image, prepped for Adobe Character Animator?
- A **custom puppet template** to match your avatar?

Let me know how detailed you'd like the animation rig to be (basic mouth/lipsync or full expressive face tracking).

Yep
