# Peter and the Serpent



---



---

Genesis says that the serpent tempted Eve in the garden, there were two trees. Revelation tells you that the serpent is the devil. Jesus also calls Peter the devil. This seems to be an indication where we can link Peter to the teachings of the serpent. In doing so, we find that the serpent is the one who says, you can eat from the other tree and you will not die. Peter likewise is the disciple who says, you can eat all of these foods that God has said not to eat, that they were unclean, because I had a vision. Thank you for watching.

        "This connects Peter to the archetype of the adversary who presents a more palatable but disobedient alternative.",

        "In Acts 10, Peter receives a vision in which he is told to eat animals previously declared unclean, despite resistance based on prior command.",
        "Peter ultimately declares that God has made all things clean, initiating a doctrinal shift that some interpret as contradicting the Torah.",
        "This moment can be viewed as a parallel to the serpent’s assertion that one may eat what God forbade without consequence."

        "Acts 10:13-15 - 'And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.'"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The parallel between Peter’s actions and the serpent’s deception invites a deeper exploration of apostolic authority and fidelity to the original commandments. By identifying the serpent with doctrinal deviation and Peter’s vision with a controversial reinterpretation of divine law, this study raises questions about the continuity and divergence of scriptural teaching across covenants.",
    "key_statements": [
      "The serpent’s claim that disobedience will not lead to death foreshadows future doctrinal shifts that similarly dismiss original commandments.",
      "Jesus’ rebuke of Peter as 'Satan' signals a critical warning against teachings that diverge from the divine path under the guise of compassion or vision.",
      "Peter’s vision in Acts 10 may echo the serpent’s logic: an invitation to eat what was once forbidden without fear of judgment."
