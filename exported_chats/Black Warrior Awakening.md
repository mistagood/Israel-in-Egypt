# Black Warrior Awakening



---

lets talk about Tuskaloosa. I was in Tuscaloosa on a recent visitvand needed to do my daily walks and meditation. I was sent to the University of Alabama where there is a place to park and walk. While there I was seized by the history and discovered that the place was Black Warrior river. I was filled with the spirit of the slain and oppressed ancestors. It was a mystical experience for me. A grandson of Mississippi and Alabama folk, my mother's mother was a cotton picker as a child, born in 1915 Mississippi. My father's father or grandfather is said to have come from Alabama folk. My father's mother is said to be half Seminole and possibly descended from the chief Osceola, as this is her father or grandfather's name. I came up in Los Angeles after my mother moved there when I was 10. Her mother had moved to Chicago when she was a child and there I was born. The warrior spirit awoke in me and soon I was a tall, well built, specimen of a man. So I was a natural target of recruitment for gangs, football coaches and police harassment. By the age of 17 (1991) I was in trouble for fighting 30 guys at one time and being victorious to the point that school authorities feared retaliation from gangs at the school. So I was sent from the urban streets of L.A. to cousins in rural Tuscaloosa, a place I had never heard of. There my first son was born. He is now a towering man over 6'5 or 6'6. Dark skinned with red highlights- a redbone. Me, I take a bronze -red hue darkening with the sun. He was Alabama born and raised by his mother while I continued to be at the whims of the society that forged a warrior and put him in the wind. On the recent visit to Alabama to visit my son and grandaughter is where the story of Black Warrior river picks up. I was shocked to see such a proud remnant of the past displayed there. What does this "black warrior" mean? It was only now more than 30 years after my first visit that I learned that this is the meaning of Tuskaloosa. Only now am I learning the story of the man after whom the city I was sent to (by fate? God?) is named. Only after my research about the native slave trade and reclassification of indigenous peoples as African for continued slave trading and political and economic expediency even after the outlawing of trading 'indian slaves'.  Only now do I understand the spirit that grasped me when I came to the river, that same spirit I felt over 30 years ago when I came 'home' to my people for the first time.

They say names hold power, and Tuskaloosa’s name—Black Warrior—carries the echo of ancestral thunder. I walked along the campus of the University of Alabama, seeking only a place to stretch my legs, when I encountered that mighty name carved into the land’s memory. It was as if the soil beneath my feet and the breeze off the Black Warrior River were whispering an ancient truth meant for my ears alone. My grandmother was born to a Mississippi cotton field in 1915, a child forced into labor while Jim Crow’s hand lay heavy across the land. My father’s family roots twist deep through Alabama, and his mother was said to carry Seminole blood, possibly descended from the great Chief Osceola. Their stories have always traveled with me like half-remembered lullabies, stirring my spirit in unexpected places.

I was ten when my mother swept me from Chicago to Los Angeles, that city of concrete and promise where tall, strong young men with a spark of defiance are called to play football, join gangs, or become targets for the police. By seventeen, I found myself in too many battles, once against thirty men, standing victorious and yet condemned for it. Authorities feared the trouble my presence might provoke, so they sent me away from L.A. to rural Tuscaloosa—my first introduction to that city named for a warrior whose story I knew nothing about. There, in the very place that would one day reveal a piece of my own identity, my first son was born. He grew into a towering man, dark-skinned and kissed with red undertones, a testament to the ancient lineage that flows in our blood.

Returning after three decades, I could feel that old energy awakening again. The hush along the river carried songs of the indigenous who once walked this land, those same people too often mislabeled and forcibly reclassified as “African” when the Indian slave trade was outlawed. The cunning bureaucracy of oppression ensured that the original inhabitants, neither purely African nor purely Indian, were pressed into a single category to keep them in bondage. Those policies sought to bury entire identities, but they couldn’t silence the ancestral spirits anchored in rivers and earth.

Standing beside the Black Warrior River, it all fell into place. The tide of history surged through me: my grandmother’s Mississippi childhood, my father’s Alabama kin, the unbroken line to Seminole resistance, and the powerful legacy of Tuskaloosa himself. That name, Black Warrior, was never just a relic of the past. It was a living challenge—a remembrance to stand tall and unflinching. Now I see how fate, or perhaps some divine hand, guided me back to this place. After all these years, I finally understand the spirit that seized me when I first arrived, the same spirit that roared in my heart when I stood by that river. It’s the spirit of resilience, of the unvanquished warrior who walks this land, still fighting to be recognized and remembered.

we have to tell the story of Tuskaloosa and how it relates to my life

**Drawing inspiration**

I’m crafting a narrative that blends Tuskaloosa's life with personal reflections, exploring how historical themes and Tuskaloosa's legacy resonate through time, possibly linking to biblical narratives and personal lineage.

**Revealing Tuskaloosa's legacy**

I’m piecing together Tuskaloosa's story, highlighting his leadership and battles, including his clash with De Soto. I’m also exploring the origins of Tuskaloosa's name and its potential ties to black and warrior meanings.

**Connecting past and present**

I'm mapping out Tuskaloosa's resistance at the Battle of Mabila and linking it to a personal narrative of forced relocation and the birth of a child in Tuskaloosa.

They say “Tuskaloosa” derives from Choctaw words meaning Black Warrior, yet the name is far more than a mere linguistic artifact. It’s a living emblem of a forgotten hero—a chief who once commanded respect along the waters where modern Alabama now unfolds. The Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto encountered this formidable leader in 1540, and the chronicles record Tuskaloosa as tall, proud, unyielding. The Spanish wanted gold and dominion; he offered neither. What followed was betrayal and bloodshed at the Battle of Mabila, a cataclysm that has almost vanished from textbooks but resonates still in the land’s memory.

I never realized how my life story was intertwined with this legacy until I stood beside the Black Warrior River, feeling a presence as old and deep as the current. My journey began in Mississippi and Alabama through ancestral lines—my grandmother was born in the cotton fields of 1915 Mississippi, my father’s people claimed roots in Alabama, and my father’s mother carried Seminole heritage. As a child, I was uprooted and replanted in Chicago, then later in Los Angeles. There in L.A., by the time I was seventeen, I was hardened by daily battles—literal ones—until school authorities expelled me from the urban chaos, sending me to Tuscaloosa, a place I knew nothing about.

I arrived restless and resentful, my warrior spirit already awakened from too many street skirmishes. What I didn’t understand then was that I’d been guided—by fate or some ancestral hand—into the very arms of the Black Warrior’s country. My first son was born there, and as he grew into a tall man with red highlights in his dark skin, the echoes of Tuskaloosa’s story started to crystallize. I saw in my son’s stature and in my own unquiet soul the living reflection of a history that refuses to die.

Decades later, I return to Tuscaloosa and finally learn of the chief who stood defiantly against conquest. Suddenly, every step on campus, every breeze that ripples across the Black Warrior River, speaks to me of a lineage our world nearly forgot. I think of how Indigenous identities were erased by bureaucratic reclassification—how many were labeled “African” to perpetuate an outlawed slave trade. Layers of subterfuge buried entire nations, turning them into ghosts in official records. Meanwhile, Tuskaloosa’s name remains as a clue, a testament to a warlike ancestor whose legacy can still stir hearts centuries later.

When I gaze upon the water, I imagine Tuskaloosa’s figure—regal, tall, unbowed—reflected alongside my own. I feel him in the marrow of my bones. We both confronted formidable forces: he resisted the Spanish invasion; I resisted the systematic brutality of inner-city streets and the relentless push of a society that forges warriors only to cast them away. In that reflection, I also see my grandmother in the cotton fields, my father’s elusive Alabama roots, and the Seminole blood that battled displacement since the days of Andrew Jackson. All these threads combine to form a tapestry of defiance and survival, woven into the name Black Warrior.

Now, when people ask about Tuscaloosa, I no longer speak merely of a city or a football powerhouse. I tell them about the man behind the name—the warrior whose story has been lost to many but whispers still to those who listen. I speak of how his spirit once seized me as a seventeen-year-old newcomer, planted me in the land of my ancestors, and paved the way for a son who would grow tall and strong in the shadow of that legacy. Tuskaloosa’s tale has become my own, inseparable from the roots that stretch back through generations of hardship and resilience. In the end, the Black Warrior is not just a historical figure or a river’s name; it’s a call to remember who we are and to stand, unbowed, against the currents of time.

Back in 1991, while the world was busy cranking out radio hits and MTV videos, a song emerged that carried a far deeper resonance. “Tennessee” by Arrested Development wasn’t just another hip-hop single; it was a prayer disguised as music, a soulful search for ancestral roots wrapped in an infectious beat. A simple refrain stood out—“Take me to another place, take me to another land…”—and it echoed like prophecy. If you were open to hearing it, it was as though the track beckoned you to rediscover yourself, your history, and your place in the world.

For me, just a teenager at the time, “Tennessee” felt like a direct summons. I was living in the churning landscape of Los Angeles, fresh from a childhood shift from Chicago, balancing the weight of my grandmother’s Mississippi roots and the unspoken call of a father’s Alabama heritage. The school system had labeled me a troublemaker, a warrior in the wrong war. So when the storms rose in my life—thirty guys at my neck, constant battles on campus—and I was exiled to Tuscaloosa, that song’s plea for spiritual grounding took on new meaning. 

Suddenly, I was transported from a world of concrete jungles to humid Southern roads—roads that felt oddly like home. In the lyrics, there was a repeated call to “let me understand your plan.” Arrested Development’s verses spoke of reconnection, of healing the wounds of the past by embracing roots you never knew you had. And there I was, standing at the edges of the Black Warrior River, feeling something ancient stir in my blood, that same spirit that the track pointed to. It’s as if the music had become a map, charting the path back to my family’s land—the place where “Black Warrior” wasn’t just a name but a living presence.

That same year, many young Black men found inspiration in “Tennessee.” Something about the fusion of rap, soul, and gospel undertones gave voice to an ancestral longing that mainstream culture rarely acknowledged. While other songs of the era spoke of partying or street life, “Tennessee” pushed beyond the surface. It was about spiritual questing: sifting through grief and loss, longing for unity, and yearning to stand on the soil where your lineage began.

I was swept up in that longing, even before I fully understood it. Only later, after my run-in with those thirty guys and the subsequent journey to Tuscaloosa, did the cosmic pieces snap into place. Arrested Development’s call to “take me home” was never just about a literal state line—it was about a psychic homecoming, a reconnection with indigenous and African roots blurred by centuries of forced migrations and reclassifications. It’s astonishing that a single song could encapsulate that sense of journey—both the physical relocation and the deeper pilgrimage into identity.

Standing by the Black Warrior River, the memory of those lyrics was like an echo from the universe telling me: Yes, this is your place. Yes, your ancestors prayed you here. And yes, you are connected to something far greater than the chaos you’ve endured. That’s the power of prophecy in music—it vibrates in your bones and slips into your dreams, guiding you even when you don’t recognize its pull.

Looking back, 1991 now seems like a cosmic crossroad. The track “Tennessee” arrived in my ears just as my life was heading toward Tuscaloosa, as if the universe—or God, or fate—had chosen my soundtrack in advance. It reminded me that sometimes you don’t choose the music; the music chooses you. And in that magical instance, the rhythms and rhymes of Arrested Development helped unlock a journey that would connect me to the spirit of Tuskaloosa, the Black Warrior, and the ancestral truths still coursing through my veins.
