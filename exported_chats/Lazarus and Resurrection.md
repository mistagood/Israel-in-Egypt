The Heart of the Matter

The Heart of the Matter

It was not the messiah who died on the cross, but a stand-in called by many names.  Judas, Lazarus, and Jesus. 

- [ ] “so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”
- [ ] BUT— Only one man in the Bible was in the grave for 3 days and 3 nights- and it wasn’t Jesus.  

Lazarus is a peculiar character.  
- [ ] He’s only mentioned in two books of the New Testament. 
    - [ ] Once by Jesus in comparison to the pharisaic rich man.  
    - [ ] And again by John’s gospel. 
    - [ ] Both stories present Lazarus as achieving life after suffering death.  
    - [ ] Yet both dispute resurrection salvation as the correct belief system.  

We’ll unravel this now. 

1.  Lazarus and the Pharisee at the Gate
- [ ] —The beggar dies and is raised up into the bosom of Abraham. 
- [ ] -In John, Lazarus dies and is raised up, as we will show by comparison, into the bosom of Jesus.  
- [ ] -Both stories cast doubt on the Jesus Christ crucifixion and resurrection narrative by the Lord himself rejecting or correcting false  resurrection salvation beliefs.

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Lazarus stands as a central figure who embodies life after death in scripture, distinct from the crucifixion and resurrection narrative. His presence in both Luke and John challenges later doctrines, emphasizing direct restoration through God rather than belief in a sacrificial death-and-resurrection formula. The imagery of being gathered into the bosom—first Abraham’s, then Jesus’—shows continuity in divine relationship without reliance on the cross.",

      "Only Lazarus, not Jesus, is explicitly said to be in the grave three days and three nights.",
