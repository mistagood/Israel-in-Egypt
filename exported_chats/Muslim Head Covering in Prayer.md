# Muslim Head Covering in Prayer

Do Muslims cover their head in prayer?

---



---

Yes, in some Islamic traditions, Muslims cover their heads during prayer, though practices can vary by culture and interpretation. For men, wearing a head covering like a *kufi* or *taqiyah* is common in many regions, signifying respect and modesty before God. However, it is not universally mandated, and many men pray without covering their heads.

For women, it is more standardized across Islamic teachings. Muslim women typically cover their heads with a *hijab*, *shayla*, or *khimar* during prayer, as part of broader guidelines for modest dress in Islam. This practice aligns with the emphasis on modesty and reverence while in prayer and other religious activities.

What about Hebrews?

---

In Hebrew traditions, head coverings during prayer hold significant cultural and religious meaning. For Jewish men, wearing a *kippah* (yarmulke) is a common practice, especially during prayer, as a sign of reverence and acknowledgment of God's presence above. Some Jewish men also wear a *tallit* (prayer shawl) with a head covering during morning prayers or when reciting blessings.

In more traditional or Orthodox Jewish communities, both men and women may cover their heads as a sign of modesty and respect. Married Jewish women often cover their heads with a scarf, hat, or wig (called a *sheitel*) as part of a broader practice of modest dress, though this is more related to everyday modesty rather than specific to prayer.

The covering of the head for both men and women in Hebrew traditions stems from an understanding of humility before God and is often seen as a way to show respect and submission during moments of prayer or religious activity.

What does Moses say?

---

Moses himself does not explicitly command or mention head coverings for prayer in the Torah. However, the broader context of modesty, reverence, and sacred dress is addressed in the laws given to the Israelites, particularly concerning the priesthood. In Exodus 28, Moses receives detailed instructions from God about the garments that the priests, especially the high priest, should wear when ministering in the tabernacle, including a special headpiece called a *mitznefet* (a turban) for the high priest.

These priestly garments were designed to convey holiness and dignity before God, setting a precedent for showing reverence through clothing, though they were specific to the priestly class. For the rest of the Israelites, while the Torah does not mandate head coverings in the way later traditions do, the emphasis on approaching God with respect and humility is clear.

Over time, Jewish traditions developed, and practices like wearing a *kippah* or covering one's head in prayer became symbolic of the reverence and modesty exemplified in the Torah’s teachings, though not directly commanded by Moses.
