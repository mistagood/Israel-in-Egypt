The first laws in the U.S. requiring individuals to carry identification for police enforcement evolved gradually, primarily through vagrancy laws, slave codes, and later through state statutes. Here’s a historical breakdown:

### **1. Slave Codes & Freedmen Papers (Pre-1865)**
- Enslaved Black people were required to carry **slave passes** when traveling away from plantations.
- After Emancipation, **freedmen were often required to carry “freedom papers”** to prove they were not escaped slaves.

### **2. Black Codes (1865–1866)**
- Southern states enacted **Black Codes**, requiring Black individuals to carry **work permits or proof of employment**. If they didn’t, they could be arrested for vagrancy.

### **3. Vagrancy Laws & Stop-and-Frisk (Late 19th to Early 20th Century)**
- Cities passed **vagrancy laws**, allowing police to demand identification or proof of employment, disproportionately targeting Black people, immigrants, and the poor.
- **Loitering and suspicious person laws** enabled police to demand ID or detain individuals without cause.

### **4. World War II: Selective Service Act (1940)**
- The **Selective Training and Service Act of 1940** required men of draft age to carry draft cards as identification.

### **5. Post-War Era: Driver’s Licenses & State ID Laws**
- **The rise of automobiles** in the early 20th century led states to require **driver’s licenses**, effectively becoming a form of government ID.
- **State-issued ID laws** became more common in the mid-20th century as a form of official identification for non-drivers.

### **6. Terry v. Ohio (1968) & the Expansion of Stop-and-Identify Laws**
- **The U.S. Supreme Court upheld “stop-and-frisk”** in *Terry v. Ohio*, ruling police could stop and question people based on reasonable suspicion.
- This led to **"Stop-and-Identify" laws**, allowing police to demand a person’s name if suspected of criminal activity.
- Many states enacted **explicit ID laws**, requiring people to produce identification or face detention.

### **7. The Real ID Act (2005)**
- Set federal standards for state-issued IDs, effectively requiring all citizens to have federally recognized identification.

Today, **some states have Stop-and-Identify laws**, meaning police can demand identification under certain circumstances, while other states do not require ID unless a person is driving or arrested.
