# Nation of Priests Purpose



---



---

A nation of priests refers to a nation becoming, as Levi and Simeon were, to the twelve tribes. And so being made a nation of priests means that just as Levi was scattered throughout the nations, that was done to symbolize that there would be a remnant of Israel scattered throughout the world and they would have the purpose, as Levi's had in Israel, to be priests and to purify or cleanse the world for all the nations that they went to.
