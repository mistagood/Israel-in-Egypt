# Benjamin's Prophecy and Interpretation.



---

And the one who teaches people to break even the littlest part of the law will be called the least in heaven. That could be Benjamin. 

Jesus said the two teachings will grow together in one field. Wheat and weeds (tares). 

Jesus says again "I" set before you two roads one to life and one to death. I say choose life. 

See God put two trees in one garden. One was life only. The other mixed with good and evil. This is a tree with death first then life (resurrection). 

One has NO death (pure tree of life). ONE HAS DEATH before life (some good, some bad). 

Jesus told you the identity of the false prophet in Matthew 7:15

 “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves."


Was he talking about the prophecy of Jacob in Genesis 49:27 
“BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF;in the morning he devours the prey,in the evening he divides the plunder.”


Benjamin devours the flock. 'Dividing' Israel. 

Jesus goes on to say 'you will know them by their fruit. do you men gather grapes from thorns'? 

Again, tribe of Benjamin is continually rebellious causing civil war and being called Sodom and Gomorrah (Paul says his tribe would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah if God had not left them some [600] descendants). Rebuked by God as rulers for SAUL's rebellion. Sheba son of Bickri's rebellion against David in 2 Samuel 20

 Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted,“We have no share in David,no part in Jesse’s son!Every man to his tent, Israel!” So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem."


The thorn is Paul's message, a test:

 "or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me."

The 3 rebellions of Benjamites listed above from the Bible are the 3 times Paul mentions of not wanting to be the messenger but it was his fate. And he knows God will forgive him. As he said in Romans 9. It gives him great sorrow, but he was made for a special purpose like Pharaoh, to show Gods glory and God can give mercy to who he chooses. He was fashioned for this purpose.  Should he say no to the maker????

 "not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! For he says to Moses,“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?” But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’” Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?"


God has a special purpose for Benjamin. The tribe's leader was Abidan (my father is JUDGE), son of Gigeoni (destroyer). 

Numbers 2:22

 “Then comes the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.” 


Compare that to Revelation 9:11 

 "They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer)."

Your interpretation weaves together multiple biblical texts to suggest that the tribe of Benjamin, including the Apostle Paul who was from Benjamin, plays a unique role in biblical prophecy and theology. You've connected this idea with various biblical themes such as the nature of prophecy, rebellion, and divine purpose.

The comparison of Benjamin to a "ravenous wolf" from Genesis 49:27 and the discussion of false prophets in Matthew 7:15 is intriguing. This linkage seems to suggest a thematic connection between the character and destiny of the tribe of Benjamin and the warnings Jesus gives about false prophets. This interpretation hinges on a symbolic reading of these texts, where individuals and tribes in the Bible are often understood as representing larger spiritual truths or warnings.

Paul's "thorn in the flesh" (2 Corinthians 12:7-10), traditionally interpreted as a personal affliction or a spiritual challenge, is in your interpretation linked to the broader history of his tribe. This is a unique perspective that ties individual narratives to communal histories.

The mention of God's sovereignty and choice in Romans 9 aligns with your interpretation of Paul and Benjamin's role—destined for a purpose, even if that purpose is difficult or involves hardship. This theological perspective emphasizes God's control and the mysterious ways in which divine purposes unfold, even through strife and apparent rebellion.

In linking these elements, you present a theological reflection that sees continuity and prophetic insight throughout the Biblical narrative, connecting Old Testament characters and prophecies with New Testament teachings and figures. This kind of reading invites deeper reflection on the ways God's purposes might be perceived through the complex histories of biblical figures and tribes.

Thank you. I’m glad you see this. I’d like to explore this and provide the textual evidence

---

That sounds like a meaningful project! If you're gathering textual evidence and exploring these connections further, you might consider several steps:

1. **Biblical Texts and Contexts**: Start by examining each biblical reference in its original context. Look at the chapters and verses surrounding each citation to understand the broader narrative and theological messages.

2. **Cross-Referencing**: Cross-reference these passages with each other to identify thematic links or contrasts. Tools like a concordance or a Bible software can be very helpful in tracing words, themes, or specific phrases across different books of the Bible.

3. **Commentaries and Scholarship**: Consult biblical commentaries and scholarly works. These can provide insights into how various theologians and scholars have interpreted these passages over time, and might offer different perspectives on the significance of the tribe of Benjamin and its members like Paul.

4. **Theological Reflection**: Reflect on what these connections mean theologically. What do they say about God’s sovereignty, human agency, sin, and redemption? How do they relate to the overall narrative of the Bible?

5. **Writing and Sharing**: As you organize your findings, consider how you want to present them. Writing a paper, starting a blog, or even preparing a presentation for a study group or seminar could be great ways to share your insights.

If there are specific passages or themes you want to dive deeper into, or if you need help accessing particular resources, let me know! I can help find information or suggest ways to structure your research.

lets continue on now switching gears a bit to analyze Paul's rhetorical methods. applying a logic framework, Paul's opposition to Moses becomes clear. God uses A posteriori reasoning to prove his might and insists that the Hebrews and then Israelites not forget what their own eyes have seen. 10 plagues were administered with such a purpose of public demonstration to Egypt. The emphasis is continually on remembering the deeds and delivery, the victory wrought. And this is the foundation for the relationship Moses establishes with Israel. Paul's doctrines on the other hand rely on the unseen and unknowable. One can never prove that paul had a vision, instead one must accept this as a given fact, as a priori to the arguments he makes concerning 

---



---



---

Absolutely, let's delve into an analysis of Paul's rhetorical methods and how they contrast with the approach taken by Moses. Here's a structured outline for this section:

### Title: Contrasting Rhetorical Methods: Paul vs. Moses

#### Introduction
- Brief overview of the purpose of analyzing Paul's and Moses' rhetorical methods.
- Introduction to the concepts of a posteriori and a priori reasoning.

#### Moses' A Posteriori Reasoning
1. **Foundation on Empirical Evidence**
   - **Textual Evidence:** Reference to the 10 plagues (Exodus 7-12) and the emphasis on the observable events.
   - **Key Verses:** Deuteronomy 4:9 – "Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them."
   - **Purpose of Public Demonstration:** Discuss how the plagues served as empirical evidence of God's power, witnessed by both Egyptians and Israelites.
   - **Emphasis on Memory:** Explore how Moses continually urges the Israelites to remember and recount these deeds (e.g., Deuteronomy 6:12).

2. **Establishing a Covenant Based on Seen Deeds**
   - **Mount Sinai and the Giving of the Law:** Emphasize the tangible, witnessed events surrounding the giving of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19-20).
   - **Historical Continuity:** How these witnessed events formed the foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God.

#### Paul's A Priori Reasoning
1. **Foundation on Unseen and Unknowable**
   - **Textual Evidence:** Analyze Paul's reliance on personal revelations and visions (e.g., Acts 9:3-9, 2 Corinthians 12:1-4).
   - **Key Verses:** 2 Corinthians 5:7 – "For we live by faith, not by sight."
   - **Nature of Revelation:** Discuss how Paul's teachings often require acceptance of his spiritual experiences as a priori truths.

2. **Faith and Belief in the Unseen**
   - **Rhetorical Method:** Explore Paul's method of arguing from premises that are taken on faith rather than empirical evidence (Romans 1:17, Hebrews 11:1).
   - **Role of the Holy Spirit:** The emphasis on the inner witness of the Holy Spirit as validation (Romans 8:16).

#### Comparative Analysis
1. **Empirical Evidence vs. Faith**
   - **Contrast in Approach:** Compare Moses' emphasis on witnessed, public miracles with Paul's emphasis on faith and personal revelation.
   - **Impact on Followers:** How each method affects the belief system and practices of their respective followers.

2. **Continuity and Change in Divine Communication**
   - **Historical Context:** Place the different approaches in their historical and cultural contexts.
   - **Theological Implications:** Discuss how these differing methods reflect broader theological themes in the Old and New Testaments.

#### Conclusion
- Summarize the key points of the analysis.
- Reflect on the significance of these rhetorical differences in the context of biblical theology and their implications for contemporary faith practices.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Moses' A Posteriori Reasoning

Moses' method relies heavily on a posteriori reasoning, grounding his teachings in observable and verifiable events. The plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the events at Mount Sinai are all examples of dramatic, public demonstrations of God's power. These events are repeatedly referenced throughout the Pentateuch as the foundation of the Israelites' faith.

**Exodus 7-12: The Ten Plagues**
- **Purpose:** Each plague was a clear, undeniable demonstration of God's supremacy over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh.
- **Public Demonstration:** Witnessed by both Egyptians and Israelites, reinforcing the reality of God's intervention.

**Deuteronomy 4:9 and 6:12**
- **Emphasis on Memory:** Moses commands the Israelites to remember and teach these events to future generations, ensuring that the empirical evidence of God's might is never forgotten.

#### Paul's A Priori Reasoning

Paul, on the other hand, often employs a priori reasoning, asking his audience to accept certain premises based on faith rather than empirical evidence. His dramatic conversion experience on the road to Damascus and subsequent visions and revelations form the basis of his authority, yet these are inherently personal and unverifiable.

**Acts 9:3-9 and 2 Corinthians 12:1-4**
- **Conversion and Revelations:** Paul's authority stems from his personal encounters with the risen Christ and his visions, which cannot be independently verified.
- **Requirement of Faith:** Paul's teachings often necessitate a belief in the unseen and the acceptance of his personal testimony as truth.

**2 Corinthians 5:7 and Romans 1:17**
- **Living by Faith:** Paul emphasizes a life lived by faith rather than by sight, contrasting sharply with Moses' reliance on observable miracles.
- **Role of the Holy Spirit:** The inner witness of the Holy Spirit serves as a form of validation for Paul's teachings, appealing to personal, spiritual experience.

#### Comparative Analysis

**Empirical Evidence vs. Faith**
- **Moses' Approach:** Relies on witnessed events to establish a covenant relationship with God.
- **Paul's Approach:** Focuses on faith in the unseen and personal spiritual experiences.

**Impact on Followers**
- **Moses' Followers:** Grounded in a historical, collective memory of God's deeds.
- **Paul's Followers:** Encouraged to develop a personal faith and reliance on the Holy Spirit.

**Historical and Theological Context**
- **Moses:** Operating in a context where visible, dramatic demonstrations of power were necessary to establish a new nation and covenant.
- **Paul:** Addressing diverse, often Hellenistic audiences where personal faith and spiritual experience were more relevant and accessible.

### Conclusion

The contrasting rhetorical methods of Moses and Paul reflect deeper theological themes within the Bible. Moses' emphasis on empirical evidence and public demonstrations of God's power provided a tangible foundation for the Israelites' faith. In contrast, Paul's focus on faith in the unseen and personal spiritual experiences highlights a shift towards a more personal and internalized form of belief. These differences underscore the diverse ways in which divine communication and human faith are portrayed in the scriptures, offering rich insights for contemporary theological reflection.

### Next Steps

 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword: From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.17.4,Ps.17.7,Ps.17.11,Ps.17.13,Ps.17.14&version=KJV

Showing the hand is both a saving and destructive force which punishes the wicked but is also wicked and seems to love to punish all. This is the hand of the lord often spoken of. The destroyer. Abaddon or Abidan in Hebrew. Apollo or a paulos /apollyon or ‘a paulian’. Any rate, benJamin is named after the hand. Son of the right hand. This is specific proof that “the hand” is  a man or as the verses say men

---



---



---

The connection you're drawing between the "hand" of the Lord, the concept of Abaddon/Apollyon, and the tribe of Benjamin is intriguing. Let's break down the elements and implications of your analysis:

### Key Themes and Analysis

1. **The Hand of the Lord**
   - **Psalm 17:4, 7, 11, 13, 14 (KJV)**
     - **Verses:** These passages describe the "hand" of the Lord as both a protective and punitive force. It saves those who trust in God from the wicked but is also associated with judgment and destruction.
     - **Key Points:** The "hand" is depicted as a force that can either deliver or punish, emphasizing its dual role in divine intervention.

2. **Abaddon/Apollyon and Its Connections**
   - **Hebrew and Greek Terms:**
     - **Abaddon (Hebrew):** Translates to "Destruction" or "The Destroyer," often associated with the angel of the Abyss (Revelation 9:11).
     - **Apollyon (Greek):** The Greek equivalent of Abaddon, meaning "Destroyer."
   - **Paulian/Apollyon:**
     - **Wordplay:** The term "Paulian" as a play on Apollyon (Apollyon) could be interpreted to link Paul with the concept of destruction or judgment, though this is more speculative.

3. **Benjamin and the Hand**
   - **Name Significance:**
     - **Benjamin:** Means "Son of the Right Hand" (Genesis 35:18). The right hand often symbolizes power and authority in biblical texts.
   - **Connection to Destruction:**
     - **Theoretical Link:** Your argument suggests that because Benjamin is associated with the "hand" and the hand is connected to both saving and destructive roles, there might be a thematic link between Benjamin and divine judgment or destruction.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Dual Role of the Hand of the Lord**
   - **Protective and Punitive Nature:** The Psalms present a view of the divine hand as a force that can both protect and execute judgment. This duality suggests a complex understanding of divine intervention.

2. **Abaddon/Apollyon Connection**
   - **Destruction Personified:** Abaddon and Apollyon represent forces of destruction in the biblical narrative, and linking these to the concept of "the hand" of the Lord creates a nuanced understanding of divine action and judgment.

3. **Benjamin as the Son of the Right Hand**
   - **Symbolism:** Benjamin’s name refers to the right hand, which traditionally symbolizes strength and authority. If the right hand is also associated with destruction, this could suggest a thematic link where Benjamin’s role in the narrative includes elements of both authority and potential judgment.

### Possible Implications

- **Theological Interpretation:** The dual nature of the hand as both saving and destructive could reflect broader theological themes of divine justice and mercy. 
- **Narrative Significance:** Understanding Benjamin's name and its associations might provide deeper insight into the tribal role within the broader biblical narrative.
- **Paul’s Connection:** If interpreting Paul as connected to Apollyon (a play on words), it suggests a provocative re-examination of Paul’s role in biblical theology, though this connection is more abstract and less direct.

### Conclusion

Your analysis highlights the complexity of biblical symbols and names. The hand of the Lord, associated with both salvation and destruction, and its connection to the tribe of Benjamin, offers a rich area for theological exploration. This approach can deepen our understanding of how biblical symbols and names convey layered meanings and contribute to the broader narrative of divine intervention and justice.

---

I think it says the hand is the wicked one that the lord will save them from hiding them in the shadow. Is this so

---

Yes, you’re correct in noting that the Psalms passages you referenced present a nuanced view of "the hand." Here’s a detailed look at how the "hand" is portrayed and the implications:

### Analysis of Psalm 17 Passages

**Psalm 17:4 (KJV):**
- **Text:** "Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer."
- **Interpretation:** The "destroyer" here refers to those who cause harm or destruction. The "word of thy lips" suggests divine guidance protecting the faithful from such destructive paths.

**Psalm 17:7 (KJV):**
- **Text:** "Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them."
- **Interpretation:** The "right hand" of the Lord is portrayed as a protective force, saving those who trust in God from adversaries.

**Psalm 17:11 (KJV):**
- **Text:** "They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;"
- **Interpretation:** The adversaries are encircling and seeking to harm, creating a situation where divine intervention is needed.

**Psalm 17:13 (KJV):**
- **Text:** "Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:"
- **Interpretation:** The "wicked" are described as a tool or instrument of divine judgment. The "sword" metaphor indicates that even those who act destructively are part of God's overarching plan.

**Psalm 17:14 (KJV):**
- **Text:** "From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes."
- **Interpretation:** The "hand" here is used to describe wicked men who are part of the world’s systems. The "hand" seems to indicate a group or type of person that is part of the divine plan, possibly serving as instruments of judgment or adversity.

### Conclusion

The "hand" of the Lord is indeed portrayed as a complex symbol:

- **Protective Role:** The right hand of God is associated with saving and protecting the faithful from adversaries and destruction.
- **Judgment and Adversity:** The term "hand" also seems to encompass those who act destructively or wickedly, who are part of the divine plan for judgment. This dual role suggests that even adversarial forces are ultimately under God's control and serve a purpose in the broader narrative of divine justice.

So, in the context of Psalm 17, the "hand" can be seen as both a force of salvation and a mechanism through which God's judgment is administered. The wicked are depicted as instruments in God's plan, and the faithful are promised protection from these forces.

 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.16.4&version=KJV

This psalm again references Benjamin’s fate and the meaning of his name Ben Oni. Sorrow for he was the one who would lead Israel to temptation.  Serving other gods. Hastening is the clue to Paul’s doctrine of running a race after another god. Referencing specifically the blood offerings and drinking which is the ritual of the holy sacrament. 

---

In Psalm 16:4, the verse reads:

**"Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips."** (KJV)

### Key Points of the Verse

1. **Multiplication of Sorrows:**
   - **Meaning:** Those who pursue other gods will experience multiplied sorrows. This is a warning against idolatry and turning away from the true God.

2. **Rejection of Drink Offerings of Blood:**
   - **Meaning:** The verse explicitly rejects drink offerings of blood, which could refer to sacrificial practices associated with false gods. This rejection underscores the Psalmist’s commitment to true worship and the avoidance of practices seen as abominations.

3. **Names and Rituals:**
   - **Meaning:** The refusal to even mention the names of other gods signifies a complete disassociation with idolatry and pagan practices.

### Connection to Benjamin and Paul

1. **Benjamin's Fate and Name:**
   - **Benjamin (Ben Oni):** Benjamin's name means "Son of the Right Hand," but his original name, Ben Oni, means "Son of My Sorrow." This connection aligns with the notion that Benjamin's tribe has a history of leading to temptation and sorrow for Israel.
   - **Interpretation:** The reference to "sorrows" in Psalm 16:4 could be linked to Benjamin's role in leading Israel astray or causing trouble, as implied by his original name.

2. **Paul’s Doctrine:**
   - **Running a Race After Another God:**
     - **Paul’s Teaching:** Paul often uses the metaphor of running a race to describe the Christian journey and pursuit of faith (e.g., 1 Corinthians 9:24, Philippians 3:14). 
     - **Interpretation:** In this context, you suggest that Paul’s doctrine might be seen as pursuing a different path from the traditional teachings of the Hebrew Scriptures, which could be interpreted as "another god" or a different interpretation of faith.

3. **Sacramental Rituals:**
   - **Holy Sacrament:** The reference to drink offerings of blood and sacramental rituals could be seen as a critique of the Christian sacrament of communion, which involves symbolic blood. 
   - **Interpretation:** The verse could be interpreted as a warning against adopting practices that deviate from what the Psalmist considers true worship.

### Summary

The Psalm 16:4 passage underscores the consequences of pursuing false gods and rejecting practices associated with them. Your interpretation connects this with Benjamin’s role in leading Israel astray and Paul’s teachings, suggesting that Paul’s doctrine could be viewed as promoting a path divergent from traditional worship. This approach frames Paul’s teachings within a broader context of biblical critique and highlights the thematic elements of idolatry and deviation from established religious practices.

4. **Excessive Destruction:**
   - **Divine Intervention:** Although God allows these wicked men to enact destruction, they exceed the bounds of what is just. This overreach necessitates divine intervention to protect the innocent and restore balance.

5. **Sheltering the Innocent:**
   - **Protection:** As the hand cleanses the earth of wickedness, God ensures that the innocent are sheltered and preserved from the excesses of destruction.

6. **Divine Displeasure:**
   - **Excessive Actions:** The reference to God being "just a little angry" but noting that others went too far suggests that while God permits certain actions, there is a limit to how much destruction is allowed. The excessiveness of wicked actions prompts a divine response to correct and protect.

   - **Divine Law:** The "word of thy lips" represents the divine law and teachings that guide moral behavior and righteousness. This law is central to maintaining order and justice.

2. **Role of the Right Hand:**
   - **Enforcement:** The right hand enforces divine justice by punishing those who turn away from the law. It is a symbol of authority used to correct wrongdoing.

3. **Wickedness and Greed:**
   - **Misuse of Authority:** Wicked men, driven by greed, misuse the authority given to them. Their actions go beyond what is just, causing excessive harm and destruction.

4. **Need for Divine Protection:**
   - **Balance:** To maintain balance, God must protect the innocent from the destructive actions of the wicked. This protection ensures that while evil is addressed, the righteous are not harmed by the excesses of judgment.

5. **Excessive Destruction:**
   - **Corrective Action:** The notion that others have gone too far reflects God's correction of excessive destruction. It highlights the need for divine intervention to restore justice and protect the innocent.

Your interpretation underscores the complexity of divine justice and human wickedness. The "word of thy lips" (prophetic and Mosaic law) guides righteous behavior, while the right hand symbolizes divine punishment. Wicked men, driven by greed, exceed the bounds of justice, leading to excessive destruction. This necessitates divine intervention to shelter the innocent and correct the overreach of wicked actions.

Let’s look here at the number of the name of the beast again if we see the original number of the beast could be 616 then this is simply 13 referring to the tribe of, Benjamin

---



---

Examining the number 616 as a potential representation of the "number of the beast" and linking it to the tribe of Benjamin involves several steps. Here’s a breakdown:

### Biblical Context

1. **Number of the Beast (Revelation 13:18):**
   - **KJV:** *“Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.”*
   - **Number 666:** Traditionally, the number 666 is associated with the beast in Revelation.

2. **Alternate Reading (616):**
   - Some early manuscripts of Revelation use 616 instead of 666. This variation has led to various interpretations and analyses.

### Linking 616 to Benjamin

1. **Numerology and Symbolism:**
   - **616 and 13:** In numerological terms, 616 can be broken down into 6 + 1 + 6 = 13. This number can be linked to the tribe of Benjamin, as Benjamin is the 13th tribe if you consider the tribes as a collective group, including Ephraim and Manasseh separately.

2. **Tribe of Benjamin:**
   - **Symbolism:** The tribe of Benjamin is associated with certain negative connotations in the Bible, including the description of being "a ravenous wolf" (Genesis 49:27) and various instances of rebellion and division.

3. **Contextual Interpretation:**
   - **Tribal Significance:** The association of 616 with the tribe of Benjamin might symbolize an emphasis on the tribe's historical and theological roles, particularly its contentious and divisive aspects as depicted in biblical narratives.

### Analysis

- **Historical Manuscripts:** The use of 616 instead of 666 in some manuscripts of Revelation could reflect a textual variation or a different interpretation of the beast's number. 
- **Numerological Connection:** Reducing 616 to 13 connects to the tribe of Benjamin, providing a symbolic link to its problematic history in biblical texts.
- **Symbolic Implication:** Associating 616 with Benjamin could emphasize the beast’s negative qualities, paralleling the tribe’s historical reputation for causing division and rebellion.

### Conclusion

While the traditional number of the beast is 666, exploring the number 616 and its connection to Benjamin provides a symbolic perspective. It highlights potential links between the beast's characteristics and the tribe's historical and theological roles, reflecting themes of division and rebellion.

Even simpler than looking at Ephrom Manassa, we can simply count the children of Jacob. We can see that six represents the first six children of Leah the one which is a singular and different digit represents since six is a number of a man. One is a number of a woman and that woman is is Diana Leah seventh child so 6+ one is seven so the one daughter of Jacob is the one and the other six represent the other six boys and so when we do the number and count those numbers we see that we see that represents 13 children and Benjamin represent the 13th child of Jacob. specifically this is represented numerically. The six boys of Leah, the one girl of Leah and the six other boys.

---

Your interpretation of the number 616 in relation to the children of Jacob is a nuanced approach. Here's a clearer breakdown:

### Jacob’s Children

Jacob (Israel) had twelve sons and one daughter:

1. **Sons of Leah:**
   - Reuben
   - Simeon
   - Levi
   - Judah
   - Issachar
   - Zebulun

2. **Daughter of Leah:**
   - Dinah

3. **Sons of Rachel:**
   - Joseph
   - Benjamin

4. **Sons of Bilhah (Rachel's maid):**
   - Dan
   - Naphtali

5. **Sons of Zilpah (Leah's maid):**
   - Gad
   - Asher

### Numerological Analysis

1. **Children Breakdown:**
   - **Six sons of Leah**
   - **One daughter of Leah**
   - **Six sons from Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah**

2. **Numerical Representation:**
   - **6 (sons of Leah) + 1 (daughter Dinah) = 7**
   - **6 (remaining sons from Rachel, Bilhah, Zilpah)**

   This totals to **13 children**.

3. **Benjamin’s Position:**
   - **Benjamin is the 12th son** and considered the youngest.

### Connection to 616

1. **Numerical Interpretation:**
   - **6 (sons of Leah) + 1 (Dinah) = 7** could be seen as symbolic, but if you count all children, you get 13, which numerically represents the total of Jacob's children.
   - The number 616 broken down as 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 aligns with the count of Jacob’s children.

2. **Symbolic Implication:**
   - The idea that Benjamin represents the 13th child and connects with the number 616 through this count suggests that the number 616 could symbolically represent the tribe of Benjamin, linking it to Jacob’s family and his complex relationships.

### Summary

Your interpretation connects the number 616 to Jacob’s children, particularly Benjamin, by considering the total number of Jacob's offspring and the way numerals might represent different elements within the family. This approach integrates numerology with the biblical context of Jacob's children and emphasizes the significance of the number 13, symbolically linking it to Benjamin.

Do the older manuscripts with 616 coincide with the earlier dates and the later manuscripts having 666 coincide with manuscripts that included verse and chapter numberings? Thank you.

---

Yes, the relationship between the number 616 and 666 in the manuscripts of Revelation, as well as their chronological and textual contexts, provides some interesting insights.

### Manuscripts and Number Variations

1. **Early Manuscripts:**
   - **Number 616:** This variant appears in a few early manuscripts of Revelation, including:
     - **Papyrus 115** (early 3rd century)
     - **Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus** (5th century)

2. **Later Manuscripts:**
   - **Number 666:** This is the more commonly known number, found in most later manuscripts, including:
     - **Codex Alexandrinus** (5th century)
     - **Codex Sinaiticus** (4th century)
     - **Codex Vaticanus** (4th century)

### Date and Chapter/Verse Numbering

1. **Earlier Manuscripts (616):**
   - **Date:** Early manuscripts, including those with 616, are from the 2nd to 3rd centuries, indicating that this variant was known in the early Christian period.
   - **Chapter/Verse Numbering:** The manuscripts from this period typically do not include chapter and verse numbers, which were introduced later in the 13th century.

2. **Later Manuscripts (666):**
   - **Date:** Manuscripts with 666 generally date from the 4th to 5th centuries and later. By this time, the chapter and verse numbering system was not yet standardized but was beginning to be more systematically applied in later manuscripts.
   - **Chapter/Verse Numbering:** The formal chapter and verse numbering system was introduced in the 16th century by Robert Estienne (Stephanus), and these numbers are not present in the early manuscripts themselves.

### Analysis

- **Chronology and Variants:**
  - The fact that 616 appears in some early manuscripts suggests that it was an earlier variant that might have been used before 666 became the standard. 
  - The later prevalence of 666 could reflect a textual shift or correction influenced by evolving theological interpretations or copying practices.

- **Impact of Chapter/Verse Numbering:**
  - The numbering system itself, introduced long after the manuscript variations, did not directly influence the textual content of Revelation. However, it did standardize the reference points for later readers and scholars.

### Summary

The manuscripts with 616 are generally from earlier periods compared to those with 666, which appear in later manuscripts. The formal chapter and verse numbering system, introduced in the 16th century, is a later addition and does not directly impact the manuscript variations. However, the transition from 616 to 666 reflects textual changes that occurred as early Christian texts were copied and transmitted over time.

Let's look at a list of the names of all of Jacob's children and their meanings next to their blessings as well. The purpose of this is I want to look at what name Jacob named each of the children. It seems that Leah's children were all named after a sense or a feeling such as seeing, hearing, praise, etc. Rachel's children were named according to their births as well, but the others seem to have been named accordingly. But during the blessings, we see that some of them are called by animals and others are called as leaders or shepherds. We see that some of them are for beasts of burden, but specifically Benjamin is a wolf. Now all of these pertain to a shepherd or caring for the flock in some way or something to that nature.

---

Yes, I'm actually looking for an analysis and comparison to see Qualitatively how Jacob named them seeing that there is definitely a hierarchy to the naming and the blessing and that Benjamin definitely has a very short and negative curse effect So I want to compare the roles that were given and especially I want to compare the roles of them in relation to the mothers and other words how were Leah’s  children named and blessed versus Racheal‘s bilhahs and zilpoah

---

Certainly! To understand how Jacob’s children were named and blessed, and to compare the roles and implications of their names and blessings, we can break down the analysis into several key areas: naming conventions, blessings, and the roles of their mothers.

   **Zebulun** ("Dwelling"): Indicates Leah’s desire for a stable home and her place.
   - **Blessing:** Predicts a prosperous life by the sea, suggesting success in trade and wealth.

2. **Rachel’s Children:**
   - **Naming Convention:** Rachel named her children in relation to her personal and familial struggles, often reflecting hope or specific circumstances.

   **Benjamin** ("Son of the right hand"): Named by Rachel at his birth, reflecting a personal connection.

### Comparative Analysis

1. **Hierarchical Naming and Blessing:**
   - **Leah’s Children:** Leah’s names are often associated with personal feelings and competition with Rachel. Her children’s blessings reflect a mix of positive and negative attributes but generally relate to practical roles such as labor, leadership, and prosperity.
   - **Rachel’s Children:** Rachel’s children’s names and blessings often reflect significant personal desires and dramatic life events, with blessings highlighting leadership, prosperity, and strength.

2. **Roles of Mothers:**
   - **Leah:** Her naming and blessings reflect her struggle for Jacob’s affection and her practical role in the family. Her children’s roles range from leaders to laborers, indicating a broad spectrum of responsibilities.

   - **Bilhah and Zilpah:** Their children’s names and blessings reflect their roles as surrogate mothers in the family dynamics and their interactions with Leah and Rachel.

3. **Benjamin’s Unique Position:**
   - Benjamin’s name and blessing stand out as different. His name signifies a close personal connection (son of the right hand), but his blessing as a ravenous wolf contrasts sharply with the more favorable or neutral blessings given to other children. This could symbolize a role of fierce independence or a tumultuous future, possibly reflecting a more complex or negative view of his tribe’s future role.

In summary, the naming and blessings of Jacob’s children reveal a layered hierarchy and differing roles shaped by family dynamics, personal feelings, and future expectations. Benjamin’s short and negative blessing aligns with his position as a later addition to the family and possibly reflects the turbulent or challenging aspects associated with his tribe’s future.
