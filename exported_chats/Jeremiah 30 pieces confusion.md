# Jeremiah 30 pieces confusion

Matthew 27.9 talks about 30 pieces of silver that Jeremiah spoke of. Where does Jeremiah speak of 30 pieces?

Good question. Matthew 27:9 says:

> *“Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, ‘And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value…’”*  

The difficulty is that Jeremiah **does not mention “thirty pieces of silver”** anywhere in his book. The direct wording comes instead from **Zechariah 11:12–13**:

> *“So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.”*

### How this is usually explained:
1. **Scribal or textual attribution** – Many scholars suggest Matthew meant *Zechariah*, but “Jeremiah” was written either by error or because Jeremiah’s scroll was the first in the prophetic section of the Hebrew canon (so “Jeremiah” could stand for the whole section of the Prophets).
   
2. **Blending prophecies** – Some argue Matthew deliberately fused **Jeremiah 19 (the potter’s field and broken pot imagery)** with **Zechariah 11 (the 30 pieces of silver)**. That way he connects Judas’ betrayal money with Jeremiah’s symbolic field.

   - **Jeremiah 19:1–13**: Jeremiah buys a potter’s earthen bottle and breaks it in the valley of Hinnom, symbolizing judgment.
   - **Jeremiah 32:6–15**: Jeremiah also purchases a field as a prophetic sign of restoration.

3. **Thematic resonance** – Jeremiah speaks often of blood, fields, judgment, and betrayal of covenant, which Matthew may have seen as fulfilled in Judas’ act, even if the exact number “thirty” comes only from Zechariah.

### Summary
- **The number “thirty pieces of silver” is from Zechariah 11:12–13, not Jeremiah.**
- **Jeremiah’s role** in Matthew 27:9 may be either a textual shorthand for the prophets, a deliberate fusion of Jeremiah and Zechariah, or a scribal slip that entered the tradition.

Would you like me to lay out a verse-by-verse **side-by-side comparison** of Jeremiah 19, Jeremiah 32, and Zechariah 11 with Matthew 27 so you can see how Matthew might have blended them?
