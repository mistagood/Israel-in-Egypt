# Revelation and Matthew Interpretation



---

Rev 9

And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

“saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.” Cross reference Matthew 16:18-19

“And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades[u] will not overpower it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”

The passage from Revelation 9:1-2, when cross-referenced with Matthew 16:18-19, offers a provocative lens to interpret the opening of the bottomless pit and the role of Peter in spiritual warfare and deception. Here's a detailed interpretation and analysis:

---

### **Revelation 9:1-2: The Star, the Key, and the Bottomless Pit**
The imagery in Revelation describes a star falling from heaven to earth, a being who is given the "key of the bottomless pit." When the pit is

Rev 9

And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

“saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.” Cross reference Matthew 16:17,18-19

17 And Jesus answered him,[s] “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood[t] did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven! 

“And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades[u] will not overpower it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”

Cross reference Daniel 3:28,34,44-45

However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries,[aq] and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the times to come.[ar]


God has revealed this to Peter and Nebuchadnezzar.  Both leaders who go astray but are ultimately brought back. Just as Jonah went astray and was brought back. 

Peter’s church/kingdom is the stone of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. 

Keys to heaven and the bottomless pit.  
Peter is the star that falls rev 9:1 (fallen angel) leading to war.  Oil is the bottomless pit (burning, sulfur, ash, etc) The harnessing of oil leads a tree described a revelation, chapter 9 verse two of a great furnace that darken the sun in the air pollution. These allow the forces of war to proliferate and to conquer all of Europe and the rest of the world decimating the previous kingdoms as described in Daniel.

We see the first three of revelation nine states that out with the smoke came these weapons of war that had wings that sound like the chariots of many horses running to battle. 



Interpretation: War unleashed through Peter’s throne (holy wars of the 20th century)

We see that the harnessing of the forces of the bottomless pit lead to leader ship which manipulates the people into supporting wars that helped them to conquer and dominate the Earth while claiming to be fighting against tyranny and the forces of evil.  

The set of force the sets in motion, the perpetuation of war and escalation as war as a bottomless pit leading to the enrichment of uranium or as strong 3772 explains ouranos or Uranus the source of our word uranium. a star, falling from Heaven, gives the imagery of a nuclear or atomic bomb, falling to the Earth and creating a gaping hole. 

Revelation 911 references the king they had over them as followers of Paul’s doctrine, which allowed the forces of Europe to Cole, less under the sign of the cross which references the one who Daniel speaks of who abandoned the covenant and gains his way through flatteries. These are the gates of hell that Jesus says won’t prevail since Paul took peters mission to the Gentiles and instead proliferated a doctrine of resurrection, salvation through the cross.  This cross was used by Hitler and the United States to conquer and dominate the world. But just as Jonah disobey God running away on a ship, and God tossed the waves and caused storms. The same thing happened with Paul was on his way to Rome, and ultimately the message will be corrected, and the gates of hell will not prevail. 

---

Revelation 9 opens a vivid symbolic window into a pivotal moment in human and spiritual history. Through cross-referencing with Matthew 16:17-19 and Daniel 2, the imagery of the fallen star, the bottomless pit, and the rise of war takes on profound meaning, pointing to the manipulation of leadership, the proliferation of destructive forces, and the eventual correction of misguided paths.

---

### **The Fallen Star and the Bottomless Pit (Revelation 9:1-2)**  
The "star fallen from heaven" in Revelation 9:1 symbolizes a leader entrusted with immense authority, reflected in the "key to the bottomless pit." When cross-referenced with Matthew 16:17-19, Peter emerges as a parallel figure, receiving "the keys of the kingdom of heaven." However, Peter's role is not unblemished. Like Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2), Peter strays from divine intent, leading to outcomes that unleash forces of war, deceit, and chaos, symbolized by the opening of the abyss.

The pit represents a boundless source of destruction, identified here as the "harnessing of oil"—an industry rooted in fire and sulfur, polluting the skies and fueling global warfare. The imagery of smoke darkening the sun and air is evocative of environmental devastation and the proliferation of industrialized war, as seen in the 20th century.

---

### **Peter's Throne and War Through Deception**  
Jesus declares in Matthew 16:18-19 that Peter's church will withstand the gates of Hades. Yet the same Peter, prone to human weakness, becomes symbolic of the star in Revelation 9:1, falling and unleashing forces that lead to war. The reference to "gates of Hades" and the bottomless pit suggests a dual role: one of leadership and one of vulnerability to deceit. 

The Strong's Greek references, particularly *phrenapatao* (5422), meaning "to delude" or "deceive," indicate that leadership tied to Peter's church can mislead, steering humanity toward chaos. This aligns with Paul's manipulation of Peter's mission, introducing doctrines that embolden conquest under the banner of the cross. Daniel 11:32 describes such leadership: "He will corrupt those who violate the covenant with flatteries."

---

### **Nebuchadnezzar's Dream and the Bottomless Pit**  
In Daniel 2, Nebuchadnezzar's vision of a stone "cut without hands" destroying a great statue represents the establishment of God’s eternal kingdom. Peter, identified as the "rock" by Jesus, could have been this stone. Yet, like Jonah fleeing his mission, Peter's spiritual lineage is misdirected, leading to conquest rather than restoration. The bottomless pit becomes a metaphor for endless war, fueled by oil and uranium—"a gaping hole" of destruction.

---

### **Revelation 9:3-10: Modern Warfare Unleashed**  
Out of the smoke arise locust-like creatures equipped for battle, described as having "wings like chariots of many horses running to battle." This imagery parallels the mechanized warfare of the 20th century: tanks, planes, and missiles. These weapons, powered by the abyss (oil and enriched uranium), represent the destructive reach of modern technology.

The forces of war, under the guise of righteousness, devastate the earth. Peter's keys, initially meant to unlock the kingdom of heaven, are twisted into a means of dominion, fulfilling the prophecy of deception (*phrenapates*), leading humanity astray.

---

### **The Cross and Conquest: Paul's Doctrine and Revelation 9:11**  
Revelation 9:11 introduces the king of destruction: "Abaddon" in Hebrew, "Apollyon" in Greek. This figure represents those who corrupt the covenant, consolidating power under false pretense. The cross, an emblem of Paul's resurrection doctrine, became a banner for conquest. From Hitler’s swastika to the Christian empires' wars, the cross is tied to domination and the perpetuation of false teachings.

Daniel 11 and Revelation 9 converge in depicting leaders who exploit faith to justify tyranny. Yet, just as Jonah was corrected and returned to God's mission, so too will the deception unravel, and truth prevail.

---

### **Conclusion: The Gates of Hell Will Not Prevail**  
Despite the unleashing of the abyss and the chaos of war, Jesus' declaration to Peter offers hope: "The gates of Hades will not overpower it." This promise ensures that though Peter's lineage has stumbled and Paul's doctrine has proliferated, the true message of God will emerge. Revelation 9 symbolizes not just destruction but a warning and a turning point.

The star fallen from heaven, representing leadership gone astray, will be redeemed as humanity returns to divine truth. The forces unleashed from the abyss—oil, uranium, and war—will be curtailed, and the kingdom prophesied in Daniel will be established, "cut without hands" and enduring forever.

---

Okay, this is good as a starting point. Let's keep all this as an outline, and then I want to go much deeper on all of it and expand. So, for instance, where Jesus begins and asks, Who do people say I am? Peter says, You're the Son of God. Now, until this point, in the book of Matthew, only demons have recognized Jesus as Son of God. He hasn't said this to anyone. And this is actually not a Hebrew idea. But Jesus knows that this is the pathway that this is going to take. And so this is how this message is going to go to the Gentiles. And so this message, this has been revealed to Peter as the one who would obviously be the perfect emissary to the Gentiles. Of course, Jesus later talks about Peter being the hired hand and Paul as the wolf of the tribe of Benjamin. He runs away when the wolf comes because he's a hired hand. But the point here being that Jesus recognizes this and says that this is from God, just as God had revealed to Nebuchadnezzar, as Daniel says. So it sets up the comparison for us to understand that we're going into talking about the wars and the last time, the last days, what is going to progress as kingdoms rise and fall until the end time and this ultimate kingdom is established. Now, he calls him son of Jonah at this time. And we can recognize that he is comparing him now to Jonah and saying that the message is going to be derailed just as Jonah was sent but ran away. Peter is now notably the one who is depicted as running away later from the crucifixion when the guards testimony denies Christ three times. So we have now this imagery of Peter as a son of Jonah or a likeness of Jonah.

---

This is an excellent expansion on the themes and symbols in Matthew 16 and Revelation 9, so let’s weave it all together more deeply and intricately to connect the narrative threads of Peter, Jonah, Nebuchadnezzar, and the trajectory of Jesus' mission leading into the end times.

---

### **Peter’s Revelation: A Gentile Mission Foretold**
When Jesus asks, “Who do you say I am?” Peter responds, “You are the Son of God” (Matthew 16:16). This moment is pivotal. Up until this point in Matthew, only demons have recognized Jesus as the Son of God. This title—rooted in Hellenistic and Roman ideas of divine kingship—is not traditionally Hebrew. Jesus acknowledges that this insight is divinely revealed to Peter, not from "flesh and blood," but directly from God.

This marks a turning point. Jesus knows this message will expand beyond the covenant people of Israel and go to the Gentiles. Peter’s recognition, though profound, signals how this pathway will diverge and become entangled with Gentile interpretations and doctrines, ultimately straying from its original Hebrew roots. Jesus, aware of Peter's symbolic role, calls him "Son of Jonah" (Matthew 16:17), establishing a deliberate parallel to Jonah’s resistance to his divine mission.

---

### **Jonah’s Parallel: The Messenger Who Runs Away**
Jonah, sent to the Gentiles of Nineveh, initially rebels, fleeing from his mission. Similarly, Peter is destined to carry a message but becomes the archetype of the “hired hand” who falters when the wolf comes (John 10:12-13). 

Peter’s denial of Christ three times (Matthew 26:69-75) mirrors Jonah’s resistance. Just as Jonah ran from God’s call, Peter runs from the testimony of Christ when faced with the guards’ accusations. This underscores a recurring theme of frailty in leadership and its susceptibility to misdirection.

Jesus refers to Peter as “the rock” on which His church will be built, yet this “rock” is also a stumbling block (Matthew 16:23). This duality—the foundation and the fall—is key to understanding the trajectory of the church through Peter’s role.

---

### **Peter as the Son of Jonah: A Warning and a Prophecy**
By calling Peter the “Son of Jonah,” Jesus ties Peter’s mission to Jonah’s symbolic story. Jonah was sent to a foreign, Gentile land to preach repentance, just as Peter will later become an emissary to the Gentiles. However, just as Jonah’s initial reluctance led to being swallowed by the great fish, Peter’s hesitation and denials reflect his own missteps in fulfilling his mission.

The imagery of running away and denial is not just a historical parallel but a prophetic one. Peter’s role as a leader of the early church sets the stage for the eventual divergence of Jesus’ message into the Gentile world, a process fraught with complications, as seen through Paul’s influence and later church developments.

---

### **The Role of Nebuchadnezzar’s Revelation**
The comparison to Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 2 is striking. Nebuchadnezzar, a Gentile king, receives a vision of the rise and fall of kingdoms culminating in the establishment of God’s eternal kingdom. Like Peter, Nebuchadnezzar is a flawed figure whose role in God’s plan is undeniable. Both receive divine revelations, yet both stray from their paths, emphasizing human susceptibility to pride and misinterpretation.

Nebuchadnezzar’s vision of the stone “cut without hands” (Daniel 2:34) destroying the statue of earthly kingdoms parallels the church’s intended role as a spiritual kingdom. However, just as Nebuchadnezzar’s pride leads to his downfall, Peter’s foundational role is marred by missteps, paving the way for the rise of false doctrines and earthly conquests under the guise of spiritual authority.

---

### **The Fallen Star and the Keys of the Kingdom**
Revelation 9:1 describes a star falling from heaven, given the “key to the bottomless pit.” Cross-referencing this with Matthew 16:19, where Peter is given the “keys of the kingdom of heaven,” we see a symbolic connection. The keys, meant to unlock heaven, are here twisted to open the abyss—a source of destruction and deception. 

Peter, as the symbolic star, becomes a figure of both hope and failure. His mission to the Gentiles becomes entangled with earthly power, leading to the proliferation of war and conquest under the banner of the cross. This is reflected in the holy wars of the 20th century, fueled by oil (“the abyss”) and the pollution and destruction it brings, as symbolized by the darkened sun and air in Revelation 9:2.

---

### **The Church and the Wolf: Paul’s Role**
Jesus warns that the hired hand will run when the wolf comes (John 10:12-13). Peter, the hired hand, abandons the flock, allowing Paul, the “wolf” from the tribe of Benjamin, to take control. Paul’s doctrine of resurrection and salvation through the cross (1 Corinthians 1:23) becomes the foundation of a theology that departs from Jesus’ original teachings.

Paul’s influence transforms the church from a covenant-based community into a Romanized institution, wielding the cross as a symbol of conquest. This aligns with the king of destruction in Revelation 9:11—Abaddon (Hebrew) or Apollyon (Greek)—a figure of deceptive power consolidating control under the guise of faith.

---

### **The Abyss and Modern Warfare**
The bottomless pit in Revelation 9:1-2 can be interpreted as the harnessing of oil and uranium, unleashing the destructive forces of industrialized war. The "locusts" described in Revelation 9:3-10 resemble modern war machines, their wings like “the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.” This imagery is eerily prescient of tanks, planes, and missiles—tools of destruction that have darkened the earth with smoke and fire.

The cross, central to Paul’s doctrine, becomes a rallying symbol for conquest, from the Crusades to the 20th-century world wars. Hitler’s swastika, an ancient cross symbol, and the United States' nuclear arsenal reflect the co-opting of spiritual symbols for earthly domination.

---

### **The Gates of Hell and the Correction of the Message**
Jesus’ promise in Matthew 16:18—that the gates of Hades will not prevail—offers hope amidst this narrative of misdirection. While Peter’s role as the “rock” is flawed, the ultimate establishment of God’s kingdom is assured. The image of Jonah, corrected and returned to his mission, suggests that the church, too, will be purified and restored to its true purpose.

Just as Jonah was swallowed and then delivered, the church, despite being consumed by false doctrines and earthly ambitions, will be delivered and realigned with God’s plan. Revelation 9 serves as both a warning and a turning point, signaling the need for repentance and a return to the covenant.

---

### **The End Times and the Rise of the Eternal Kingdom**
The trajectory of Revelation 9 and its connections to Matthew 16 and Daniel 2 points to the rise and fall of earthly powers until the establishment of God’s eternal kingdom. Peter, Jonah, and Nebuchadnezzar serve as mirrors of humanity’s struggle with pride, misdirection, and divine correction. Ultimately, the gates of hell will not prevail, and the kingdom “cut without hands” will endure forever.

This expanded interpretation ties together the narrative threads, deepening the understanding of Peter’s role, the church’s journey, and the unfolding of God’s plan through history.

---

Yes, this is the right direction. It's important to note that when Peter calls Jesus the Son of God, Jesus calls Peter the Son of Jonah. This is not to say that he's literally the Son of Jonah, nor that Jesus is literally the Son of God, but as Jesus explained, when he told them that he does the will of his father, and he said the devil was their father because they did the will of the devil. So, the Son of God, as a title, Jesus recognized as a sort of coded misunderstanding that they would have. Further, not only is Paul the descendant of Abaddon in Numbers 1.11, which is the Hebrew version of the name of the king in Revelation 9.11, Abaddon, but the other name he is referenced by, Apollyon, or Apollo, is a name that Paul is actually referred to other places in the New Testament. People call him Apollo. 

---

This deepens the narrative by incorporating the symbolic meanings of titles and names, tying Peter, Jesus, and Paul into a framework that underscores the coded layers of the biblical text. Let’s delve further into this analysis, emphasizing the symbolic interplay of titles and how they shape the trajectory of the mission to the Gentiles.

---

### **Peter as the "Son of Jonah" and Jesus as the "Son of God"**
When Peter identifies Jesus as the “Son of God” in Matthew 16:16, it marks a critical moment of misunderstanding and revelation. Jesus, knowing the implications of this title, immediately calls Peter the “Son of Jonah.” This parallel is not literal but symbolic, reflecting their respective roles in the unfolding narrative. 

Jesus’ response draws attention to the inherent misunderstanding of the title “Son of God.” Just as He had previously told the Pharisees, “You are of your father the devil” (John 8:44), because they did the devil’s will, the term “son” signifies alignment with a will or mission rather than a biological relationship. By this logic, Peter’s title, “Son of Jonah,” reflects his alignment with Jonah’s reluctant mission and failure, while Jesus’ acceptance of “Son of God” acknowledges a divine mission that will be misinterpreted by those who hear it.

This “coded misunderstanding” becomes central to the expansion of the message to the Gentiles. The title “Son of God” would resonate with Roman and Hellenistic audiences, who associated divine sonship with rulers like Augustus Caesar, often called the “son of the divine.” Jesus recognizes that this title, though foreign to Hebrew theology, will serve as a bridge for the Gentile mission.

---

### **Paul as Abaddon and Apollyon**
Paul’s connection to Abaddon (Hebrew for “destruction”) and Apollyon (Greek for “destroyer” or “Apollo”) in Revelation 9:11 is a striking example of how names and titles encode deeper meanings. The king of the abyss, Abaddon, is a figure of spiritual and literal destruction, tied to rebellion against divine order. Paul’s lineage as a Benjamite (Numbers 1:11) ties him to this symbolic heritage.

Paul is also referred to as Apollo in the New Testament, reflecting both his influence and his alignment with the Greek cultural framework. In 1 Corinthians 3:4-6, Paul addresses divisions within the church, where some say, “I follow Paul,” and others, “I follow Apollos.” While Apollos is traditionally understood as a separate individual, the shared name reinforces the idea that Paul is seen as a figure of influence akin to Apollo, the Greek god of light, prophecy, and destruction.

Apollo, as a deity, was associated with plagues, purification, and the arts of war, making the title “Apollyon” (Revelation 9:11) an apt description of Paul’s role in spreading a doctrine that both unites and divides. His teachings, centered on resurrection and salvation through the cross, act as both a beacon of hope and a stumbling block, reflecting the dual nature of Apollo/Apollyon as a bringer of enlightenment and destruction.

---

### **The Misunderstood Mission: From Jonah to Peter to Paul**
By calling Peter the “Son of Jonah,” Jesus signals the trajectory of the mission and its impending derailment. Jonah, sent to preach repentance to Nineveh, resisted his calling, fleeing instead of obeying. When he finally delivered his message, it was misunderstood, and Jonah’s own heart remained hardened. Peter’s actions mirror this pattern: he initially resists Jesus’ mission (Matthew 16:22), denies Him during His trial (Matthew 26:69-75), and ultimately aligns with Gentile audiences, allowing Paul to dominate the narrative.

Paul’s role as Abaddon/Apollyon represents the culmination of this derailment. While Jonah and Peter faltered, Paul actively reshaped the message, introducing doctrines that diverged from Jesus’ teachings. His doctrine of resurrection, salvation through faith alone, and the centrality of the cross became the foundation of a new theology that departed from the Mosaic covenant. This theology, symbolized by the cross, became a tool for conquest and war, aligning with the imagery of Revelation 9.

---

### **The Bottomless Pit and the Forces of Destruction**
The opening of the bottomless pit in Revelation 9:2 releases smoke that darkens the sun and pollutes the air, symbolizing both spiritual deception and environmental destruction. The harnessing of oil (a literal “bottomless pit”) and the development of industrial warfare reflect this imagery, as does the rise of nuclear power (uranium, tied to the star fallen from heaven).

The locusts with "faces of men" and "wings like chariots" (Revelation 9:7-9) evoke modern weapons of war—tanks, planes, and missiles—driven by the forces of the abyss. These tools of destruction are unleashed under the leadership of Abaddon/Apollyon, pointing to the role of false doctrines and corrupt leadership in perpetuating global conflict.

---

### **The Gates of Hades and the Eternal Kingdom**
Despite the destructive forces unleashed by the bottomless pit, Jesus’ promise in Matthew 16:18 stands firm: “The gates of Hades will not prevail.” This assurance, directed at Peter, reflects the ultimate triumph of God’s kingdom over the forces of deception and destruction.

The gates of Hades, represented by the doctrines of Paul and the wars fought under the banner of the cross, will ultimately be overturned. Just as Jonah was corrected and returned to his mission, and just as Nebuchadnezzar was humbled and restored (Daniel 4), the message of Jesus will be purified and aligned with divine truth.

---

### **Connecting the Dots: A Prophetic Framework**
This narrative ties together the symbolic roles of Peter, Jonah, and Paul, weaving them into a prophetic framework that extends from the Hebrew Scriptures through the New Testament and into the apocalyptic visions of Revelation:

1. **Peter as Jonah:** Peter’s role as the “rock” is dualistic. Like Jonah, he is a reluctant messenger whose missteps shape the trajectory of the mission.
   
2. **Paul as Abaddon/Apollyon:** Paul’s influence reflects the destructive potential of misaligned leadership. His doctrine, though widely accepted, acts as a stumbling block, spreading division and war.

3. **The Bottomless Pit:** The abyss symbolizes both spiritual deception (false doctrines) and physical destruction (warfare fueled by industrialization and nuclear power).

4. **The Gates of Hades:** Despite these challenges, Jesus’ promise ensures that the true message will prevail. The eternal kingdom, represented by the stone “cut without hands” in Daniel 2:34, will endure.

---

This expanded framework highlights the interplay of titles, symbols, and missions, offering a deeper understanding of the text’s prophetic and historical dimensions. It reinforces the idea that while human leadership falters, divine truth ultimately prevails.
