List the Hebrew months and when they occur

---



---

The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning its months are based on the moon but adjusted to align with the solar year. Here is a list of the Hebrew months along with their corresponding times in the Gregorian calendar:

1. **Nisan** (1st month) – March/April
2. **Iyar** (2nd month) – April/May
3. **Sivan** (3rd month) – May/June
4. **Tammuz** (4th month) – June/July
5. **Av** (5th month) – July/August
6. **Elul** (6th month) – August/September
7. **Tishrei** (7th month) – September/October
8. **Cheshvan** (8th month) – October/November
9. **Kislev** (9th month) – November/December
10. **Tevet** (10th month) – December/January
11. **Shevat** (11th month) – January/February
12. **Adar** (12th month) – February/March

In leap years, an additional month called **Adar II** is inserted between Shevat and Nisan, extending the calendar year. The regular Adar in leap years is referred to as **Adar I**.

So when do we know the first day

---

The first day of the Hebrew calendar, marking the beginning of the month of Nisan, is determined by the appearance of the new moon. Traditionally, the Hebrew calendar was based on direct observation of the lunar cycle, with the new month beginning when witnesses reported seeing the first sliver of the new moon to the Sanhedrin, which would then declare the new month.

In the modern Hebrew calendar, which has been fixed since the 4th century, the months are pre-calculated using mathematical rules. The first day of Nisan generally falls in March or April, though the exact date shifts each year depending on the lunar cycle and how the calendar aligns with the solar year. Nisan is also important because it marks the beginning of the religious calendar and is linked to Passover.

To determine the first day of the year today, you would look at the occurrence of the new moon closest to the spring equinox. The first day of Nisan falls on the new moon that begins the month, and the Hebrew calendar adjusts for leap years to keep the festivals aligned with the seasons.

I mean, how do I know when the new month begins? Is it the new moon

---

Yes, the Hebrew months traditionally begin with the **new moon**. In ancient times, the new month (Rosh Chodesh) was declared when two reliable witnesses observed the first sliver of the new moon. This sighting would be reported to the Sanhedrin (Jewish court), who would then officially declare the start of the new month.

In the fixed Hebrew calendar used today, the months are still based on the lunar cycle, with the new moon marking the beginning of each month. Here's how it works:

1. **New Moon:** The new month starts with the appearance of the new moon, which is the first visible crescent after the dark phase (astronomical new moon).
2. **Rosh Chodesh:** The first day of the new month is called "Rosh Chodesh," meaning "head of the month."

In summary, each Hebrew month begins with the new moon. While in ancient times this was based on visual observation, the current calendar is pre-calculated using astronomical cycles. You can track the phases of the moon to know when the next month will begin.

So rush hashana should technically be when 

---

Technically, **Rosh Hashanah** (the Jewish New Year) should begin on the first day of the month of **Tishrei**, which is the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar, based on the appearance of the new moon. However, the date of **Rosh Hashanah** is pre-calculated in the fixed Hebrew calendar.

In terms of the lunar cycle, Rosh Hashanah begins at sunset following the sighting of the **new moon** that marks the start of Tishrei, generally occurring in **September or early October** in the Gregorian calendar. While the new moon signals the start of the month, the current Jewish calendar uses a set calculation, so the exact date of Rosh Hashanah is known in advance.

Even though the Hebrew calendar begins its religious year with **Nisan** (in the spring), the **civil** new year starts in Tishrei, with Rosh Hashanah traditionally viewed as the anniversary of the creation of the world.
