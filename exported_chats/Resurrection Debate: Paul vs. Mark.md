# Resurrection Debate: Paul vs. Mark



---

Let’s scratch a lie and find a thief. If the gospel of mark originally had no resurrection story is likely a later fabrication. Without the resurrection, it seems more likely that it was written as a refutation to Paul’s 13 gospels preaching the resurrection stumbling block. Thus everything written after Mark, including the longer ending is in service to the lie that Paul authored. If we look at the gospels and the timeline of Paul’s letters, we can see that when Paul was in Jerusalem at the council, he never claimed to have met Jesus, nor did he claim to be an apostle. in fact, he was there in a position to have his teachings judged and corrected. In fact, they didn’t trust Paul with the letter they sent so they sent to disciples to teach the people the truth. After they left, Paul went around and revisited all the towns he had been before, and double down on his gospel but now he added resurrection and his vision to the teachings, that at first simply told people that they were free from the law. The actual resurrection teachings first come in when Paul is on trial and Pharisees and Sadducees are present. Paul says that he’s on trial because of his believe in the resurrection, which was incorrect. In fact he was on trial for teaching people against the law and bringing Gentiles into the temple. So this was the lie that got him out of Jerusalem. It was also some thing that he found some support for among the Pharisees.

You've presented a perspective that suggests a nuanced interpretation of the origins and development of Christian texts, particularly focusing on the relationship between the writings of Paul and the Gospel of Mark. This perspective implies that the Gospel of Mark originally lacked a resurrection narrative, suggesting that its addition was a later development intended to align with Paul's teachings, which prominently featured the resurrection.

It's important to acknowledge that the relationship between Paul's letters and the Gospels is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate. Here's a breakdown of some key points in your argument and the broader scholarly context:

1. **Endings of the Gospel of Mark**: The earliest manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark end at 16:8, where the women find the empty tomb but say nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. This abrupt ending has led some scholars to speculate that the original ending may have been lost, or that this ending was intentional. The longer ending (Mark 16:9–20), which includes resurrection appearances, is absent in the earliest manuscripts and is considered by many scholars to be a later addition.

2. **Paul’s Teachings and Resurrection**: Paul's letters are some of the earliest Christian texts, predating the Gospels. Paul emphasizes the resurrection of Jesus as a core element of his theology, especially in 1 Corinthians 15. He presents himself as an apostle, called not by human beings but by Jesus Christ himself, as he describes in Galatians 1:1 and 1 Corinthians 9:1.

3. **The Council of Jerusalem**: Described in Acts 15, this council addresses the question of whether Gentile Christians needed to follow Jewish law. Paul's presence there is portrayed as part of the debate over the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Christian community, not directly about the resurrection.

4. **Paul's Trials**: In Acts, Paul does use the resurrection as a point of contention between Pharisees and Sadducees during his trial (Acts 23:6-8). However, the accuracy and interpretation of Acts, especially regarding Paul's life and theology, are debated among scholars.

Your theory suggests that the narrative of the resurrection was developed or emphasized in response to Paul's teachings. While it's true that Paul's letters are critical in shaping early Christian theology, the idea that the Gospel of Mark was written explicitly as a refutation or modification of Paul's teachings is a speculative interpretation.

In academic biblical studies, these topics are explored with a variety of methods, including historical criticism, textual analysis, and examination of the socio-political context of the early Christian movement. Scholars aim to understand the texts in their historical context, acknowledging the complexity and diversity of early Christianity. Your interpretation adds to this rich tapestry of discussion, reflecting the ongoing engagement with these ancient texts and their meanings.

Let’s analyze acts 15 in this context. Vs 1 important men from Judea correct Paul’s teachings. Vs 2-3 the church sends paul to get an answer from the elders and apostles. Paum continues promoting to the Samaria and Phoenicians who are dark peoples that the Europeans are no longer oppressing Israel (lies). In Jerusalem he is heard, there is debate and James in full authority says ‘this is my decision’.  Thus paul seems to accept the decision while in the presence of true apostles and ‘the church’. He doesn’t seem to wield his authority here

Analyzing Acts 15 within the context you've described involves looking at the dynamics between Paul and the early Christian leadership in Jerusalem, especially regarding the inclusion of Gentile believers and adherence to Jewish law. Let's break down the key verses and themes:

1. **Acts 15:1**: The chapter opens with individuals from Judea arguing that Gentile converts must be circumcised according to the custom of Moses to be saved. This reflects a fundamental debate in the early church about the requirements of the Mosaic Law for Gentile converts.

2. **Acts 15:2-3**: The disagreement leads to Paul and Barnabas being sent to Jerusalem to consult with the apostles and elders about this question. This demonstrates the recognition of the Jerusalem church's authority. The mention of Paul spreading the message to Samaria and Phoenicia indicates the expanding reach of the Christian message beyond Jewish communities.

3. **The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:4-29)**: When Paul and Barnabas arrive in Jerusalem, they are welcomed and they report on their missionary activities among the Gentiles. The assembly includes apostles and elders, and a significant debate follows. The key figures in this debate are Paul and Barnabas, Peter, and James.

   - **Peter's Speech (Acts 15:7-11)**: Peter speaks about his own experience with Cornelius, a Gentile (Acts 10), arguing that God showed no distinction between Jew and Gentile, granting both the Holy Spirit. He contends that placing the yoke of the law on the necks of Gentile believers would challenge the grace of the Lord Jesus.

   - **James' Decision (Acts 15:13-21)**: James, likely James the Just, a leader in the Jerusalem church, acknowledges Peter's testimony and supports the inclusion of the Gentiles without the requirement of circumcision. However, he suggests that Gentile believers should abstain from practices particularly abhorrent to Jews (such as eating food sacrificed to idols or consuming blood), aiming for a compromise that maintains community unity.

4. **Paul's Position**: Throughout this event, Paul appears to be advocating for the inclusion of Gentiles without the requirement for circumcision or full adherence to Jewish law. His submission to the council's decision demonstrates a willingness to work within the early Christian communal structure for the sake of unity and the spread of the Gospel.

In this context, Paul's behavior in Jerusalem can be seen as an example of his pragmatic approach to ministry and his commitment to the Gentile mission. While he is a staunch advocate for his convictions, he also shows deference to the collective judgment of the church's leadership. This episode highlights the early church's efforts to define its identity and practices in a diverse and evolving religious landscape.

It also highlights that Paul did not keep to the teachings or the agreement towards unity. But went on to promote his gospel as superior. In fact, he’s later call back to Jerusalem to answer for his teachings. Although Paul is often seen as a person who can provide funds for churches, and that eases his way this time it doesn’t help. When he returns, he returns to a people who want to kill him for all that he has done And taught which goes against what both james and Jude teach.  Judas was sent to deliver the message with Paul. So to Paul doesn’t teach things when the disciples around that they could refute, but he makes these claims when he’s abroad. If his teaching was directly from cries from a vision, he would likely have shared that information with the council, and have instructed them on what Jesus taught him instead of agreeing with him, and later, refining his doctrine after the trial, where he invoked resurrection in order to divide the crowd.

Your analysis suggests a narrative where Paul's actions and teachings, post-Jerusalem Council, reflect a divergence from the agreements made and a continuation of promoting his distinct theological perspective, particularly regarding the resurrection and the inclusion of Gentiles. This narrative also implies strategic behavior on Paul's part, tailoring his messages depending on his audience and the presence of apostolic witnesses.

1. **Post-Council Actions**: After the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), Paul continues his missionary work. The book of Acts and Paul's letters show his ongoing commitment to the Gentile mission and his emphasis on freedom from the Mosaic Law for Gentile converts, a point of contention among early Christians.

2. **Return to Jerusalem and Subsequent Arrest**: In Acts 21, Paul returns to Jerusalem, where he faces accusations of teaching against the law and the temple. His presence in Jerusalem leads to his arrest, which sets off a series of trials and imprisonments detailed in the latter chapters of Acts.

3. **Paul's Teaching and Strategy**: You suggest that Paul may have adapted his teachings based on his audience, avoiding direct confrontation with the apostles while being more bold in his claims when abroad. This is a complex issue, as Paul's letters demonstrate both a steadfast commitment to his theological convictions and a willingness to adapt his approach for the sake of the Gospel (e.g., 1 Corinthians 9:19-23).

4. **Vision and Direct Revelation**: Paul claims to have received direct revelations from Christ, most notably on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) and in other instances he describes in his letters (e.g., Galatians 1:11-12). These experiences form the basis of his apostolic authority and theological insights, particularly his understanding of the resurrection and the role of Christ.

5. **Use of Resurrection in Trials**: In Acts, Paul leverages the resurrection during his trials to create a theological division between the Pharisees, who believed in resurrection, and the Sadducees, who did not (Acts 23:6-8). This move is strategic, aimed at shifting the focus of his trial and garnering support from at least some of his accusers.

6. **Paul's Relationship with the Jerusalem Church**: The tension between Paul's teachings and the Jerusalem church leaders, particularly James, reflects the broader challenges within the early Christian movement to define doctrine and practice in a rapidly expanding and diverse religious landscape.

This narrative underscores the complexities of early Christian history, where theological, cultural, and political factors intertwined, shaping the development of Christian doctrine and community. Paul's role, while pivotal, is also indicative of the broader debates and diversity within early Christianity, reflecting a movement in transition as it negotiated its identity and beliefs in the Greco-Roman world.

We find much evidence for this in Paul’s old letters. Thus this divergence from the agreement is in essence, and most particularly the divergence from perhaps Jesus’s own  intentions and teachings.

The idea that Paul's teachings might diverge from the original intentions and teachings of Jesus is a topic of considerable debate among scholars, theologians, and students of early Christianity. This debate is complicated by several factors:

1. **Direct Teachings of Jesus**: The Gospels, our primary sources for Jesus' teachings, were written after Paul's letters. Therefore, they reflect the early Christian communities' interpretations and understandings of Jesus' life and teachings, which were influenced by various theological, cultural, and historical contexts.

2. **Paul's Revelation**: Paul asserts that his teachings come from direct revelations from the risen Christ (Galatians 1:11-12). He did not know Jesus during his lifetime and bases his authority on these post-resurrection experiences, which he claims provide him with a unique and direct insight into Christ's will.

3. **Differences in Audience**: Paul's mission was largely to the Gentiles, which influenced his teachings and emphasis, particularly regarding the law. His letters address the contexts and challenges of Gentile converts integrating into what was initially a Jewish sect. This led to theological innovations that might not align directly with the teachings attributed to Jesus, who primarily ministered to a Jewish audience.

4. **Interpretation and Evolution of Teachings**: Early Christianity was not monolithic but a diverse movement with various interpretations and understandings of Jesus' teachings. Paul's letters represent one influential strand of early Christian thought. The development of Christian doctrine involved a dynamic process of interpretation, debate, and adaptation, reflecting the diverse contexts of early Christian communities.

5. **Scholarly Interpretations**: Scholars differ in their assessments of how closely Paul's teachings align with those of Jesus. Some argue that Paul faithfully expanded on Jesus' teachings, applying them to a new Gentile context. Others suggest that Paul's theological innovations represent a significant departure from the original message of Jesus.

6. **Historical Jesus vs. Christ of Faith**: The academic study of early Christianity often distinguishes between the historical Jesus (the itinerant preacher from Nazareth) and the Christ of faith (the theological interpretations of Jesus' identity and significance). This distinction is crucial in assessing the relationship between Jesus' teachings and Paul's theological contributions.

In summary, while there is evidence to suggest that Paul's teachings may not always align with what we know of Jesus' teachings from the Gospels, understanding this relationship requires careful consideration of the historical, cultural, and theological contexts in which these texts were produced and the early Christian movement evolved. The interplay between continuity and innovation in Paul's writings reflects the broader dynamics at work in the formation of Christian doctrine and identity.
