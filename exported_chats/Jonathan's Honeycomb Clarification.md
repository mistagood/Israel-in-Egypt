# Jonathan's Honeycomb Clarification



---



---

Did Jonathan dip the tip of his sword in the honey to taste it?

---



---

No, Jonathan did **not dip the tip of his sword** in the honey. He dipped **the end of his staff (rod)** into the honeycomb.

Here is the **exact verse**:

---

**1 Samuel 14:27 (KJV)**  
> “But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore **he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand**, and **dipped it in a honeycomb**, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.”

---

### Key details:
- **Object used**: “the end of the rod that was in his hand” (Hebrew: *קצה המטה* – *qatzeh ha-matteh* = "the tip of the staff").
- **Action**: dipped it in the honeycomb (*בִּיַּעֲרַת הַדְּבַשׁ* – *biyya'arat ha-devash*, lit. “in the forest of honey” or “honeycomb”), then put his hand to his mouth.
- **Result**: "his eyes were enlightened" — a Hebrew idiom for being revived or regaining strength/clarity (see also Psalm 13:3 and Ezra 9:8).

So:  
❌ **Not a sword**  
✅ **A staff or rod**

Let me know if you'd like the Hebrew breakdown or a comparison to the symbolic meaning (e.g. eyes enlightened = understanding restored).
