# Abraham's settlement journey

So, let's retrace Abraham's journey. When he left for Calcudes, he was called out. He went around, did some stuff, ended up building an altar, settling somewhere. Then he ended up somewhere after a lot. I want to know ultimately where he ended up staying after Sodom and Gomorrah. So, I think the last time we see about Abraham is around that time. And he dies probably in that same place. Let's just get a rundown on that.

Here’s the straight-line rundown of Abraham’s movements, tracking only the **textual record** and focusing on **where he ultimately settles after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah**. No embellishment—just the narrative trail as it appears in Genesis.

---

## **1. Ur → Haran (the calling and departure)**  
Abraham is called while still among his kin. Genesis 11:31–12:5 shows the movement from **Ur of the Chaldees** to **Haran**. The call of Genesis 12:1 occurs in this period, and Abraham leaves Haran at age 75.

---

## **2. Haran → Canaan → Shechem (first arrival in the land)**  
Genesis 12:5–7  
Abraham enters Canaan, goes straight to **Shechem**, the “oak of Moreh,” and builds an altar there. This is the first altar in the land.

---

## **3. Shechem → Bethel → Egypt → Bethel (famine, exile, return)**  
Genesis 12:8 → Genesis 12:10 → Genesis 13  
He moves south, builds a second altar between **Bethel and Ai**, goes to **Egypt**, then returns to the **same altar at Bethel**.

---

## **4. Bethel → Hebron (after the Lot separation)**  
Genesis 13:14–18  
After Lot separates from him, God reiterates the land promise. Abraham then moves to **Hebron**, specifically the **oaks of Mamre**, and builds another altar.  
This becomes his primary residence for years.

---

## **5. Hebron → outskirts of Sodom (to rescue Lot) → back to Hebron**  
Genesis 14  
He mobilizes men from Hebron, rescues Lot, meets Melchizedek, then returns to Hebron.

---

## **6. Theophany and covenant at Hebron**  
Genesis 15  
Still in **Hebron**, God establishes the covenant “between the pieces.”

---

## **7. Hagar, Ishmael, the Covenant of Circumcision**  
Genesis 16–17  
These events all occur while Abraham is still in **Hebron**.

---

## **8. Sodom & Gomorrah destroyed — Abraham relocates afterward**  
This is the shift point you’re looking for.

### **Where was Abraham living during the Sodom events?**  
Genesis 18:1 – “The LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre” (Hebron).  
He watches the destruction from the elevated region near Hebron (Genesis 19:27).

### **Where did Abraham move after Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed?**  
Genesis 20:1 answers this directly.

> “Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the **Negev**, and dwelled between **Kadesh and Shur**, and **sojourned in Gerar**.”

This is the **Philistine coastal basin**, southwest of Canaan, in the region later associated with **Gaza–Gerar**.

---

## **9. Post-Sodom final settlement: Beersheba**  
After the Gerar incident with Abimelech, Abraham establishes **his long-term residence**.

Genesis 21:33:

> “Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in **Beersheba**, and called there on the name of the LORD.”

Beersheba becomes the **final stable residence** of Abraham’s later life.

### **Evidence he lived there permanently**  
Genesis 22:19 (after the Akedah):

> “So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to **Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba**.”

This is the last narrative location explicitly tied to Abraham during his life.

---

## **10. Where does Abraham die?**
Genesis 25:7–10  
He is **buried in Machpelah**, by **Mamre (Hebron)**—  
**but the text does NOT say he was living in Hebron when he died.**

The only stated residence after Sodom is:

- Gerar  
- **Beersheba (long-term)**

So the burial in Hebron is about the ancestral tomb, not his residence at death.

---

# **Summary: Abraham’s Final Movements After Sodom**

**1. Hebron** — watching Sodom burn.  
**2. Moves south to Gerar** (Genesis 20).  
**3. Establishes permanent residence in **Beersheba** (Genesis 21:33; 22:19).  
**4. Dies and is buried in Hebron**, but not living there.

So Abraham’s **final home in life was Beersheba**, not Hebron.

If you want, we can insert a short factual section into your Shechem document summarizing Abraham’s stops and explaining why Shechem becomes the anchor point even though Abraham’s later residence shifts south.
