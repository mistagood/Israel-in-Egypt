# Ephraim Illustration Request



---

I need an illustration style image generated that can go on the back of my booklets and pamphlets here. This is a son of Ephraim, one of the tribe members. This is a representation he has in his hand. And the staff of Judah and his companions, and Joseph and his companions. You can see that the staff has been grafted to join the two together. So the two houses have been grafted into one, and they are in the hand of Ephraim. Ephraim is really a composite of me, my sons. My hair is wooly and kind of long in the back, standing at the top. And so I need an illustration of the man of Ephraim as a representation, holding the staff and looking kind of pleasantly as he is.

  "prompt": "An illustrated image of a strong, peaceful-looking man representing the son of Ephraim from the Bible. He has woolly, medium-long hair that is full and extends toward the back, standing at the crown. He wears a simple, ancient-style garment with fringes hanging from the borders, representing a Hebrew identity. In his hand, he holds a tall staff made of two joined rods — one labeled 'Judah' and the other 'Joseph.' The staff is clearly grafted in the middle, symbolizing the reunion of the two houses of Israel. The man stands confidently, holding the united staff upright in front of him, with a subtle smile of assurance and wisdom. The illustration is drawn in a clean, stylized, semi-realistic black-ink line art style suitable for the back of religious pamphlets and booklets.",

Nice.  Whiteish hair should be thicker. My hair is laid down and wavy on the top and sides, but the back becomes more like an afro. Just as his kinda does, just a little thicker, woolier, like in the Bible. And the skin should be more bronze-colored if that makes sense in a black and white. Otherwise, it's perfect.

{
  "prompt": "A black and white ink drawing of a bearded man of ancient Israelite origin, representing the son of Ephraim. He has a calm yet resolute expression, with his hair laid down and wavy on top and sides, transitioning into a thicker, woolly afro-like texture at the back. His skin tone should appear bronze in style despite the monochrome format, shown through richer shading. He wears a traditional tunic with tassels. He holds a staff in his hand labeled 'Joseph' and 'Judah', where the two staffs have been grafted together into one. The man stands proudly in profile, representing the unification of the two houses in the hand of Ephraim.",

The hair and beard mustache should be like mine. My hairs pulled back now but imagine a bit at the back in the pattern I drew.  Otherwise perfect.

Okay, I need the fullness and the texture of the beard back with the thinness of the mustache and I really need to be able to see the words Judah and Joseph on the stick but its hands are covering part of Joseph right now so I want to be able to clearly see Judah and Joseph.
