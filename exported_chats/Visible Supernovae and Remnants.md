list of the supernovas visible with the human eye their dates and remnants

Supernovae are stellar explosions that can briefly outshine an entire galaxy, radiating as much energy as the Sun is expected to emit over its entire life span. However, only a few supernovae have been bright enough to be visible to the naked eye from Earth. Here's a list of some of the most famous naked-eye supernovae, their dates of observation, and their remnants:

| Supernova | Date of Observation | Remnant |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| SN 185    | AD 185              | RCW 86  |
| SN 1006   | AD 1006             | SN 1006 |
| SN 1054   | AD 1054             | Crab Nebula (M1) |
| SN 1572   | AD 1572             | Tycho's Supernova Remnant |
| SN 1604   | AD 1604             | Kepler's Supernova Remnant |
| SN 1987A  | 1987                | SN 1987A |

Note:
1. **SN 185** was recorded by Chinese astronomers and is possibly the earliest recorded supernova.
2. **SN 1006** was the brightest recorded supernova and was documented by observers across the world, including China, Japan, the Middle East, and Europe.
3. **SN 1054** led to the formation of the Crab Nebula, which is one of the most studied astronomical objects in the sky.
4. **SN 1572**, also known as Tycho's Supernova, was observed by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe.
5. **SN 1604**, also known as Kepler's Supernova, was observed by Johannes Kepler.
6. **SN 1987A** was the closest observed supernova since the invention of the telescope and occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

You're right; there have been other supernovae visible to the naked eye throughout history. Here's an expanded list:

| Supernova | Date of Observation | Remnant |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| SN 185    | AD 185              | RCW 86  |
| SN 393    | AD 393              | G347.3-0.5 (possible remnant) |
| SN 1006   | AD 1006             | SN 1006 |
| SN 1054   | AD 1054             | Crab Nebula (M1) |
| SN 1181   | AD 1181             | 3C 58   |
| SN 1572   | AD 1572             | Tycho's Supernova Remnant |
| SN 1604   | AD 1604             | Kepler's Supernova Remnant |
| SN 1987A  | 1987                | SN 1987A |
| SN 1993J  | 1993                | SN 1993J (in M81) |

Notes:
1. **SN 393** was recorded by Chinese astronomers, and its remnant is possibly G347.3-0.5, though this is not confirmed.
2. **SN 1181** was observed in the constellation Cassiopeia and its remnant, 3C 58, is a pulsar wind nebula.
3. **SN 1993J** was not visible to the naked eye from most locations on Earth, but it was one of the brightest supernovae of the 20th century and was visible without a telescope from very dark locations.

This list is not exhaustive, and there might be other supernovae that were visible to the naked eye but were not recorded or their records have been lost. Would you like this information in a specific file format or any other details?

sn2018

SN 2018cow, often referred to as "The Cow," was a supernova discovered in 2018. It was an unusual and extremely bright event that attracted significant attention from astronomers worldwide. Here are some details:

| Supernova | Date of Discovery | Host Galaxy | Type | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------|-------|
| SN 2018cow| June 16, 2018     | CGCG 137-068| Uncertain, possibly a type Ic or a new type | It was an atypical supernova due to its rapid brightening and high luminosity. The event was 10 to 100 times brighter than a typical supernova. |

The exact nature and cause of SN 2018cow are still subjects of research and debate. Some theories suggest it could be the result of a white dwarf being pulled apart by a black hole, while others believe it could be a massive star undergoing a core-collapse supernova. The event's rapid brightening and the unusual spectral features it exhibited make it a unique and intriguing object in the study of supernovae.

Certainly! SN 2018cow, colloquially known as "The Cow," was a unique and intriguing astronomical event. Here are more detailed insights:

### SN 2018cow (The Cow)

- **Discovery Date:** June 16, 2018
- **Location:** In the galaxy CGCG 137-068, approximately 200 million light-years away in the constellation Hercules.
- **Type:** The exact classification is uncertain. Initially, it was thought to be a Type Ic supernova, but its unusual characteristics have led some to believe it might represent a new category of explosive events.
- **Brightness:** SN 2018cow reached its peak brightness in just a few days, which is significantly faster than typical supernovae that can take weeks. At its peak, it was 10 to 100 times brighter than a standard supernova.
- **Spectral Features:** The event exhibited unusual spectral features, with broad lines indicating material was ejected at a high fraction of the speed of light.
- **Possible Explanations:**
  1. **Black Hole Formation:** One theory is that SN 2018cow represents the birth of a black hole or a neutron star. The rapid brightening could be due to the creation of a high-speed jet of material, similar to those seen in gamma-ray bursts.
  2. **White Dwarf Tidal Disruption:** Another possibility is that a white dwarf star came too close to a black hole and was torn apart, leading to the observed explosion.
  3. **Core-Collapse Supernova:** Some researchers believe that SN 2018cow could be a massive star undergoing a core-collapse supernova, but with properties that differ from known supernova types.
- **Significance:** Due to its unusual characteristics, SN 2018cow provides a unique opportunity for astronomers to study the physics of explosive stellar events and the environments in which they occur. The event was observed across multiple wavelengths (from radio to X-rays), providing a comprehensive view of its evolution.

The exact nature of SN 2018cow remains a topic of ongoing research, and new observations and studies will likely provide more clarity in the future.

I assume you're referring to the timeline of events related to SN 2018cow. Let's align the days post-discovery to provide a clearer picture of its evolution:

### Timeline of SN 2018cow (The Cow)

- **Day 0 (June 16, 2018):** Discovery of SN 2018cow in the galaxy CGCG 137-068.
  
- **Day 2-3:** Rapid increase in brightness. SN 2018cow reached its peak luminosity much faster than typical supernovae.
  
- **Day 3-7:** Observations across multiple wavelengths began, revealing unusual spectral features. Broad lines in the spectrum indicated material ejected at a significant fraction of the speed of light.
  
- **Day 7-14:** Continued monitoring of the event. The supernova's brightness began to decline, but it remained significantly brighter than typical supernovae at this stage.
  
- **Weeks to Months Post-Discovery:** The event was studied in detail across various wavelengths, from radio to X-rays. The data collected provided insights into the possible nature and cause of the explosion.

- **Ongoing:** The exact classification and cause of SN 2018cow remain subjects of research. Theories include black hole formation, white dwarf tidal disruption, and a unique type of core-collapse supernova.

This timeline provides a general overview of the event's progression. Specific details and observations might vary based on the source and the instrument used for observation.
