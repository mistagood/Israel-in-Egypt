# Rebecca's Relation to Abraham

How was Rebecca related to Sarah or Abraham in the Bible?

Rebecca, in the Bible, was related to both Abraham and Sarah through family lineage. She was the granddaughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother, making her Abraham's grandniece. Specifically, Rebecca was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Nahor and Milcah. This family connection means that Rebecca was Sarah's niece by marriage, as Sarah was Abraham's wife. 

Thus, when Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah, married Rebecca, he was marrying a relative, which was a common practice in maintaining family lines in biblical times.

Yes, but Sarah was also Abraham's sister. So was she Nahor's sister?

Yes, you're correct that Sarah was referred to as Abraham's sister in the Bible. However, it's important to clarify the nature of their relationship.

In **Genesis 20:12**, Abraham explains that Sarah is his half-sister: "Indeed she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife." This suggests that Sarah and Abraham shared the same father, **Terah**, but had different mothers. 

This means that Sarah was not Nahor's sister. **Nahor** and **Abraham** were full brothers, both being the sons of **Terah**. Sarah was Abraham's half-sister and, therefore, not directly related to Nahor through their mother.

In summary:
- **Abraham and Nahor** were full brothers (both sons of Terah).
- **Sarah** was Abraham's half-sister (sharing the same father, Terah, but not the same mother).
- **Nahor** and **Sarah** were not full siblings; Sarah was only related to Nahor through their father, Terah.

Okay so they were half siblings Terah.  That was the question. Thanks

You're welcome! Yes, they were half-siblings through their father, Terah. Glad I could clarify that for you! Let me know if you have any more questions.
