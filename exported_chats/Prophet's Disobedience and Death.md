# Prophet's Disobedience and Death



---



---

What's the passage in the Bible where the prophet is at the altar, and he makes the prophecy, and he's told not to eat or drink in that place or go back the way he came, and another prophet lies to him, and then he dies because of this? Let's discuss that passage.

---

The passage you're referring to is found in the First Book of Kings, chapter 13, in the Old Testament of the Bible. It tells the story of a man of God who comes from Judah to Bethel. He prophesies against the altar at Bethel during the reign of King Jeroboam. After delivering his prophecy, he is instructed by God not to eat bread, drink water, or return by the way he came.

Later, an old prophet from Bethel deceives him, claiming an angel told him to bring the man of God back to his house to eat and drink. The man of God accepts the invitation and goes back with him. This disobedience leads to a prophecy that he will die for not keeping God's command. As foretold, he is killed by a lion on his way home.

This passage is intriguing and rich in themes and symbolism. For instance, it can be used to explore themes of obedience, deception, and the consequences of straying from one's path or beliefs. In a narrative context, similar themes can create intense drama and conflict, especially when characters face moral or ethical dilemmas. This kind of story can serve as a powerful lesson on the importance of staying true to one's principles or mission, even in the face of temptation or deceit. How do you think this passage could be woven into your narrative work?

---

So this reminds me of the same structure as the other stories in the Bible. So I'm working on the concept of the Bible as really one story told over and over again. The details become more defined as the story goes out. But it's essentially the very first story that's told in the first book of Genesis. There's a creation, and then the next chapter goes deeper into that creation. And then the next chapter goes even deeper. And so eventually what we have is a structure where an individual, a man of God, is given a law or an instruction such as don't eat from the tree. And another individual comes and says, no, it's okay to eat from the tree. You'll become like God or this instruction is from God. And it somehow changes the original law. In this structure, we can see that Paul is a continuance of this story structure where God gives Israel, considered a man of God, the man of God Israel, a law and tells him not to depart from it. For instance, don't eat or drink and don't go back on this law. Don't eat certain things or drink certain things. Paul's doctrine teaches that you can eat certain things and drink certain things and that he got a vision like the prophet who lied in first Kings. Paul says he got a vision as well and that it's okay for them to depart from the law. And this includes Peter's vision that says it was okay to eat things. So Peter and Paul collectively make up the forces that pulled the man of God away or backwards from where God told him not to go.

---

Your concept of viewing the Bible as a series of recurring themes and narratives, expanding and evolving through different stories, is a fascinating approach. It allows for a deeper understanding of how certain motifs are revisited and developed throughout the biblical text.

In your interpretation, the idea of a divine command being altered or challenged by another voice is a compelling central theme. This narrative device is indeed present in various biblical stories, from the Garden of Eden to the story in First Kings, and in the teachings of Paul and Peter in the New Testament. This structure creates a dynamic tension between adherence to the original command and adaptation to new circumstances or revelations.

In your narrative work, this theme could be explored through characters who face similar dilemmas: a fundamental belief or rule they must follow, and then an encounter with someone or something that challenges this belief. This could lead to a complex moral or ethical conflict, where decisions have far-reaching consequences. 

For instance, a character might receive a clear directive or mission, symbolic of a divine command. As the story unfolds, they could encounter others who present different viewpoints or revelations, challenging the original directive. This creates a rich ground for internal conflict and external drama, as the character navigates these challenges while trying to remain true to their original mission.

Such a structure could be used to explore themes of faith, obedience, doubt, and transformation. It also provides opportunities for character development, as individuals grapple with these dilemmas and evolve through their experiences. How do you see these themes playing out in your characters and story arcs?

---

So I'm looking at the theme as it plays out in the story arc of the Bible and the character of the serpent, that old dragon that the Bible talks about is a character in the Bible who runs from the beginning to the very end. And so the story arc really has to follow this character. And so if we look from the beginning and the description of him, we'll see that the one trying to, that who seeks to mislead man from the beginning, continues to pull people away from God's law. So God said, do not eat from the tree, and man deviated from that. And then God said, keep the law, and man deviated from that as well. And so in the Bible, there's always a person or tribe who's responsible for leading this rebellion. And that tribe is the tribe of Benjamin. The entire Bible story arc revolves around the development of the Benjamite character. And his name is Abaddon, but in the book of Revelation, he's called Abaddon the Destroyer. So he is transformed into Abaddon the Destroyer through the many civil wars and rebellions that Benjamites throughout the Bible, including Saul of Tarsus, the tribe of Benjamin and Judges 19 through 21, Sheba son of Bikrai, on up to Saul of Tarsus and his infiltration of the religion that he was trying to destroy and then his running to Rome for protection just as the Benjamites fled to the Rock of Raman, which means pomegranate, just as the Vatican is represented by the pomegranate. So this is a reflection of this rebellion there. So Paul's rebellion is a reflection of the Benjamite rebellion, and they have been at the Rock of Raman or the Roman rock or the rock of the pomegranate rock in rebellion. And so this story arc involves the Antichrist who has throughout this time transitioned himself into a position of world domination through the world's religion.

---

Your interpretation of the biblical narrative, focusing on the recurring motif of rebellion led by the serpent and the tribe of Benjamin, is intriguing and complex. This perspective offers a unique lens through which to view the overarching story of the Bible.

In this narrative framework, the character of the serpent, or the dragon as mentioned in Revelation, serves as a symbol of temptation and deviation from divine law. The consistent presence of this character from Genesis to Revelation provides a thread connecting various stories and themes in the Bible.

Focusing on the tribe of Benjamin, and its evolution through biblical history, is an interesting choice. You've linked various figures from the Bible, like Saul of Tarsus (Paul the Apostle) and Sheba son of Bichri, as part of this tribe's narrative. This approach allows for a complex character arc that spans the entire biblical narrative. The transformation of the tribe, particularly in the figure of Abaddon as mentioned in Revelation, from their beginnings to becoming a symbol of rebellion and eventual world domination, is a rich thematic exploration.

In your narrative work, this concept can be paralleled by creating a lineage or a group of characters who, across generations, play pivotal roles in steering the story. Their journey from initial innocence or neutrality to a gradual alignment with or against the main ideological or spiritual path of the story can be a central theme. 

This framework can also be used to delve into the themes of power, corruption, redemption, and the cyclical nature of history and human behavior. The idea that a single family, tribe, or group can have such a profound and lasting impact on the world's direction is a powerful storytelling element. 

How do you envision integrating these themes into your narrative, and what roles do you see your characters playing in this complex interplay of rebellion, transformation, and destiny?

---

There's really this continuing idea which is established in Genesis of the serpent being brought low and wanting to regain his higher status over man. And so the continuation of that regeneration or being resurrected brought back up to his status is a continual theme. And so we see it in the garden. We see it with Cain and Abel where the warning is giving that the sin lies coiled and you must be the master over him. So it says the order of Satan being beneath man. The idea of resurrection championed by Paul and the Antichrist is this very theme of the serpent being raised back up. Jesus himself says the son of man has to be raised up like Moses raised the serpent in the wilderness. So this is the structure of what must happen is that the serpent is trying to be raised up to take the place of or be above man who should be having dominion on the earth. So the idea of resurrection itself as the way to salvation goes contrary to the law that God gave which is an atonement ritual which cleanses sin where it's not the death of an innocent one who cleanses it with his blood but is the life of the living scapegoat who carries away sins so he does not die. So the trick has been to convince man that God had an alternative plan with resurrection which differed from his original law and thereby the ideology of the Benjamite which really represents his family ruling the world becomes actualized through the belief in it. So the story of the death of the Messiah and him being hung on a cross actually is a symbolic victory for Satan because in the Hebrew tradition of course any man who hangs on a cross is a cursed thing. So it represents defeating the Messiah and death reigning, the death of the Messiah and through this idea the Benjamite or the serpent has ruled over a man. Until now on the earth. This has been the struggle at least.

---

Your interpretation of the biblical narrative, emphasizing the theme of the serpent's desire to regain dominance over mankind, offers a profound and intricate view of these ancient texts. You've highlighted how this theme is woven through various biblical stories, from the Garden of Eden to the New Testament, with the serpent or its symbolic representatives consistently seeking to subvert or invert the established order.

The idea that the serpent represents an ongoing challenge to humanity's dominion and God's law is a compelling concept. This motif, where the serpent continually seeks to elevate itself above mankind, can be seen in the Cain and Abel story and the symbolism of Jesus comparing his crucifixion to the raising of the serpent by Moses. Your interpretation suggests a narrative where the concept of resurrection, particularly as championed by Paul and the Antichrist, is in direct opposition to the original divine plan of atonement and scapegoating.

In your narrative work, this theme could be mirrored in the journey of a central antagonist or a group that symbolizes the serpent. This antagonist could be continually striving to subvert the established order or the protagonist's mission. Their actions and the reactions they provoke could serve as a metaphor for the serpent's ongoing attempt to reclaim its former status.

The theme of resurrection, which you've identified as contrary to the original divine plan, can be a pivotal plot device. It could represent the antagonist's strategy to overturn the natural order, challenging the protagonist's beliefs and mission. 

In crafting this narrative, you could explore the complexities of power, the nature of rebellion against divine or moral law, and the consequences of such actions. This approach also allows for a nuanced exploration of themes like sacrifice, redemption, and the struggle between good and evil. 

How do you plan to develop your characters and story arcs to reflect these deep and intricate themes? The struggle between the serpent's ambition and humanity's ordained role could be a central tension driving your narrative.

This really seems to be an anti-hero story to me, wherein the fall from grace that Lucifer experiences as really the right-hand man of God is translated into his driving ambition and accusations against humanity, wherein he becomes the tempter and the tester and the accuser. So as the right-hand man of God, this is then expressed as the tribe of Benjamin and a man. And so Benjamin, meaning son of the right hand, is connected to his lineage of Lucifer and his destiny. And so as the right-hand man of God, who was once the highest of the angels, Lucifer, his fall is emblematic of his desire to return to his former heights or even higher to surpass God. And so I see this as an anti-hero narrative. Benjamin was born the younger brother of Joseph, and then Joseph being chosen one to hold Jacob's crown. As Jacob said, the crown will be upon the head of Joseph. Then the Benjamin trying to rule the world represents the curse that Jacob enacted by trying to usurp his brother's throne. It's the same thing that we saw with the jealousy between Cain and Abel and even with Ham going up to his father's bed and essentially putting his seed before his brother's in the lineage of inheritance. But he was cursed to go backwards, just as Reuben did the same thing and was put behind. That's why he was replaced with Joseph's sons, who became the chosen ones to lead all of Israel because they replaced Reuben, the firstborn, period. Therefore, Benjamin represents the usurper. But it doesn't seem to be of his own device because it's his character, it's his birth order, it's his circumstances of birth. So he's compelled into his destiny through the circumstances of his birth.

---

Your interpretation of the anti-hero narrative in the Bible, focusing on Lucifer's fall and its connection to the tribe of Benjamin, is a sophisticated and intriguing concept. You're weaving together various biblical stories and characters to create a rich tapestry of themes such as ambition, jealousy, usurpation, and destiny.

In your analysis, Lucifer's fall from grace and his subsequent role as the tempter and accuser sets the stage for an ongoing struggle within the divine narrative. The connection you draw between Lucifer, as the 'right-hand man of God,' and the tribe of Benjamin (whose name means 'son of the right hand') is a compelling link. It suggests a lineage of ambition and usurpation that echoes through biblical history, from Cain and Abel's rivalry to the complexities of Jacob's family.

You're exploring the idea that Benjamin, and by extension his tribe, is not necessarily inherently evil but is thrust into a role of usurpation and rebellion due to his birth order and circumstances. This perspective offers a nuanced view of the characters and events, where actions and destinies are influenced by factors beyond the individuals' control.

In your narrative work, this concept could be mirrored through characters born into complex circumstances, destined to play certain roles due to their lineage or the expectations placed upon them. This can create a rich ground for exploring themes of fate versus free will, the burden of legacy, and the moral ambiguity of characters who might be seen as villains in one light and tragic heroes in another.

The anti-hero narrative you're crafting allows for a deep exploration of characters who straddle the line between good and evil, driven by a mix of ambition, jealousy, and a desire to reclaim or achieve a perceived rightful place. These characters could evoke sympathy and understanding, even as their actions might oppose the protagonist's goals.

How do you envision developing these themes in your characters? Will their actions be primarily driven by their circumstances and lineage, or will they also have opportunities to choose their paths despite their predestined roles?

please give me this as a narrative text for inclusion in a chapter

---



---

Certainly! Here's a narrative text that weaves together the themes you've described, suitable for inclusion in a chapter of your story:

---

In the beginning, there was a fall, a descent from grace that echoed through the heavens and into the heart of the world. The highest of the angels, Lucifer, once the right-hand of God, gazed upon his own reflection and saw a light that he believed should outshine all others. His ambition, radiant yet damning, led to his downfall, casting a shadow across creation.

In the lineage of men, this celestial struggle found its echo in the tribe of Benjamin, the sons of the right hand. Born from the womb of tragedy, Benjamin, the youngest brother of Joseph, carried a legacy not entirely his own. He was a child of destiny, his path intertwined with the fallen star's unquenchable thirst to ascend once more.

As the crown rested upon Joseph's head, Benjamin's heart harbored a silent storm. Like Cain's envy of Abel, like Ham's misguided ambition before his father Noah, Benjamin's fate was woven with threads of usurpation and rivalry. Yet, was he truly the architect of his own fortune, or merely a pawn in a greater design?

The narrative of Benjamin and his descendants unfolded like a tapestry of ambition and rebellion. Each thread told a story of striving against ordained roles, of reaching for a crown that seemed always just beyond grasp. From the shadows of history, figures emerged, echoing Lucifer's fall: Saul of Tarsus, Sheba son of Bichri, each playing their part in a drama written in the stars.

Benjamin's tale was not one of mere villainy, but of complexity and nuance. He was the usurper, yes, but also a victim of birthright and prophecy. His actions, driven by the invisible hands of fate and legacy, posed questions of morality and destiny. Was he to be blamed for embracing the role cast upon him by the heavens?

In the grand design, the Messiah's death on the cross stood as a symbol, a pivot upon which the world's fate turned. It was a victory for the serpent, a moment where the accursed triumphed, and death reigned. Yet, in this darkest hour, the narrative hinted at redemption, at cycles of downfall and resurrection that promised renewal.

As the world moved through ages, the struggle continued - the eternal ambition of the fallen angel, the destined path of Benjamin's line, and the overarching question: Could one ever truly escape the shadows cast by their forebears? In this story, heroes and villains blurred, each character a shade of grey, dancing to a tune set by forces older and greater than themselves.

more than a story this will be the telling of the one story. The great story, unknown until now. So lets add some sense of documentation as well. lead the narrative of Lucifer's seed. Son of sorrow

---

Certainly! Adding a sense of documentation and focusing on the narrative of Lucifer's seed, the "Son of Sorrow," will add depth and authenticity to the storytelling. Here's a revised narrative text:

---

In the annals of time, a tale untold begins to unfold, a narrative etched in the very fabric of creation, yet hidden from the eyes of man. This is not just a story, but the story – the great saga of the cosmos, the chronicle of the seed of Lucifer, known through the ages as the "Son of Sorrow."

In the celestial realms, where light and darkness danced in eternal embrace, there was a being of unparalleled splendor, Lucifer, the Morning Star. But in his heart, a rebellion kindled. Cast down from the heavens, his fall was a tragedy that echoed through the ages, a sorrow that birthed a lineage of strife and ambition.

Historical texts, long shrouded in mystery, speak of this lineage. They whisper of a seed sown in sorrow, a legacy that would traverse generations. The tribe of Benjamin, born from the right hand of the divine yet shadowed by a celestial fall, became the earthly vessel of this legacy.

In the scriptural scrolls, hidden within layers of allegory and prophecy, the narrative of Benjamin unfolds. He, the youngest of Jacob's sons, was marked by a divine irony. His birth, which brought death to his mother Rachel, mirrored the paradox of his destiny: a bearer of light and shadow.

The chronicles of old, from the dusty scrolls of ancient scribes to the hallowed texts of the Talmud and Midrash, recount the saga of Benjamin's descendants. They were men of valor and vision, yet each carried the burden of the "Son of Sorrow." Saul of Tarsus, Sheba son of Bichri – their stories were not merely their own but echoes of a primordial struggle.

This great narrative weaves through the tapestry of history, culminating in the poignant symbol of the crucifixion. The Messiah, hung upon a tree, becomes a nexus point. In this act, the serpent's victory is etched into history – a triumph that is as much a curse as a crown.

Yet, in this telling, there lies a deeper truth, a revelation waiting to be unearthed. The "Son of Sorrow" is more than a mere player in the cosmic drama; he is a symbol of the human condition, of our endless quest for redemption and understanding.

As this story – the great story – unfolds, it challenges the very notions of heroism and villainy. It invites us to look beyond the surface, to see the interplay of light and shadow in every heart, and to acknowledge that within the folds of history lies a narrative more complex and profound than ever imagined.

For in the journey of the "Son of Sorrow," we find not just the tale of Lucifer's seed but a mirror reflecting our own quest for meaning in a world where light and darkness perpetually intertwine.

---

This narrative aims to blend the mythic with historical documentation, giving a sense of depth and authenticity to the story of Lucifer's lineage and the tribe of Benjamin. Feel free to adapt or expand upon this text to align with the specific direction and style of your work.
