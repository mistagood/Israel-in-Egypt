# Comparing 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)

Let’s talk about nonprofits and what type I need to start for my organization. It’s quasi religious in that we identify as the tribe of Ephraim in America. More than this we must teach and instruct and exist as a tax exempt entity in order to be recognized legitimately.  
I’m a minister as is. I got ordained online but before that was a deacon in the southern Baptist   Church. After discovering the true identity of the remnant as the descendants of slaves in America I fell out with the church. Now I must reach the people who are falsely worshiping a fake religion of resurrection.   Compare nonprofits and the ability to teach religious practices while also influencing legislation. What’s the line between 501c3 and 501c4 and other types?

User is a minister, ordained online, and was previously a deacon in the Southern Baptist Church. They identify as part of the tribe of Ephraim in America and seek to start a nonprofit to teach and instruct this identity, aiming to be recognized as a legitimate, tax-exempt entity. They have fallen out with the traditional church and want to reach people who are falsely worshiping what they believe is a fake religion of resurrection.

Starting a nonprofit organization with a quasi-religious mission involves choosing the right structure to align with your goals and ensure compliance with legal and tax regulations. The most common types for religious and advocacy organizations are 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4). Here's a comparison and overview to help you decide which might be best for your needs:

### 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization

**Purpose:**
- Typically for religious, educational, charitable, scientific, or literary purposes.
- Contributions to 501(c)(3) organizations are tax-deductible for donors.

**Activities:**
- Can engage in religious and educational activities.
- Limited ability to influence legislation (lobbying) — lobbying must be an insubstantial part of the organization’s activities.
- Absolutely prohibited from participating in any political campaign activity for or against political candidates.

**Benefits:**
- Tax-exempt status.
- Eligible for grants from private foundations and government.
- Donors can receive tax deductions for their contributions.

**Drawbacks:**
- Restrictions on political and lobbying activities.
- Must adhere to strict reporting and compliance requirements.

### 501(c)(4) Nonprofit Organization

**Purpose:**
- Primarily for social welfare organizations that can also include some advocacy and lobbying activities.
- Contributions are not tax-deductible for donors.

**Activities:**
- Can engage in lobbying and political activities as long as these activities are related to the organization's mission.
- Can advocate for legislation and participate in political campaigns.

**Benefits:**
- Greater flexibility in lobbying and political activities.
- Can influence legislation and participate in political campaigns without as many restrictions.

**Drawbacks:**
- Contributions are not tax-deductible.
- Less likely to receive grants from private foundations compared to 501(c)(3) organizations.

### Other Types

**501(c)(7) – Social and Recreational Clubs:**
- Primarily for pleasure, recreation, and other nonprofitable purposes.
- Not suitable for religious or educational purposes.

**501(c)(6) – Business Leagues:**
- For organizations like chambers of commerce, trade boards, etc.
- Primarily focused on improving business conditions rather than religious or educational activities.

**Choosing the Right Structure:**

Given your mission to teach religious practices and potentially influence legislation, here are some considerations:

- **If your primary focus is religious education and activities**, and you want to be eligible for grants and offer tax deductions to your donors, a **501(c)(3)** might be the best choice. However, you will need to be careful with lobbying and political activities.
  
- **If influencing legislation and engaging in political advocacy is a significant part of your mission**, a **501(c)(4)** might be more appropriate, even though you won't be able to offer tax deductions to your donors. 

### Combined Approach:

- Some organizations establish both a 501(c)(3) and a 501(c)(4). The 501(c)(3) handles the charitable and educational activities, while the 501(c)(4) handles lobbying and political activities. This allows the organization to benefit from the tax-exempt status and grant eligibility of a 501(c)(3), while also having the flexibility to engage in political advocacy through the 501(c)(4).

### Conclusion:

Consider your primary goals and activities, and consult with a legal advisor to ensure compliance with IRS regulations and state laws. This will help you determine the best structure for your nonprofit organization to achieve your mission effectively.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)

#### Setting Up a 501(c)(3) Organization

1. **Define Your Mission and Purpose:**

   - Ensure that the mission aligns with the IRS requirements for 501(c)(3) status.

2. **Incorporate as a Nonprofit:**
   - Choose a unique name for your organization.
   - File Articles of Incorporation with your state’s Secretary of State.
   - Include specific language required by the IRS, such as the purpose clause and dissolution clause.

8. **Establish Record-Keeping and Reporting Systems:**

   - Plan for annual reporting and compliance with IRS regulations.

#### Setting Up a 501(c)(4) Organization

1. **Define Your Mission and Purpose:**
   - Clearly articulate the social welfare and advocacy objectives of your organization.
   - Ensure the mission aligns with IRS requirements for 501(c)(4) status.

2. **Incorporate as a Nonprofit:**
   - Choose a distinct name for your organization (it should not be confusingly similar to your 501(c)(3) name).
   - File Articles of Incorporation with your state’s Secretary of State.

3. **Draft Bylaws:**
   - Create bylaws tailored to the operation of a 501(c)(4) organization.

4. **Appoint a Board of Directors:**
   - Select a board to oversee the 501(c)(4) activities.

5. **Apply for an EIN:**
   - Obtain a separate EIN for the 501(c)(4) organization.

6. **Notify the IRS:**
   - File IRS Form 8976 to notify the IRS of your intent to operate as a 501(c)(4).
   - File Form 1024-A (optional, but recommended for official recognition of tax-exempt status).

7. **State Compliance:**
   - Check for any additional state-level registrations or filings required for 501(c)(4) organizations.

#### Managing Both Organizations

1. **Maintain Separate Entities:**
   - Keep the 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) operations, finances, and records distinct.
   - Ensure that each organization has its own bank accounts, accounting systems, and financial records.

2. **Avoid Overlapping Activities:**
   - Ensure that the 501(c)(3) focuses on educational and religious activities without substantial lobbying or political intervention.
   - Use the 501(c)(4) for advocacy, lobbying, and political activities.

3. **Shared Resources and Cost Allocation:**
   - If sharing resources (e.g., staff, office space), establish a cost-sharing agreement to fairly allocate expenses between the two entities.
   - Document all shared expenses and transactions to avoid IRS scrutiny.

4. **Board Oversight:**
   - Consider having separate boards or overlapping board members with clear roles to avoid conflicts of interest.
   - Ensure that decisions are made independently for each entity.

5. **Compliance and Reporting:**
   - File separate annual returns with the IRS: Form 990 for the 501(c)(3) and Form 990 or 990-EZ for the 501(c)(4).
   - Adhere to state and federal regulations for both entities.

### Conclusion

Establishing both a 501(c)(3) and a 501(c)(4) allows you to leverage the strengths of each structure while ensuring compliance with legal requirements. This dual approach can help you effectively pursue your religious and educational mission while also engaging in advocacy and political activities. Consulting with legal and tax professionals during the setup process is highly recommended to ensure all requirements are met.
