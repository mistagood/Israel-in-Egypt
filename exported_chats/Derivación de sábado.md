# Derivación de sábado



---

Is the Spanish word sabado from the Hebrew sabbath, or does it have another derivation?

---

Yes, the Spanish word **sábado** (Saturday) **does derive directly from the Hebrew word** **שַׁבָּת (shabbat)**, meaning "rest" or "cessation."

### Etymological Path:

1. **Hebrew: שַׁבָּת (shabbat)**  
   – Meaning: rest, cessation (as from labor)  
   – Root: ש־ב־ת (shin–bet–tav), meaning "to cease, rest"

2. **Greek: σάββατον (sábbaton)**  
   – Adopted during the Hellenistic period, especially through the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures)

3. **Latin: sabbatum**  
   – Carried over into ecclesiastical Latin as Christianity spread in the Roman Empire

4. **Old Spanish: sábado**  
   – From Latin *sabbatum*, with the typical phonetic evolution into modern Spanish.

### Linguistic Note:
The term *sábado* was retained in Spanish and other Romance languages (e.g., *samedi* in French, from Latin *sabbatum dies* via Vulgar Latin *sambati dies*). However, in **Spanish**, the connection to **"Sabbath"** is particularly clear and preserved phonetically.

### Important Distinction:
Although modern Spanish speakers might associate *sábado* with the secular calendar (Saturday), **its root remains unmistakably biblical**, specifically Hebrew.

So yes, **sábado comes from Sabbath**—through a clear and documented line of linguistic transmission from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to Spanish.
