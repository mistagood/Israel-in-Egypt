# Judas Iscariot Analysis



---



---

Taking notes. I need this all organized and expanded:

Judas Iscariot.  Sicari-ot.  I'm reasoning here, looking at this article, which actually is built on work that I'm finding, in many ways, may support my research in biblical exploration and exposition. Given what we know about the misunderstandings of what happened at the cross with Jesus and Judas and who died and the story that's been told, we understand that there was a lot that has been lost to history. In the story that most people understand about the Bible. So, this begins to break down the idea that Jerusalem or the Jews were all one people. And so we can see the different factions that Jesus was dealing with. And so we know that Simon Peter was called a zealot. This article says that the Pharisees were the most closely aligned with the Saqqari ideals and were the most likely to be sympathetic. So we can begin to piece together ideas that maybe Simon was a Pharisee and even close to the zealots because he is the one that grabbed a knife and cut off the guard's ear. Given the kind of Messiah that Jesus was turning out to be, it would stand to reason, and we are reasoning here, it would stand to reason that they were expecting a more revolutionary, leader. And when Jesus didn't turn out to be going in that direction, but was more of a man of the people and healing, even wearing perfume and such, I think this is where we can determine that they were saying that there was a betrayal coming because this man was not showing the signs of being a zealous type of Messiah, but a zealotic figure they were looking for, the kind of fire zeal that he had shown when he entered the temple. And so Judas is a figure who, when we try to look into his history and even why he was there with the disciples, we tend to hit a wall. His name is not recognizable. Iscariot. No one really knows where that comes from or what it means. It's not a family name or anything else. And so we have to realize that this word Iscariot is what he is being called, just like Simon is being called Simon Peter at times. It is a descriptive name. So this Iscariot means he's the Sicari. It's a corruption of the word Sicari. So he was a Sicari. And he is also called the son of Simon. And so we understand that Simon and Judas were the pharisaic and Sicari element that Jesus had. Simon being the father of Judas and Judas being the more perhaps devout or devoted, he was enlisted by Simon as he was the person sitting next to Jesus, who was the beloved disciple. The one who, Psalm 41 says, shared a meal with Jesus. And so we know that Jesus said, it's the one who dips with me or who I give the sop to. Now, we know giving a sop in itself is a personal thing. So when he gives a sop to someone, we know that this is a person that's very close to the one I give the sop to is the same as saying the one who I share meals with. And so reasoning and logically understanding that the closest person to Jesus would be the betrayer. He would be the closest person sitting to Jesus at that table or at that meal. And he will be the one who was laying on his chest and he will be the one who Jesus handed the sop to. So when Simon and Judas and Jesus are all interacting together, we see the players. So Simon signals to the person who was not named at the time as Judas, but is laying on Jesus's bosom. And it's called the beloved disciple. To ask Jesus who will be the one to turn him in. Jesus gives the sop to Judas while speaking to that individual who asked him the question. So these are the people involved in this scenario. And we know that after this, Jesus also said to him, now, this is a person Simon signaled to who's close enough to talk to Jesus. So Jesus is only speaking to one person because nobody else can hear these things. And so when he gets up and walks out, nobody knows what he's gone to do. That means that only Judas knew that he was to be the betrayer. And so when all of them said, is it I and asked, none of them knew who was to be the betrayer. It was only after the sop was given that who the betrayer would be was revealed because it says the devil entered him at that time. And so before that, nobody knew who it would be. So when Jesus said to Judas, go and do it quickly. He was referring to the thing that Judas had just asked him who will betray you. And he basically said, it's going to be you go and do it now. OK, this is the mystery around these things. And so to understand that Judas is the beloved disciple. Is to understand why Judas then went to the high priest, because we know that this person who followed with Peter was known to the high priest. 
Only Judas is mentioned as having spoken with the high priest and being given abandonment. So we know that Judas is the one who was present at the garden. All of the others ran away. And Judas and Peter, father and son, followed closely behind. Peter stayed outside, but Judas was known to the high priest, so he went in and he talked to the girl at the gate and got Peter in. Okay, now this is using logic and not assumption. We're using the pieces of the puzzle that we have, and we're fitting them together in the most logical pattern to see a picture that makes sense.  
So we can see that Judas was caught up in political maneuvering above his head.  Simon pushed him to ask Jesus.  When Judas knew they would kill Jesus he determined to intervene at his own peril.  All the others fled in fear and denied knowing Jesus but Judas stood firm and denounced them saying that Jesus was innocent.  This is not the act of a villain.  This is the act of a man who was caught up and led into sin.  A man who repented and sought atonement for his actions.  He sought to atone for the betrayal of innocent blood. We have to look carefully at the text here because the chief priest instructed him to see to that himself. So only blood can atone for blood, especially the blood of the innocent, should be required at the hands of man. And so the only atonement for Judas would be his own blood. And so he would need to stand in in place of Jesus in order for Jesus to be saved or to not be killed. And perfectly this formed the atonement ritual. This is the highest understanding of how real Moses's law is to our practical functioning. It's not a hypothetical. It's not a metaphorical abstract that we cannot access. It is the act of replacing sin with righteousness. It is the act of removing sin. And what Judas was trying to do was trying to make right his sin. So he gave the money back. He refused to gain from it. And then he sought to make it right. That was his task when he left. He threw the money back and was going to make it right. They told him, see to that yourself. And so I betrayed innocent blood. See to that yourself. That means that you have to atone for that with blood. And so most people think that Judas went out and hanged himself in a field. That is a misunderstanding. But the symbolic atonement, blood for blood. But what actually happened that hanging was Judas being hung on a cross. He offered himself in place and Pilate was able to do the switch out as we know. So when he cast lots, when he gave them a choice on who would be released, this is the fulfillment of the atonement. It proves in so many ways that God is a liar, that atonement is real. And so Jesus goes in and is saved at the last moment because he is obedient, because he is righteous. And so just like Isaac in the last moments, a replacement is found even when the knife is above him. So even when Jesus is in the judgment hall, a replacement is found. And that replacement was Judas. And because all the Jews were outside, because they didn't want to be defiled, they wanted to eat the Passover, they had no idea who was crucifying. Pilate had his guards beat the other man and dress him up like a king and then bring him back out and present him. And they said crucify him. And so he turned him over to them. That was Judas. That was the ploy for them. He knew they would say crucify him. They had already said this. They already said they wanted to kill him. So when he dressed them in the robes, it was just infuriating them. He did that just to infuriate them before he handed them over this man. It was a distraction, in fact, because he could have just given them Jesus if he wanted to crucify Jesus. But instead he goes through this whole act of a coronation. It's a mock coronation in many ways. And then he brings him out as the king and presents him and says, hey, this is your king, very particularly. And so they say, well, crucify that man. And he says, are you sure you want me to crucify this man? Shall I crucify your king? And they say, yes. And so that is the most assured way to pull something like this off. And it's being told to us precisely. And when people don't understand why these things happen and explain them away, it doesn't follow logic necessarily. And even if it does, it doesn't fit the puzzle as well as this.
