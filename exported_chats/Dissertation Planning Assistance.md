Absolutely, I can assist you with that! Since you're looking to create a dissertation, it would be beneficial to outline some specific parameters and objectives for the research. 

Here's what we need to consider:

1. **Title**: What will be the main focus or title of the dissertation?

2. **Research Questions**: What are the key questions you want to answer through this research? 

3. **Literature Review**: What existing research, theories, or methodologies will you analyze to set the context for your study?

4. **Methodology**: What methods will you use to collect and analyze data? Will it be qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method research?

5. **Hypothesis**: If applicable, what hypotheses are you aiming to test or explore?

6. **Significance**: How does this research contribute to your field, particularly in the areas of mythology, African American studies, and theological interpretations? 

7. **Timeline**: What will be the timeline for completing different sections of the dissertation?

8. **Ethical Considerations**: If your research involves human subjects or sensitive data, what ethical guidelines will you follow?

9. **Resources Needed**: What resources or support do you need to carry out this research?

Once we have this information, we can develop a comprehensive dissertation proposal or outline. Feel free to provide as much or as little detail as you wish, and we can build from there.

1. Parent journeys in special education

2.

my study of parent interactions in independent educational programs meetings with schools. These meetings plan educational outcomes for students with special needs. In this meeting, which is legally mandated by IDEA legislation brings parents together into asymmetrical power systems, and situations with professional educators. I study the interactions between the parents the school districts as a relates to the power dynamics and parents role as advocates and their mandate to maintain high expectations for the outcomes and education. This may often cause tensions in the meetings. My focus is on how the heroes journey relates to the transformative experience of parents, having a child with special needs born to them, and then having to advocate against school districts, which may be considered a David vs Goliath situation. How do parents perceive their role in the greater scheme of things? I hypothesize that this experience and journey transforms parents into a hero advocate. Teasing out the roles of religion, mythology, societal roles, economic structures, and power that come into play in the psychology of parents and district officials in the meetings where parent usually acquiesce to low standards and silently suffer as their children fail and lose hope. What makes a difference in a parent who becomes an advocate, and takes on the school system, as opposed to a parent who never makes the transition, and continues to, except what is offered by the district out of frustration, or fear and intimidation.

How do parents navigate complex power differentials in fields of multiple experts, while maintaining authority and identity as parents and former identities as experts in the individualized education program (IEP) meetings and setting? How do language culture, socioeconomic and historic backgrounds come into play? What are the parallels with the hero’s journey and what archetypes are involved as parents navigate the new dangerous world? What are the strategies parents used to overcome the obstacles and how do these transform their identities into the parrot hero through this journey?


4. Mixed methods Narrative analysis
Interaction analysis including audio and video,
Discourse analysis. 
Participant observation and interviews. 
Ethnography/auto-ethnography

5. Parents develop a sense of a destiny when faced with the world changing experience of a child born with autism or special need. They go through a cycle akin to the hero’s journey. My work parallels and transposes their narratives and life experiences onto the hero’s journey. It is this experience that turns them into heroes or advocates.

Thank you for the detailed information! It's evident that your dissertation work is a complex, multidisciplinary study that intersects various fields such as urban education, mythology, psychology, and socioeconomics. Here's a rough outline of how your dissertation could be structured based on the information you've provided:

### Dissertation Outline:

#### Chapter 1: Introduction
- Background of the study
- Statement of the problem
- Objectives and research questions
- Hypothesis
- Significance of the study
- Scope and limitations
- Overview of methodology

#### Chapter 2: Literature Review
- A review of the literature related to IDEA legislation, special education, power dynamics, and the hero's journey.
- Analysis of theories from Hamilton, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Campbell, Foucault, Du Bois, Butler, and others as they apply to your research.
- Identification of gaps in existing research that your study aims to fill.

#### Chapter 3: Methodology
- Detailed description of your mixed methods approach, including narrative analysis, interaction analysis, discourse analysis, participant observation, and interviews.
- Ethnographic/auto-ethnographic approaches.
- Ethical considerations, including IRB guidelines.

#### Chapter 4: Findings
- Presentation of the data collected, including narratives, interview transcripts, video, and IEP documents.
- Analyzing how parents navigate complex power differentials, linguistic and cultural barriers, and how the hero’s journey and archetypes are involved in their transformative experience.
- Insights into strategies parents use to overcome obstacles and transform into hero advocates.

#### Chapter 5: Discussion
- Interpretation of the findings in the context of the existing literature.
- Consideration of economic structures, societal roles, the psychology of parents and district officials, and the parallels with mythological hero journeys.
- Discussion on parents’ perception of their role, the impact of religion, mythology, and historical backgrounds.

#### Chapter 6: Conclusion

- Implications for practice in urban schooling, special education, and parent advocacy.
- Recommendations for future research.
- Conclusion reflecting the journey of the parents and their transformation into hero advocates.

#### References
- Full citation of all the literature and theories used in APA format.

### Timeline:
A rigorous six-month timeline would need to be further broken down into specific milestones for each chapter, data collection, analysis, and revisions.

### Resources:
- Comprehensive literature review.
- Synthesized theoretical framework.
- Access to narratives, interview transcripts, video, IEP documents.

Given the richness of this topic and the intersection of various theories, it's essential to have clear linkages and logical flow throughout the dissertation. Continuous consultation with your advisors and consideration of peer feedback can also enhance the quality of your work.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to focus on or expand further? Any additional guidance or directions will be helpful.
