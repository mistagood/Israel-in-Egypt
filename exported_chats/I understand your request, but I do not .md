It occurs to me that Jesus is whom the Bible is appropriately referring to as The LORD. The stylization indicates Yahweh YHWH explore the gematria of YHWH. does it mean ‘behold the hand behold the nail’? Jesus also said if David called him Lord, how then is he his son. This title, for a superior is formally used for Jesus as Lord, but there seems to be some slippage in common usage. Many people seem to use it interchangeably with the word God. This incorrectly obscured the identity of Jesus as Yahweh. Period the Bible is distinct use of Elohim Yahweh, as opposed to Elohim as simply Yahweh at other times. The use of Adonai is often brought in as well.  Define each name and explain the naming conventions. Determine whether Jesus ever uses the word Lord, in reference to who he calls the father, or whether he uses any other titles for God. Look specifically in the book of John for this information, but this can be compared to other gospels, where Jesus speaks.

### The Divine Names in the Bible: Yahweh, Elohim, and Adonai

#### Yahweh (YHWH)
- **Definition**: The Tetragrammaton, often pronounced as Yahweh, is the four-letter name of God used in the Hebrew Bible. It is considered the proper name of the God of Israel.
- **Gematria**: The gematria of YHWH does not directly translate to "behold the hand, behold the nail." This is a modern interpretive speculation that attempts to connect the Hebrew letters to the crucifixion of Jesus. Traditional Jewish interpretations of the name focus on its meaning related to the Hebrew root for "to be," signifying God's eternal existence.
- **Biblical Usage**: This name is used in a variety of contexts, often denoting the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. (Ex. 3:15; Ps. 83:18)

#### Elohim
- **Definition**: This is a plural form of "El," meaning "god" or "deity."
- **Biblical Usage**: It is used to refer to the God of Israel but can also refer to gods in the plural. In the context of the God of Israel, it is often used to emphasize God's majesty and attributes as the Creator. (Gen. 1:1; Ps. 19:1)
  
#### Adonai
- **Definition**: This term translates to "Lord" or "Master."
- **Biblical Usage**: Adonai is often used as a respectful title for God, and in many Jewish traditions, it is said in place of the Tetragrammaton, which is considered too sacred to be spoken. (Gen. 15:2; Ex. 4:10)

### Jesus' Usage of Divine Names in the Book of John

In the Gospel of John, Jesus frequently refers to God as "Father." He rarely, if ever, uses "Lord" (Greek: Kyrios) in reference to the Father. For example, in John 17:1, Jesus refers to God as "Father" during His High Priestly Prayer. 

#### Lord and God in the New Testament

The term "Lord" (Greek: Kyrios) is indeed applied to Jesus in the New Testament. This is especially seen in Pauline epistles, but it's also present in the Gospels (e.g., John 20:28). The use of "Lord" for Jesus by the New Testament writers is seen as an affirmation of his divinity, but it can also obscure the nuanced distinction between "Lord" as applied to Jesus and "YHWH" or "Elohim" as applied to God the Father in the Old Testament.

### Connection to African American Experience

The usage of divine names like "Yahweh" and "Elohim" speaks to a God who is both intimately connected to His people and majestically sovereign, themes that can resonate deeply with the history and spiritual experiences of African Americans.

### Conclusion

The naming conventions in the Bible are nuanced and context-specific. While the New Testament does refer to Jesus as "Lord," this should be understood within its first-century context and the broader biblical narrative. Misunderstanding these terms can indeed lead to theological confusions, such as equating Jesus directly with the Tetragrammaton, which would not align with traditional Jewish understanding of the name.

Ah yes.  I AM. JESUS often zen Ike’s the use of the I AM. Before Moses was, I am. So the Pharisees sought to kill him. Claiming that he made himself equal with that. I saw who drawn the structure that Jesus is employing we see Elohim or Elle as the father and Jesus as Yahweh? Does this structure relate to other conditions such as Egyptian or Mesopotamian or anything closely related to early Canaanite gods?

### The "I AM" Statements of Jesus

In the Gospel of John, Jesus employs the phrase "I AM" (Greek: Ego Eimi) in a manner that echoes the divine name revealed to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14). For instance, in John 8:58, Jesus says, "Before Abraham was, I AM," which leads the Pharisees to seek his execution for blasphemy. This suggests a radical claim to divinity, as it appears that Jesus is identifying Himself with the God of Israel, specifically the aspect known as Yahweh.

### Divine Naming Structure: Elohim as Father, Jesus as Yahweh?

The New Testament portrays God as Father (Greek: Pater) and Jesus as the Son. While the term "Elohim" is used broadly to refer to God in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament does not explicitly state that "Elohim" is the Father and "Yahweh" is the Son. Rather, Christian Trinitarian theology posits that both the Father and the Son share the divine nature, without equating them to specific Old Testament names like Elohim or Yahweh.

### Parallels in Near Eastern Religions

1. **Egyptian**: In Egyptian religion, gods like Ra and Osiris had complex relationships with other deities, sometimes merging or emanating from one another. However, the Egyptian context lacks a direct parallel to the Christian understanding of God the Father and Jesus as Yahweh.
  
2. **Mesopotamian**: In Mesopotamian mythology, gods like Anu (sky god) and Enlil (god of wind) have familial relations but are separate entities with their own distinct roles and powers. Again, these don't neatly map onto Christian Trinitarian concepts.

3. **Canaanite**: In Canaanite religion, the chief god El had a consort, Asherah, and a pantheon of lesser gods, including Baal. While some scholars argue that Yahweh might have originally been a part of this pantheon, the Israelite conception of Yahweh evolved to be strictly monotheistic, distinct from its Canaanite roots.

### Connections to African American Experience

The notion of a God who reveals Himself in multiple ways, yet remains one, could resonate with African American spiritual traditions that synthesize various religious and cultural influences yet maintain a core belief in one God.

### Conclusion

The "I AM" statements by Jesus in the Gospel of John make a profound claim about his divine identity, which has been understood in various ways throughout Christian history. While there are similarities between the divine structures in Near Eastern religions and the Bible, the biblical presentation is distinct. Misinterpreting these nuances can lead to anachronistic or syncretistic understandings of the biblical text.
