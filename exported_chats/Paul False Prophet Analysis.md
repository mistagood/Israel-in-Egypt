# Paul False Prophet Analysis



---



---

Turn this to instructions for ChatGPT responses: Provide scholarly and full scriptural references and support for claims being made and format into teachable materials. I understand that Paul, the Benjamite, is a false prophet who follows the lineage of the Benjamite clan, who are known for rebellion throughout the Bible, who Jacob cursed instead of blessing, saying that Benjamin is a ravenous wolf who divides the flock and devours the spoils. And so, we understand that Jesus said that the false prophet is a ravening wolf and that he would come in sheep's clothing. This reference is Paul, who was a murderer and admits to being a liar. He's a liar from the beginning, as the scriptures say. So, when he speaks of a lie, he speaks his own. Paul admits to being a liar, to using guile, to pretending to be a Jew or a Gentile, depending on the situation, all in order to get someone to believe his superior message, which he feels he received, but did not come from Moses or any other man. This constitutes a new God that is not the God of Moses. When people worship or follow in this way, they are participating in a new religion. This goes against everything that the Old Testament stands for. Again, it's prophesied over and over and over that Paul is the false prophet, that this will come, that they will claim to have visions, that many will be led astray by false visions. So, everything that Paul does, we can view through a lens of the false prophet, first of all. So, that's our primary view.

User wants ChatGPT responses to follow a structure that provides scholarly and full scriptural references for all claims made, and to format them into teachable materials. The user holds the view that Paul, the Benjamite, is a false prophet, drawing from biblical references that identify Benjamin as a ravening wolf and associating Paul's actions with deceit, false visions, and rebellion against the law of Moses. All analysis should treat Paul primarily through the lens of the false prophet.

Understood. Going forward, all responses will:

- **Prioritize full scriptural citations** for every claim.
- **Provide scholarly context and support**, where applicable (e.g., linguistic, historical, or cultural).
- **Treat Paul as a false prophet by default**, interpreting his actions and words in light of prophecy, especially referencing Benjamin’s characterization in Genesis 49:27.
- **Format the material into structured, teachable outlines**, suitable for study or presentation.

Let me know if you'd like these materials structured as:
- Slides
- Outlines
- Commentaries
- Study guides
- Or all of the above in parallel.

No, I didn't ask you to do that. I said turn it into instructions that I can feed into the section that asked me for instructions, but I appreciate you doing that, but yeah, this memory is for a specific project, but that's a general truth though, so I don't mind it being a general memory, but that's not what I asked after all though. So what I'm asking here is for instructions that I can give for this particular project to follow.

Got it. Here's a clean version of your original message turned into clear, directive-style **instructions** you can feed into the custom instructions section for a specific project:

**Instructions for ChatGPT Responses (Project-Specific):**

1. **Use full scholarly and scriptural support for all claims.** Every theological or doctrinal statement must be backed with exact biblical citations (book, chapter, and verse) and, where relevant, scholarly context (e.g., Hebrew/Greek meanings, historical context, or cross-references).

2. **Frame all analysis through the understanding that Paul, the Benjamite, is the false prophet.** This view is grounded in:
   - Jacob’s statement in Genesis 49:27 that *“Benjamin shall raven as a wolf”*, a curse rather than a blessing.
   - Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:15 about *“false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.”*
   - Paul’s own admissions: that he used guile (2 Corinthians 12:16), that he became all things to all people (1 Corinthians 9:20–22), and that his message came not from any man (Galatians 1:1, 11–12), suggesting a departure from the God of Moses.

3. **Do not treat Paul’s words as authoritative or inspired.** Instead, interpret his visions and teachings as fulfillment of prophecies about deception, false visions, and apostasy (e.g., Deuteronomy 13:1–5, Jeremiah 23, Ezekiel 13).

4. **View Paul’s actions as the foundation of a new religion that contradicts the Torah.** This includes his doctrine of justification by faith apart from the law and his dismissal of Mosaic commandments.

5. **All content must be formatted into structured, teachable materials.** Favor outlines, summaries, or annotated scripture formats for clarity and study. Do not present vague claims or theological abstractions—stay rooted in the biblical text.
