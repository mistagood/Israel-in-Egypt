Did people think Abraham Lincoln was mixed when he became the president?

Short answer: yes—some of Lincoln’s opponents did push that smear. In 1860–64, Democratic and secessionist outlets racialized him with language like “sooty…of the dirtiest complexion” and even ran the notorious “miscegenation” campaign materials to brand him as favoring race-mixing; one Copperhead pamphlet styled him “Abraham Africanus I.” citeturn10search0turn12search2turn12search12turn0search10

But historians don’t accept that he was of mixed Black ancestry, and modern genealogical/DNA work on his mother’s line (Nancy Hanks) identifies a European maternal lineage; the rumor remains unsubstantiated. citeturn9view0turn5search4

Net: the idea circulated as partisan mudslinging, not as a credible or majority belief. citeturn12search20

What’s copperheads. Please explain 

---

Copperheads were Northern “Peace Democrats” during the U.S. Civil War who opposed Lincoln’s war policy and emancipation, pushing instead for a negotiated peace with the Confederacy. Republicans nicknamed them after the venomous copperhead snake; many Peace Democrats later embraced the label and wore the Liberty Head (copper) penny’s “head” as a badge. Their strength clustered in the lower Midwest (southern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois). citeturn0search4turn0search0

They fought Lincoln at the ballot box and in the press. Copperhead editors and operatives churned out propaganda, including the anonymous 1863 “Miscegenation” pamphlet—a New York World hoax crafted to smear Republicans as champions of interracial marriage—and the 1864 booklet Abraham Africanus I portraying Lincoln as a tyrant. These were the kind of pieces people mean by a “Copperhead pamphlet.” citeturn0search2turn0search10turn0search11turn0search3

Their most famous leader was Ohio’s Clement L. Vallandigham, arrested in 1863 under General Ambrose Burnside’s Order No. 38 for speeches deemed to undermine the war effort—an episode that made Copperheads a national flashpoint. citeturn0search1turn0search5turn0search9

So the penny itself became an anti Lincoln statement? 

---



---



---



---



---

Yes. Peace Democrats (“Copperheads”) literally wore the **copper cent’s Liberty head** as a lapel badge—sometimes the whole coin pierced, sometimes the Liberty portrait cut out—to signal opposition to Lincoln and the war. It was a punning reclaim of the slur “copperhead” (the snake): they made it a “copper **head**” of Liberty. Contemporary and later accounts describe the badge exactly this way. citeturn0search0turn1search1turn1search7turn1search0

And “Short answer: yes—some of Lincoln’s opponents did push that smear. In 1860–64, “ Why is that a smear? So what if it were true? Did Lincoln deny it? 

Feels horribly wrong that you still classify that as a smear even in 2025. We still prevailingly uphold the idea that Lincoln as a black man becoming president was distasteful or undesired by the nation. Remember there were actually free blacks. The debate was about slavery, not his being black. 
Wasn’t it more about his sympathy and predisposition towards possible abolition? 
Historians refuse to acknowledge the common rumors and widespread printing as well as belief in and plausibility of it.  Typical slavery era historians lean extra heavily on the local anecdotes and testimony of the period as informed sources of public or common knowledge. Here they look at one parents dna and say well his mom had some European dna so he couldn’t have been mixed? 
Partisans mudslinging is about taking the truth and distorting it to capitalize on peoples fears.

Here’s what that line meant, without any 2025 baggage:

**Why call it a “smear”?**  
Because in 1863–64 Democratic operatives at the New York *World* manufactured a fake “Republican” pamphlet titled *Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races…* and pushed cartoons like “The Miscegenation Ball” to make it look as if Lincoln’s party officially promoted interracial marriage. It was a deliberate disinformation tactic—authorship concealed, attribution falsified, and timed for the 1864 election. That’s what “smear” denotes here: a hoax crafted to weaponize prevailing racist sentiment, not a judgment that interracial marriage (or Black ancestry) is shameful. citeturn3view0turn5search3turn5search1

**“So what if it were true?” (the 1860s political context)**  
Even many free states criminalized interracial marriage in this era; Illinois, Lincoln’s own state, didn’t repeal its ban until 1874. Hoaxers knew tying Republicans to “amalgamation” could peel white votes, especially among antiwar Democrats (Copperheads). So the pamphlet targeted fear, not policy detail. citeturn7search0turn7search2

**Did Lincoln deny it?**  
On the hoax itself, Lincoln refused to take the bait and stayed publicly silent—precisely the outcome the plotters feared wouldn’t happen. That silence is noted in contemporary and later analyses of the episode. citeturn5search8  
What Lincoln *did* say, earlier, under heavy pressure in the 1858 debates, was that he did **not** support social/political equality or intermarriage—a stance reflecting broad Northern prejudice then, not the policy he ultimately drove on emancipation and Black military service. Those remarks are in the debate transcripts. citeturn0search9turn0search14

**Was the fight really about slavery (not his being “Black”)?**  
Both. Copperhead messaging blurred abolition with interracial equality to make emancipation feel personally threatening to white voters. The “miscegenation” hoax worked *because* the war over slavery was the backdrop and anti-miscegenation laws gave the scare teeth. The aim wasn’t to debate policy but to stigmatize Republicans by association. citeturn5search21turn5search2

**Do historians ignore the rumors of Lincoln’s ancestry?**  
They don’t ignore them; they classify them as unsubstantiated partisan-era claims. Modern work on Nancy Hanks’s maternal line (mtDNA study tracing Lincoln’s matriline to rare haplogroup X1c) addresses only the mother’s side and doesn’t “prove” anything about autosomal ancestry. It does show that the oft-repeated “we can’t trace his mother” trope is weaker than advertised—but it doesn’t validate the 1860s race-baiting rumors. citeturn8search7

Bottom line: calling it a “smear” is about method and intent—an anonymized hoax that misrepresented Republican positions to inflame racist laws and norms of the day. It doesn’t label interracial identity itself as shameful; it names the 1864 dirty trick for what it was. citeturn5search0

Well, if that's correct, then obviously it didn't work and overwhelmingly people didn't care about that. So it seems like they were talking to their own base and trying to fire up their own base about it. But the last response is insufficient because I understand what a smear is. I'm not asking you why it was a smear. I know why they were using it as a smear. What I'm talking about is why you, the historians, are still calling it a smear when, yes, it was designed to smear his name to people who were sympathetic towards their own cause. But overwhelmingly the country was not. And regardless of whether Lincoln supported interracial marriage or not, it has no bearing on his race. That's two separate things. One is political and one is genetic. Your genetics do not determine your political position. So using that as a support doesn't pan out. The whole point is that historians and you, through the information that you've been given in these modern times, still find reasons find reasons to think that Lincoln's parentage having a mixed descent is a negative thing or something that needs to be proven or disproved. The historians work very hard to discredit and say that things are unsubstantiated. That's the whole point of looking at old writings. Is that they do the substantiating of the ideas that we have now. And so they're using that in a disingenuous way. The fact is that this can have nothing to do with lies any more than today's partisan politics have to do with lies about someone's race. have to do with lies about someone's race. Rather, it talks about their connections to groups and their positions towards groups. So saying something like that ties him to certain positions, not to an automatic rejection because of his DNA. That's the point I'm making is that we're misclassifying the times when we see that this is a man that was clearly leaning this direction, and yet he was still elected. But we want to portray that the country would not have responded positively to a man who came from mixed lineage as if there weren't millions of people from mixed lineage all over the country, just like there are now. So it's kind of ridiculous because the idea that we're really doing is promoting the racism today and we're implanting it even stronger into the past when they were fighting it. These are people that were banded together and fought a war ending slavery, and yet our modern lens through the historians is that it was such a delicate thing that no one would accept a person of mixed lineage as president, that it was a smear on him as opposed to just simply part of his American heritage that maybe wasn't talked about in public, but was not such an anomaly as we try to make it. I think the very point that they're pointing it out shows that it's not an anomaly, but that it's a common possibility and that they're trying to warn their own constituents and people and rally the base to vote, not that they're trying to transform the other side to vote for them. So you can't accept these things that just treat because they don't make any sense. I'm talking about the way we're talking about it, not the way they talked about it. I know that they were racist. I know that they were trying to win an election. I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about us and our framing and our refusal to even look at history through a proper historical lens.

You’re right to separate **genetics** from **political messaging**. Here’s a cleaner frame that doesn’t reinscribe 1860s racism onto 2025:

**1) What we should call it.**  
Keep two lanes distinct:  
- *Lane A (politics):* the 1863–64 **race-baiting disinformation tactic**—the *Miscegenation* hoax pamphlet engineered by New York *World* staffers David G. Croly and George Wakeman, plus spin-offs like the “Miscegenation Ball.” That was an anonymized forgery meant to inflame voters; calling *that* a smear names the tactic, not any ancestry. citeturn0search0turn0search5  
- *Lane B (ancestry rumor):* claims that Lincoln himself had recent Black ancestry. Those circulated in opposition media (e.g., the 1864 **Abraham Africanus I** pamphlet), but they remain **unproven** as history because the evidentiary bar isn’t met—not because mixed ancestry would be shameful. citeturn1search0turn1search8

**2) Did voters “not care”?**  
The hoaxers failed to flip the country: Lincoln won in 1864 with ~55.1% of the popular vote and a 212–21 electoral margin. That outcome supports your point that the tactic mostly stoked the anti-Lincoln base rather than persuading the median voter. citeturn0search9turn0search14

**3) Mixed-heritage Americans were visible in the record.**  
The federal census explicitly tallied “mulatto” from 1850 (and again in 1860, 1870; also 1890, 1910, 1920), which shows the state recognized a large multiracial reality—exactly the point you’re making. The Census Bureau’s own historical summaries note the category and its use; an 1860 statistical volume even computed proportions of “mulattoes” within the “colored population.” None of that maps to Lincoln’s ancestry; it shows the **social backdrop** against which the hoaxers played. citeturn2search0turn2search8turn2search1

**4) Why historians say “unsubstantiated” on Lincoln’s ancestry.**  
Standards of proof matter. Modern genealogists have strengthened the **maternal** line: a 2015 study of matrilineal relatives of Nancy Hanks identified a rare mtDNA haplogroup (X1c), clarifying her maternal kin. That’s just mtDNA (mother’s line only); it can’t settle the entire tree, but it *does* reduce space for certain popular origin tales. Labeling the ancestry rumor “unsubstantiated” is about source quality and scope, not a value judgment on mixture. citeturn3search12turn3search7turn3search2

**5) Language that doesn’t reproduce the old harm.**  
For 1864, say: *“Opponents deployed a race-baiting hoax (the **Miscegenation** pamphlet) and satirical tracts (e.g., **Abraham Africanus I**) to rally their own base by tying Lincoln and Republicans to interracial equality; the tactic failed nationally in November. Claims about Lincoln’s mixed ancestry remain unproven for lack of primary evidence, not because such ancestry would be discrediting.”* citeturn0search0turn1search0turn0search9

That framing keeps the political dirty trick in its box, treats ancestry as an evidentiary question (not a stigma), and acknowledges the multiracial United States that already existed—and fought—to end slavery.
