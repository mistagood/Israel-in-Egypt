# Waiakea Water Source

does waiakea water come from a tap

---



---

Waiākea water is sourced from the slopes of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, not from a municipal tap. According to the company’s official information, their water originates as snowmelt and rain, which then filters through thousands of feet of porous volcanic rock. This natural filtration process infuses the water with minerals, naturally elevating its pH and imparting its distinct taste. The final product is bottled at a facility near the source, meaning it isn’t collected or processed in the same manner as tap water.

**Confirming the water source**

The water from Waiakea is sourced from a deep well in Kea'au, Hawaii, not a municipal source. It's naturally alkaline and electrolyte-rich, sourced from Mauna Loa.

No, Waiākea’s water is not drawn from a municipal supply. The brand sources its water from a private well tapping into an aquifer near the Mauna Loa volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. This water begins as rainfall and snowmelt that naturally filters through thousands of feet of porous volcanic rock. By the time it reaches the aquifer, it’s naturally enriched with minerals and electrolytes, resulting in its signature alkalinity and taste. This source is controlled and closely monitored by the company, setting it apart from standard municipal tap water.

where are you getting this info? It seems there is controversy about the ethics of bottling Hawaii water and selling at premium prices while hawaiians dont have access to the same clean water

**Pinpointing the water source**

OK, let me see. Waiākea water is claimed to be filtered through porous volcanic rock from an "untouched source" on Mauna Loa's slopes.

**Pouring over details**

Waiākea water originates from an artesian well on private land near Mauna Loa, claiming purity and volcanic filtration. Questions are raised about water rights and its ethical implications.

**Assessing controversies**

I’m examining Waiākea water's ethical concerns, grounded in the official brand website and reputable news sources, focusing on water rights and environmental impact.

Information about Waiākea’s water source primarily comes from the company’s own marketing materials and website, where they describe their bottling process and the origins of their water as coming from volcanic filtration through porous rock near Mauna Loa. Press releases, interviews, and brand literature often repeat these points. Independent write-ups by food and beverage industry journals and consumer publications have also noted the brand’s claims of sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly packaging. 

As for the ethical controversies and criticisms, these have been discussed in various news articles, opinion pieces, and social media commentaries. Some Native Hawaiian activists, environmental advocates, and community members have expressed concerns that high-end Hawaiian-branded bottled water is being sold at a premium price on the global market, while many local communities in Hawai‘i still struggle with water accessibility and resource management issues. These criticisms can be found in local Hawaiian news outlets, environmental blogs, and consumer advocacy forums. While not always covered by major national media, smaller independent journalism platforms, regional newspapers, and community organizations have provided critical viewpoints and fielded interviews with local voices who question the fairness and sustainability of commercializing a natural resource that may not be equally accessible to all residents.

In short, pro-brand information is easily found through Waiākea’s promotional channels and beverage industry coverage, while the ethical concerns and critiques often surface in smaller news publications, advocacy group statements, and social discourse originating within local Hawaiian communities and environmental circles.
