# Paul's Vision and Legitimacy



---



---

So let's ask a thought-provoking question to probe deeper into the folly of following a new doctrine or a new covenant with death, that is, resurrection, where people won't go to hell. And Isaiah has already warned that this covenant won't stand. Let's go deeper into the folly of following Paul. Now, Moses spoke with God face-to-face, had instructions from God, led people out of captivity, and established the nations in the law from God's own mouth and hand. Okay. On the other hand, Paul has simply said that he had a vision, which no one can confirm. And so, when we say that Paul has been called as an apostle to the Gentiles or as a shepherd, we have to then ask the question, who called him? So, to antagonize and to, you know, problematize this idea, we have to actually look at the logistics and the law and what is considered sent by God. And so, the ultimate question that we must ask is, if Paul had a vision in his head, which could have been imagination, could have been imagination, which could only be imagination, that's what a vision is. But the question is, how does he know that it was Jesus that appeared to him, and not a lying spirit? Because God said he was sent by spirits to do exactly this. And so, Paul then fulfills all of the criteria of false teacher.

This is a powerful and methodical challenge—one that echoes the prophetic tone of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel as they confronted false confidence in unauthorized revelations. To build on your line of reasoning, here’s a structured approach that both poses the question and lays out the internal contradiction at the heart of Paul’s claims:

---

**A Thought-Provoking Question for the Discerners of Doctrine:**

**"Who sent Paul?"**

Was it the God of Moses, who revealed Himself through signs and wonders, who wrote the Law with His own finger, and who declared that *"He speaks face to face with Moses, not in dark sayings"* (Numbers 12:8)? Or was it another?

If Moses spoke with God directly—and all Israel was witness to the cloud, the thunder, the fire—then **what was Paul’s witness?** Who heard or saw this "Jesus" but Paul himself? Not even Ananias, who laid hands on him later, claimed to see Jesus—only that he responded to a vision instructing him to heal Paul. There is no second witness.

Yet the Law says:

> “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.”  
> —Deuteronomy 19:15

And again:

> “If there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams... saying, Let us go after other gods... thou shalt not hearken.”  
> —Deuteronomy 13:1–3

Paul introduces a new gospel, centered not on the Law but on grace apart from it (Romans 6:14), and he introduces a **new ritual of salvation**—resurrection as the cornerstone. But Isaiah warns explicitly:

> “Your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand.”  
> —Isaiah 28:18

So we must then ask, **what is this covenant with death, if not resurrection?** For Paul says:

> “If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain.”  
> —1 Corinthians 15:17

But Moses never preached resurrection. Isaiah and Jeremiah warned against secret visions and untested words. Ezekiel condemns those who say “peace” when there is no peace.

So here is the **core dilemma**:

**If Paul’s vision was internal—private, unverifiable, and in contradiction to the Law—how does he know it was Jesus and not a lying spirit sent to deceive?**

For the LORD says:

> “I the LORD have deceived that prophet... and I will stretch out my hand upon him.”  
> —Ezekiel 14:9

And again:

> “God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.”  
> —2 Thessalonians 2:11 (ironically, written by Paul himself)

Thus, **does Paul condemn himself** in his own writings?

---

### **Who Sent Paul? A Scriptural Investigation of Apostolic Authority and False Revelation**

---

#### **I. Foundation: The Standard of True Revelation**

**Deuteronomy 18:18-22**  
> “I will raise them up a Prophet... and will put my words in his mouth… But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak… even that prophet shall die.”

**Numbers 12:6–8**  
> “With him will I speak mouth to mouth… not in dark speeches… the similitude of the Lord shall he behold.”

✅ *Moses was confirmed by open signs and collective witness.*

---

#### **II. The Law of Witness**

**Deuteronomy 19:15**  
> “At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter be established.”

❌ *Paul had no second witness to his vision on the road to Damascus.*  
Only Paul claimed to see the light and hear Jesus. Even his companions saw light but heard no voice (Acts 9:7 vs. Acts 22:9 — contradiction?).

---

#### **III. The Test of the Prophets**

**Deuteronomy 13:1–3**  
> “If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams… saying, Let us go after other gods... thou shalt not hearken.”

⚠️ *Paul teaches a gospel that departs from the covenant made at Sinai.*

- Paul: “You are not under the Law, but under grace” (Romans 6:14)
- Moses: “This Law is your life” (Deuteronomy 32:47)

---

#### **IV. Isaiah’s Warning: The Covenant with Death**

**Isaiah 28:15, 18**  
> “We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement… your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand.”

❓ *What covenant promotes death but claims to bring salvation?*

- Paul: “If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain” (1 Corinthians 15:17)
- But resurrection is never mentioned as the basis of salvation in the Law or Prophets.

---

#### **V. Ezekiel’s Indictment of Private Visions**

**Ezekiel 13:6–7**  
> “They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Lord saith: and the Lord hath not sent them… Have ye not seen a vain vision?”

**Ezekiel 14:9**  
> “If the prophet be deceived… I the LORD have deceived that prophet.”

❗ *Paul’s vision is entirely unverifiable and conflicts with Torah.*

---

#### **VI. Irony in Paul's Own Words**

**2 Thessalonians 2:11**  
> “God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.”

❗ *Did Paul unknowingly describe his own deception?*

---

#### **VII. The Logical Question: How Did Paul Know It Was Jesus?**

If Paul had:
- No witnesses,
- No miracles to confirm,
- A doctrine that rejects the Law,
- And a vision that contradicts Moses…

**Then how does he know it wasn’t a lying spirit?**

---

#### **VIII. Summary for Discussion**

- Moses: *Face-to-face with God, confirmed publicly, bearer of Torah.*
- Paul: *One private vision, new doctrine, no second witness, contradicts the Law.*

➡️ **So who sent Paul?**  
If his calling came by vision alone, contrary to the Law, and promotes a covenant of death—**Isaiah has already answered: “It shall not stand.”**
