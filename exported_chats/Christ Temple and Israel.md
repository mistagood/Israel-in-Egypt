# Christ Temple and Israel



---

If God dwells in the temple, and Christ is the temple, and the church is the body of Christ, then Christ dwelling among us, means God dwelling in the temple, and God said that he would dwell among Israel. So therefore, the body of Christ is Israel.

Your line of reasoning links several biblical concepts together to assert that the body of Christ is synonymous with Israel. Let's unpack these connections step-by-step:

1. **God Dwells in the Temple**: In the Hebrew Bible, particularly in texts like Exodus and 1 Kings, God promises to dwell among the Israelites in the tabernacle and later in the temple. The temple is described as the physical place where God's presence resides among His people (1 Kings 8:27-30).

2. **Christ as the Temple**: In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of His body as a temple. When He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2:19-21), He is referring to His body. Here, the physical structure of the temple is replaced with the incarnate presence of God in Christ.

3. **The Church as the Body of Christ**: The Apostle Paul, in his letters, uses the metaphor of the church as the "body of Christ" (1 Corinthians 12:27, Ephesians 4:12). This metaphor signifies that the believers, as a collective, embody Christ's presence on Earth. The idea is that Christ's spirit dwells within the members of His church, and they function as His hands and feet.

4. **Christ Dwelling Among Us Equals God Dwelling in the Temple**: If Christ is the temple (the dwelling place of God) and the church is His body, then through the church, Christ dwells among us. Consequently, wherever the church exists, God's presence—through Christ—exists there as well.

5. **God Dwelling Among Israel**: In the Old Testament, God's promise to dwell among His people, Israel, is foundational (Leviticus 26:11-12, Ezekiel 37:27). Israel is the nation chosen by God, His covenant people.

6. **Conclusion: The Body of Christ is Israel**: If the church is the body of Christ, and Christ's presence signifies God's dwelling, then the argument posits that the church represents Israel. The church, in this interpretation, is seen as the spiritual continuation or fulfillment of Israel, composed of those who are grafted into the covenant community (Romans 11).

In essence, this reasoning hinges on the spiritual interpretation of Israel not as a geographical or purely ethnic entity but as the people of God who embody His presence on Earth. It emphasizes the continuity between the Old and New Testament covenants, seeing the church not as a replacement but as an extension or fulfillment of God's promise to dwell among His people. The body of Christ—spanning Jew and Gentile believers—is thus identified as "Israel" in this spiritual and covenantal sense.

Well, more specifically, the Bible describes who Israel is, so we have to go with the biblical description of Israel, and this is Ephraim as the head of Israel, and Ephraim will be joined to Judah, and the Israelites with them will be one stick in the hand of Joseph. So, specifically, Joseph will be the resurrection of Israel, who will be raised up as demonstrated through Ezekiel 37. So these people will be the body of Christ that is raised up.

Your interpretation draws from several prophetic and covenantal themes in the Bible, particularly focusing on the role of Ephraim and Joseph in the resurrection and reunification of Israel. Let's break down this understanding:

1. **Biblical Description of Israel**: You are right to emphasize that the Bible provides a specific description of Israel's identity, particularly in the prophetic writings. Israel is not just a monolithic entity but often represented by various tribes and leaders, with Ephraim playing a prominent role.

2. **Ephraim as the Head of Israel**: Ephraim, the son of Joseph, is frequently depicted in the Hebrew Bible as a leader among the tribes of Israel. In Hosea and other prophetic books, Ephraim is often used to symbolize the Northern Kingdom, sometimes even standing for the entirety of Israel. This aligns with your understanding that Ephraim is seen as a representative or 'head' of Israel.

3. **Reunion with Judah**: The prophecy in Ezekiel 37 speaks to the reunification of the divided kingdoms of Israel (Ephraim) and Judah. Ezekiel is instructed to take two sticks—one representing Judah and the Israelites associated with him, and the other representing Ephraim and the tribes associated with Joseph—and join them together as one stick in his hand (Ezekiel 37:16-19). This symbolizes the future unity of all the tribes under one leadership, a restoration of Israel as a single, unified people.

4. **The Role of Joseph and the Resurrection of Israel**: You highlight Joseph's central role in this resurrection narrative. The vision of the dry bones in Ezekiel 37 symbolizes the house of Israel in a state of death and exile. Yet, God promises to breathe life into these bones, resurrecting them as a great army. This resurrection is not merely physical but represents the spiritual revival and restoration of Israel. 

   The "stick of Joseph" joining with Judah further implies that this restoration will not only involve a return from physical exile but also a reunification of the once-divided kingdom. This is often interpreted as a Messianic prophecy that some believe will be fulfilled in a future spiritual or physical resurrection of Israel.

5. **The Body of Christ as the Resurrected Israel**: If Joseph (Ephraim) represents the resurrection of Israel, and Israel is metaphorically raised up from death as described in Ezekiel 37, then the body of Christ, composed of those grafted into this resurrected Israel, can be understood as those brought to new life. 

   In this sense, the body of Christ is not a separate entity from Israel but rather its fulfillment—the resurrected, unified Israel brought together under one King. It aligns with the prophetic vision that the Messiah (often connected with the line of David/Judah) would reign over a unified and restored people, symbolized by the "one stick" in the hand of Joseph.

6. **Conclusion**: According to this interpretation, the body of Christ is the resurrected Israel, specifically tied to the prophecy of Joseph and Ephraim. The spiritual resurrection of Israel, as prophesied in Ezekiel, is not only the literal gathering of the dispersed tribes but also their transformation into a new covenant community. The church, then, becomes this resurrected body of Israel, fulfilling the prophetic visions of unity, restoration, and resurrection found in the Old Testament. This view sees the body of Christ and Israel as inherently interconnected, with Christ as the unifying King who brings the divided tribes back together as one.
