# Skipping the 13th Floor

Why don't builders put a 13th floor in buildings?

Builders often omit the 13th floor in buildings due to superstition and the widespread belief that the number 13 is unlucky. This superstition, known as triskaidekaphobia, stems from various historical, cultural, and religious sources that associate the number 13 with bad luck. As a result, many developers and property owners skip numbering the 13th floor to avoid potential tenant or buyer concerns and ensure higher occupancy rates. Instead, they often label the floor as 14 or use another designation to maintain a more marketable and appealing property.
