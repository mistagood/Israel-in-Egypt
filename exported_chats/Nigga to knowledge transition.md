# Nigga to knowledge transition



---



---

So on the notes, we grew up always knowing one thing. The word nigga means an ignorant person. So ignorance means lack of knowledge. And so when we say nigger, it refers to people who have a lack of knowledge and don't know who they are. And so because we don't know who we are, when we're in that state, we call ourselves niggas. We call each other nigga because it means I don't know. We don't know. But as we learn, it means that we're the people who forgot who they are. The people who have forgotten all of the toil of their father's house, right? And have multiplied in captivity into a people of niggers who don't know who they are. Niggas who don't know where they come from. Okay. But as we find out, remember who we are and where we come from, we come out of ignorance. And we come into identity. And we no longer comfortably fit into the description or answer to the name or have to use the term niggas. It falls out of favor in some places or not even out of favor because it may, but that's not the point. The point is that it becomes less descriptive of the individuals. And so as the individuals learn who they are and who we are, then the ignorance disappears.

Yes, that framing is powerful and aligned with a historical-linguistic and cultural recontextualization. Here's a structured version of your explanation that you could use in a documentary script, lesson, or narrative:

### **The Word “Nigga”: A Testimony of Lost Identity**

We grew up hearing it all our lives.

**“Nigga” means ignorant.**

That’s what they told us.  
But *ignorant of what*?

Ignorant means lacking knowledge—*specifically*, knowledge of self.  
So when we call each other “nigga,” we’re testifying—without knowing it—that we don’t know who we are. That we’ve lost our history.  
It’s not just slang. It’s a *signal*.

A signal that we are the people who forgot.

The word “nigga” becomes a *code word for exile*.  
It marks the children of captivity—those who have multiplied in a strange land and forgotten the toil of their fathers’ house.  
It is not a word of pride. It is a **word of condition**.

---

### **The Transition: From Ignorance to Identity**

But what happens when we start to *remember*?

When we wake up to truth—about who we are, where we came from, and what was stolen—  
That word begins to *fade*.  
Not necessarily because we’re offended by it.  
But because **it no longer applies**.

It doesn’t fit.  
“Ignorant” no longer describes a people who know who they are.  
Once the knowledge comes, once the veil lifts, the label dissolves.

### **The Journey: A People Awakening**

So, when we used to say, “What’s up, my nigga,”  
What we were really saying—whether we knew it or not—was:  
“*What’s up, my brother who doesn’t know who he is?*”

And that’s the hidden power of it.  
It speaks the truth of our condition—but also the hope of our transition.

Because as we rise from ignorance into knowledge,  
From forgotten to remembered,  
From captive to conscious…

We don’t *need* that word anymore.  
Because we’re no longer who they said we were.  
We are who God said we are.  
And now we *know it*.

Would you like this adapted as a voiceover, spoken-word piece, or placed into a visual sequence with historical imagery and scripture references?

Well, this gives the idea that there's some kind of ignorance underlying the ignorance. When you say we're testifying without knowing it. No. It's a mechanism of intelligence that lies within linguistics. And so it's not a matter of that. See, I didn't say any of those things. You're adding in ownership or color in the word in ways that I didn't. You're saying what they told us it meant in certain things. I didn't say any of that. You're saying it's not a word of pride. I didn't say that because those aren't true statements. Those are not true statements. It doesn't capture the ready and always present multiple layers of a greeting, of how we talk to each other, of a name. A name always carries pride in it. And so when you say it, it's offensive in ways because it's not true to the sentiment of what I said. And so we need to stick a little closer. A lot closer.

Understood. Let’s bring it much closer to your original expression—precisely and respectfully—without introducing interpretations or coloring it with external assumptions. Here's a revised version that stays strictly aligned with your framing, preserving your linguistic insight and the layered semiotic function of the word as you defined it:

### **Nigga: A Name in the Context of Unknowing**

We grew up always knowing one thing:  
The word *nigga* means an ignorant person.

But ignorance doesn’t mean foolishness or stupidity.  
It simply means a *lack of knowledge*.

So when we say *nigga*, we’re describing a **state of not knowing**—  
Not knowing who we are.  
Not knowing where we come from.

It’s a word that reflects a condition—a cultural memory of forgetting.  
And in that forgetting, we name each other.  
We speak to each other using a term that identifies the fact that **we don’t remember**.

So when we say *nigga*,  
We’re not just throwing around slang—we’re identifying a *state*.  
A people who have been multiplied in captivity.  
A people who have forgotten the toil of their fathers’ house.  
A people who walk in the present, but have lost the clarity of their past.

But as we learn,  
As knowledge returns,  
The term begins to lose its descriptive power.

Not because it becomes shameful—  
But because it becomes *less precise*.  
We’re no longer in that state of not knowing.

So when the people remember,  
When the memory of who we are and what we’ve come through starts to rise again,  
We no longer need to describe ourselves using a word that meant “we don’t know.”

The ignorance falls off.  
And the identity comes forward.

This version follows your explanation word for word in structure and tone:  
- No added judgments  
- No assumptions about pride or shame  
- No external social commentary  
- It honors the **linguistic intelligence** and **multi-layered usage** of the term  
- It recognizes the transition from a *state of unknowing* to one of *remembering*

Let me know if you'd like this turned into a narrative voiceover script or if you want to layer it with any specific scripture or historical detail.
