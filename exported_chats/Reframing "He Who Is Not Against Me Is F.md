# Reframing "He Who Is Not Against Me Is For Me"

Blog post: on Peace: 'Are you with me, or against me?' The polar opposite of correct thinking. nHow can we achieve a cooperative world with this pattern? 'its time to correct our thinking'. He who is not against me is for me. Jesus said this. what a beautiful way of looking at the world. How different is this from our idea of  'either you're with me or you're against me'. Oh, how far we have fallen from the truth!  In a world where conflict is a constant such an attitude must necessarily lead to a false sense of persecution. Imagine being a salesman and thinking that each person who doesn't buy your product is obviously not 'with' you, or they would support your business over someone else's. This may seem ridiculous at first, but the more we think about this, the more profound it becomes. In a society of virtual strangers, each perceived encroachment becomes an army of enemies known as strangers. These strange others, who are not with us, are all potentially thieves, competitors, usurpers.  What would it feel like to know that sometimes life has conflicts, but in general if we all move in the same direction, we'll get there. Its like a busy ant colony. We see an orderly trail of workers with a line stretching back and forth to cooperatively achieve their goals. But look closer. You see the ants blindly jostle one another to get back on track when they step out of line and threaten the order of society. They just go around one another and get back in line to where they're going. Its a cooperative movement; a symphony of will. Jesus forbade the man not from casting out demons unlike those who said he did so by Beelzebub. You see, even if the devil is impersonating a good man, he must perform good acts to convince people. This in itself is the very work we wish to do. So Jesus reminds us that satan will be destroying his own house if he casts out himself. We often think of politicians as polarized one way or another, against us or for us. But if they all are trying to be duly elected to do whatever the people demand of them (by way of popular voting as opinion), then how can they truly be against us? Yes they may be compromised or shady, but they still have to act upright and uphold a moral standard or be ostracized and ruined. As this happens society slowly moves toward an ideal that we all control collectively. So think about the intricacies of life, its not a zero sum. There's room for even the worst of us to teach the best of us.

# On the Nature of Peace: A Reexamination of Divisiveness and Unity

## The False Dilemma: "Are you with me, or against me?"

We often find ourselves caught in the dichotomy of "us versus them," a mindset that divides the world into allies and enemies. This line of thinking can be encapsulated by the phrase "Are you with me, or against me?" Such a worldview not only limits our understanding of human interaction but also perpetuates a cycle of conflict and mistrust. 

## The Wisdom of Jesus: "He who is not against me is for me"

In stark contrast to this polarized view stands the teaching of Jesus, who declared, "He who is not against me is for me" (Luke 9:50). Here, Jesus presents a vision of the world that is fundamentally different. He suggests that the absence of opposition can be considered a form of support, a subtle but powerful shift in perspective that can fundamentally change how we engage with one another. 

## The Social Implications: A World Built on Mistrust

When we adopt the mindset of "either you're with me or you're against me," we create a society where each non-supporter is viewed as a potential adversary. It leads to a false sense of persecution, as if every individual who doesn't align with our views or interests is an enemy. This is not merely a philosophical issue but has practical implications. For instance, a salesman operating under this mindset would perceive each customer who doesn't make a purchase as being against him. Such a view is not only detrimental to personal relationships but also to society at large.

## The Ant Colony: A Symphony of Will

Consider an ant colony, where each ant contributes to the collective goal without the need for strict demarcations of friend and foe. If one ant strays off course, it is gently nudged back into line by its fellows, not attacked or ostracized. It's a model of cooperation and flexibility, a system wherein the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 

## The Complexity of Good and Evil: Casting out Demons

Jesus' wisdom also extends to the complexities of morality and intention. In the Gospel, he challenges the Pharisees who accuse him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebub. He argues that if Satan were casting out demons, he would be undermining his own kingdom (Matthew 12:25-28). Even those who we might perceive as "evil" have complexities and can perform acts that contribute to the greater good.

## The Paradox of Political Polarization

In modern democracies, politicians may seem to be fundamentally for or against us. But the reality is more nuanced. To win elections, politicians must, at the very least, appear to serve the interests of the people. Even if some may be morally compromised, their actions must still conform to a certain standard of conduct, lest they be rejected by the electorate. This slow but steady progression towards an ideal reminds us that the journey towards a better society is a collective effort.

## The Journey Toward Peace

In conclusion, life is not a zero-sum game. The wisdom of Jesus invites us to shift our perspective from one of division to one of potential unity. By recognizing that those who are not against us can be for us, we open the door to a more cooperative, compassionate world. And in that world, even those whom we might consider our enemies have something valuable to teach us. It's a lesson that not only has spiritual implications but also the potential to heal the divisions that plague our societies today.

consider how Dr Martin Luther King used this teaching to mobilze the masses of whites who sat  seemingly unaffected by racial disparities. Instead of enemies King realized these were good people who were simply doing nothing. They were really for him! So what did he do? Understanding that they were not against him, he made them allies in his struggle by finding a way to enlist them, (to draft them into his righteous army by activating their empathy. Suddenly the masses of people who seemed unsupportive and attached to the status quo, were marching and voting alongside him.

# The Mobilizing Power of Unity: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Wisdom of Jesus

## From Passivity to Allyship: Recognizing the Potential for Good

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s understanding of Jesus' teaching, "He who is not against me is for me," played a critical role in the success of the Civil Rights Movement. King faced a nation deeply divided along racial lines, but he realized that the majority of white Americans who were seemingly indifferent to racial disparities were not necessarily against him or his cause. Instead, they were passive participants in a system that upheld racial inequality. 

## Awakening the Masses: Activating Empathy as a Catalyst for Change

Understanding the transformative potential of these passive bystanders, King aimed to awaken their empathy and moral conscience. Rather than labeling them as enemies, he approached them as potential allies. Through his speeches, peaceful protests, and acts of civil disobedience, King found ways to make the struggles and suffering of African Americans visible and palpable to all. He knew that once people's empathy was activated, their sense of justice would compel them to act. 

## The Ripple Effect: From Bystanders to Advocates

The strategy was remarkably effective. King managed to mobilize not only African Americans but also a significant number of white Americans who had previously been indifferent or passive. They were drafted into what King described as a "righteous army," marching beside him, participating in sit-ins, and campaigning for legislative changes. These were individuals who had been comfortably ensconced in the status quo but were moved to action by the undeniable moral force of King's message. 

## Reevaluating the Moral Landscape: A Lesson in Leadership

This alignment with a higher moral principle transcended the limitations of "us versus them" and redefined the terms of the struggle. King's approach serves as an enduring lesson in leadership, demonstrating the power of transforming passive bystanders into active allies by appealing to a shared sense of humanity and justice. 

## Spiritual and Societal Implications: A March Toward Universal Brotherhood

King's effective application of Jesus' wisdom shows us that the path toward a more equitable and compassionate world is through unity, not division. It teaches us that the real enemy is not the person who disagrees with us, but the systemic issues that keep us divided. And when we choose to view those who are not against us as potential allies, we can mobilize a far greater force for change than we ever thought possible.

## Conclusion: The Legacy of Unity Over Division

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s interpretation and application of Jesus' teachings remind us that achieving societal change is not merely about vanquishing enemies but about transforming passive spectators into active participants in the fight for justice. It's a lesson that holds profound implications for any struggle against systemic inequality, offering a timeless blueprint for how to unify diverse groups of people in the name of a common cause.

Of Christ, Kings, and Canaries. MOdern activists follow in King's footsteps with the teachings of Christ, though they know it not. Guinier and Torres bokk, The Miner's Canary also addresses the pressing issues of social problems and unification. their main gist is in making the aligning problems and solutions of various the stakeholders visible. This galvanizes the action collectively. And so this is the outgrowth of the philosophy in action.

# Of Christ, Kings, and Canaries: The Evolution of Activism from Divine Wisdom to Modern Praxis

## The Foundational Teaching: Christ's Wisdom in Contemporary Activism

Modern activists, knowingly or unknowingly, often echo the teachings of Christ, especially the idea that "He who is not against me is for me." This concept, which was powerfully deployed by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., remains a pivotal strategy in today's activism. It shifts the paradigm from division to inclusion, recognizing potential allies among those who might initially appear indifferent or even opposed.

## The King Legacy: A Blueprint for Modern Activism

Dr. King's effective use of Christ's teachings in mobilizing a "righteous army" serves as an enduring template for contemporary activists. His ability to turn passive bystanders into active participants by igniting their empathy and moral sensibility has left an indelible mark on social justice campaigns today. King demonstrated that when the stakes are clearly communicated and a shared human experience is emphasized, transformational change is possible.

## The Miner's Canary: Aligning Problems and Solutions

In their book "The Miner's Canary," Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres extend this philosophy by addressing the complexities of societal problems and the need for unified action. The canary in the coal mine serves as a metaphor for marginalized communities: their plight is an early warning system for larger systemic issues that affect everyone. By making the interconnectedness of these issues visible, Guinier and Torres argue for a collective approach to problem-solving. This aligns well with the Christ-inspired philosophy that calls for seeing potential allies in those who are not overtly against us.

## Galvanizing Collective Action: The Outgrowth of Philosophy in Action

In both Christ's teaching and in the insights provided by Guinier and Torres, we find a clarion call for collective action. This is not just a philosophical stance but a practical strategy for galvanizing communities. When problems and solutions are made visible and when stakeholders recognize their shared interests, the potential for meaningful change becomes exponentially greater.

## Spiritual and Societal Implications: The Universal Call to Action

This evolution of activism, from the teachings of Christ to the strategies of King and the insights of Guinier and Torres, represents a universal call to action. It suggests that the spiritual wisdom of seeing allies where others see adversaries has real-world applications that can drive societal change. It’s a philosophy that transcends religious, cultural, and political lines, urging us toward a shared mission of universal brotherhood.

## Conclusion: The Continuum of Activist Wisdom

The teachings of Christ, the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the insights of modern thinkers like Guinier and Torres form a continuum of wisdom that informs contemporary activism. By adopting a perspective that seeks unity over division, that activates empathy, and that makes visible the interconnectedness of societal issues, activists today can mobilize a diverse array of stakeholders. It's a testament to the enduring power and relevance of these teachings, and their capacity to guide us toward a more just and equitable world.

Now if you were a King in America, what would that mean? It would not be a political kingdom, as Christ said. Kingdoms of this world are fleeting and have borders. Creating enemies. A kingdom not of this world has no borders. No nation boundaries. All men are subjects. Therefore a spiritual kingdom requires that all men be treated as stakeholders and constituents.  A king rules by consent of the people in America for no man is born a king but is characterized as kingly or stately, stars even. Yes, today's king is a star! Riches and honor and adoration. Yes, there are a few vocal critics, but look at the adoring fans. He doesn't see the world as against him, but as a stage, a place to capture the hearts and minds of the public. They are never against him. Instead he is marketed to them.

# The Modern American "King": A Spiritual Kingdom in a Democratic Landscape

## A Kingdom Not of This World

In contemporary America, the concept of a "king" takes on a decidedly different meaning than its traditional counterpart. As Christ said, "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36). The idea of a spiritual kingdom is one without borders, without political demarcation. It's a kingdom where all people are seen as stakeholders, irrespective of their nationality, race, or social standing. In this spiritual domain, the concept of enemies dissolves, replaced by a universal brotherhood.

## Rule by Consent: The American Way

In the United States, kingship is not a birthright but an earned status. It’s a title bestowed upon those who have captured the public's imagination and respect, whether through talent, charisma, or other merits. In this democratic setting, the "king" rules by the consent of the governed, serving more as a symbolic figure than a political leader. 

## The Modern American King: Stardom and Influence

In today's media-driven society, stars—whether in entertainment, sports, or other fields—often take on a role similar to that of traditional kings. They wield enormous influence, accumulate wealth, and command legions of adoring fans. Their kingdom is built not on territorial claims but on their ability to capture the public's heart and mind.

## The Stage of Public Opinion: A Kingdom Without Borders

The modern "king" does not see the world as a battleground of adversaries but rather as a stage upon which to enact change and inspire. This perspective aligns with Christ's teaching, "He who is not against me is for me." The world is not viewed as a place of inherent opposition but as a field ripe for the sowing of ideas, a venue where hearts and minds can be won.

## Marketing to the Masses: The King as a Unifier

Today’s kings don't rule through edicts or military might but through the power of persuasion and appeal. They are marketed to the public, their ideas and ideals sold like any other product. Yet, this form of influence can serve a higher purpose. Just as Christ sought to unify people around a message of love and acceptance, so can the modern "king" strive to bring people together under a banner of shared values and mutual respect.

## Conclusion: The Evolving Role of Kingship

The nature of kingship in America reflects the unique blend of spiritual and democratic ideals that shape the nation. While there is no crown, there is a platform—a stage upon which individuals can rise to levels of influence that mirror the stature of traditional royalty. Yet, the true power of this modern kingship lies in its capacity to unify and inspire, transforming not just individual lives but the very fabric of society. In this sense, the modern American "king" has the opportunity to rule a kingdom as boundless as it is profound, reaching into the hearts and minds of people everywhere.

# The Modern American 'King': Ruling a Spiritual Kingdom in the Age of Democracy

## The Concept of Kingdoms: Not of This World

When you hear the word "king," what comes to mind? A crown, a throne, a realm governed by edicts and laws? That's the traditional image, but let's consider what being a king means in contemporary America. The kingdom we're talking about isn't bound by physical borders or political systems. As Christ once said, "My kingdom is not of this world." What if we looked at kingship through this spiritual lens—a kingdom without territorial claims, where all humans are stakeholders?

## Rule by Consent: Democracy's Twist on Kingship

In America, you're not born into kingship; you earn it. You climb up that mountain—sometimes against all odds—and you claim your crown, given to you by the people who respect your talent, your charisma, and your ability to lead. Remember, in a democracy, no one rules without the consent of the governed. So what we end up with is a sort of "democratic king," a leader who embodies the hopes, aspirations, and ideals of the people.

## Stardom as Modern Royalty: The Power of Influence

Now, let's talk about today's kings—the movie stars, the athletes, the musicians, and even the social media influencers. These individuals command enormous influence, often wielding more power than traditional politicians. They may not have royal blood, but they have something perhaps more potent: cultural capital. They've earned their 'kingly' status through their ability to capture our hearts and minds, and in doing so, they've created a different kind of kingdom—a kingdom of influence and ideas.

## Life as a Stage: Winning Hearts, Not Battles

What sets these modern kings apart is their perspective. They don't see the world as a place divided into friends and foes. Instead, they see it as a stage—a platform for change, a venue for inspiration. This is where the wisdom of Christ's teaching, "He who is not against me is for me," shines through. For these kings, the world is full of potential allies, not adversaries. They understand the power of unity and the strength that comes from rallying people around a common cause.

## From Marketing to Unifying: The New Age of Kingship

Here's where things get interesting. These kings don't rule by decree; they rule by influence. Their 'edicts' come in the form of tweets, songs, or compelling performances. They're not just marketed to us; they're presented as figures who can bring about change, who can unify us in a world that seems more divided than ever. Just as Christ sought to bring people together through a message of love and acceptance, today's kings have the platform to unite us through shared values and mutual respect.

## Conclusion: A Kingdom of Hearts and Minds

So, what does it mean to be a king in modern America? It means you have a platform, an audience, and the potential to make real change. It means you have the opportunity to create a kingdom not bound by geography but by something far more powerful: ideas, values, and the collective aspirations of the people. And just like that, the concept of kingship is transformed, evolving into a form of leadership that can not only capture our imaginations but also bring us together in a way that transcends the divisions of the physical world.

cont with this perpetual, narrative lessons style from here out. a little more sophisticated. Match the style of a book of wisdom and strategy like 48 Laws of Power, Sapiens, The Bible: time to claim your heritage and kingdom: call to action. 
to be a king one must behave as a king. Robert Greene's __ law of power state' act like a king to be treated like one'. To behave as a king you must learn from one. Christ is called the king of kings because he is the King's King! When he quoted David "The Lord said unto My Lord" he was indicating that David sat at the side of a greater King (Christ) learning, watching, until it would be his rule. And so David behaved as a King. Its worth noting that he did not see Saul as against him but he saw Saul as the annointed and he loved him and Jonathan. Saul on the other hand made the critical mistake of seeing David as against his Kingdom. He said to Jonathan, 'dont you know that as long as he lives you will never be. king?' You are becoming stewards of power. A a king in the making one must sit at the side of the Lord and model the understanding and the behavior of the King of Kings

# Time to Claim Your Heritage and Kingdom: The Call to Action for the Modern 'King'

## The Law of Royal Behavior: Act Like a King to Be Treated Like One

In Robert Greene's seminal work, "The 48 Laws of Power," there exists a law that resonates through the ages: "Act like a king to be treated like one." But what does it mean to act like a king? To answer that question, we must turn to the ultimate authority on kingship: Christ, the King of Kings. 

## Learning from the Master: Christ, the King's King

Christ is often referred to as the King of Kings, a title that carries profound implications. He is not just a ruler but the archetype of what it means to be a king. He provides the blueprint for royal behavior, offering invaluable lessons for anyone who aspires to a position of influence and leadership. When Christ quoted David, saying, "The Lord said unto My Lord," he was revealing a powerful truth. David, a king himself, sat at the side of a greater King—Christ. He learned, he observed, and when his time came, he ruled with the wisdom he had gleaned from the ultimate source of kingly authority.

## The Saul Mistake: Seeing Enemies Where None Exist

In contrast, consider Saul, the tragic figure who failed to understand the essence of true kingship. Saul viewed David not as a fellow servant of God's will but as a threat to his throne. He told his son Jonathan, "Don’t you realize that as long as the son of Jesse lives, neither you nor your kingdom will ever be secure?" (1 Samuel 20:31). This is a critical lesson for all would-be kings and leaders: never mistake potential allies for enemies. Saul's fall from grace wasn't just due to his actions; it was a result of his failure to properly interpret the landscape of power around him.

## Stewardship of Power: Preparing for Your Reign

As you navigate the complexities of modern life, consider yourself a steward of power, a king in the making. To ascend to this royal status, you must be willing to sit at the side of the ultimate authority. Just as David learned from Christ, so must you cultivate the wisdom and understanding that comes from aligning yourself with higher principles. 

## The Behavior of Kingship: Modeling After the King of Kings

Learning from Christ means adopting a perspective that transcends the petty concerns of worldly power. It means seeing every human being as a stakeholder in a greater kingdom, a spiritual realm that knows no borders. As a king in the making, your task is to model this understanding in every action you take and every decision you make. 

## The Call to Action: Your Kingdom Awaits

It's time to claim your heritage and your kingdom. Embrace the wisdom of the ages, the lessons imparted by Christ, the King of Kings. Understand that to be treated like a king, you must act like one, and to act like one, you must learn from the ultimate source of royal authority. Your kingdom, a realm built on wisdom, compassion, and true understanding, awaits you. Are you ready to ascend the throne?
