# Types of Melanin



---

What are the different colors of melanin that exist?

Melanin exists in **three primary types**, each with its own **distinct color** and function in the body. These types contribute to the wide range of pigmentation seen in human skin, hair, and eyes — and they also play roles in protection from UV radiation, oxidative stress, and possibly neural function.

### 1. **Eumelanin (Black and Brown Melanin)**
- **Color:** Deep brown to black.
- **Subtypes:**
  - **Black eumelanin**: Gives hair and skin a dark brown to black appearance.
  - **Brown eumelanin**: Lighter than black, contributes to medium-brown tones.
- **Function:** Provides strong **protection against UV radiation**. More abundant eumelanin is associated with darker skin tones and lower rates of skin cancer.

### 2. **Pheomelanin (Red and Yellow Melanin)**
- **Color:** Reddish to yellow.
- **Function:** Found in people with **red or blonde hair**, **lighter skin**, and **freckles**. It offers **less UV protection** than eumelanin and can contribute to **UV-induced oxidative stress** (due to sulfur content).
- **Chemical Composition:** Contains **benzothiazine** units and **sulfur**, distinguishing it chemically from eumelanin.

### 3. **Neuromelanin (Dark Brown to Black Pigment in the Brain)**
- **Color:** Dark brown to black (similar to eumelanin in appearance but structurally different).
- **Location:** Found in the **substantia nigra** and **locus coeruleus** regions of the brain.
- **Function:** Its full role is not completely understood, but it may help in **neuroprotection**, **metal ion binding**, and **oxidative stress regulation**.
- **Note:** Loss of neuromelanin-producing cells is associated with **Parkinson’s disease**.

### Summary Table

| Melanin Type   | Color Range      | Location                             | Function                                      |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Eumelanin      | Brown to black   | Skin, hair, eyes                     | UV protection, antioxidant                    |
| Pheomelanin    | Red to yellow    | Skin, hair (especially red/blonde)  | Less UV protection, contributes to freckles   |
| Neuromelanin   | Dark brown/black | Brain (substantia nigra, etc.)      | May protect neurons from oxidative damage     |
