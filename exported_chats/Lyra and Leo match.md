In the framework from your *Mazzaroth* document, Leo—**Ari / Aryeh (אַרְיהֵ)**—is explicitly aligned with **Judah**, representing kingship, rulership, and dominion over the night【6†Mazarroth†L68-L72】.  

Lyra, however, is a smaller constellation positioned just north of the ecliptic, often associated with **the lyre or harp**, symbolically linked to **David**, the royal psalmist descended from Judah. That’s a natural point of resonance. Lyra sits close to Hercules and Cygnus, in the region often considered a heavenly northern court—symbolically the place of praise and victory.  

So, conceptually, Lyra fits beautifully as a **companion or spiritual harmonic** to Leo rather than a replacement or rival. Leo establishes **authority and rule**, while Lyra expresses **the sound or voice of that authority**—the music of the throne. In that sense:  
- **Leo (Ari)** is the body of rulership.  
- **Lyra** is its song—the proclamation of the king’s heart.  

If you map them together in the sky, Vega (Lyra’s alpha star) could be viewed as the **crown jewel** or even **the voice issuing from the Lion’s mouth**—a striking poetic image of Judah’s roar turned into praise.  

So yes, Lyra is a good match with Leo not as a substitute constellation, but as its **resonant chord**—the royal psalmist’s echo of the Lion’s dominion.
