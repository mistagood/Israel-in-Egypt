isaiah chapter 53. we'll start with verse 1. Isaiah laments that the hidden nature of the event will keep almost all from believing. The arm of the Lord refers to the unfolding mystery that is salvation. Would anyone believe that Judas would be the Sin Goat that was a part of salvation all along? But he has been villified, as Christ said The son of man must go but woe unto that man by which... it would be better for him had he never been born. Psalm 41 also describes the condition of this despised disciple.

Certainly, let's delve into Isaiah 53:1 and provide a side-by-side commentary that aligns with the perspective you've provided. 

**Isaiah 53:1 (ESV)**
> "Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?"

**Commentary:**
The lamentation of Isaiah in this verse captures the essence of a profound mystery that has been hidden from the masses. The "arm of the LORD" is a symbolic representation of the divine plan of salvation, which remains concealed to many. This salvation is not just about the overt acts of redemption but also encompasses the hidden intricacies that play a pivotal role in the grand narrative.

The question posed, "Who has believed what he has heard from us?" underscores the incredulity that many might feel towards the unconventional interpretation of the events surrounding the crucifixion. The traditional narrative has long vilified Judas, painting him as the ultimate betrayer. However, when viewed through the lens of the scapegoat and sin offering, a different picture emerges. Judas, rather than being the antagonist, becomes an integral part of the divine plan, fulfilling a role that was predestined for him.

This perspective is further echoed in Psalm 41, which describes the plight of one who is despised and rejected, much like Judas. The words of Christ, "The son of man must go, but woe unto that man by which... it would be better for him had he never been born," can be seen not just as a condemnation but also as a lament for the heavy burden that Judas had to bear. In this light, Judas's role is not one of treachery but of sacrifice, making him a pivotal figure in the cosmic plan of salvation.

The traditional interpretations have often missed the depth and nuance of these events, focusing solely on the surface narrative. However, when one delves deeper, guided by the words of Jesus, Moses, and the prophets, a more intricate and profound understanding emerges. The events of the crucifixion and the roles played by Jesus and Judas are not just historical occurrences but are imbued with cosmic significance, revealing the multifaceted nature of divine salvation.
