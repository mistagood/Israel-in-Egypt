# Exam Delay Request.

Prepare an email for Aimee at my school and the administration. She asked me for a letter explaining a little bit more about why I want to take the qualifying exams in spring instead of last winter. Explain that given the circumstances I’m dealing with with caring for family members, it was very difficult for me too refocus in on the exam. I had taken the exam in winter before and that was actually the reason why I needed to retake it because I didn’t have time to devote more time to it at that time. It would also give me more time to  Reconnect with OAS

Subject: Request to Take Qualifying Exams in Spring

Dear Aimee and the Administration Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide a bit more context regarding my request to take the qualifying exams in the upcoming spring session rather than the previous winter.

During the last winter session, when I initially attempted the qualifying exams, I was concurrently managing significant personal responsibilities, particularly caring for family members. This situation considerably impacted my ability to prepare for and focus on the exams, which, regrettably, affected my performance.

Taking the exams under those circumstances did not allow me to dedicate the necessary time and effort to achieve a result reflective of my true capabilities. It was a challenging period, and my divided attention inevitably led to the need for a retake.

Requesting to sit for the exams in spring is a decision I've made to ensure I can fully commit to preparing adequately. The additional time will not only enable me to concentrate more effectively on my studies but also to reconnect with the Office of Academic Support (OAS). This connection is crucial for me to access the resources and support needed to optimize my preparation and performance.

I am committed to achieving a better outcome and am confident that with the extra time to prepare and the support from OAS, I will be able to demonstrate my true abilities and knowledge in the exams.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am eager to move forward with a stronger foundation and a focused mindset. I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter.

Warm regards,

This is good, but let’s modify it. I was having some reservations with retaking the exam given the problems I had last time with communicating with my advisor, and I wanted to speak with some other professors and get some more support which really help me to make the decision to go back in and take the exam and two continue with the program.

Subject: Clarification and Request Regarding Spring Qualifying Exams

Dear Aimee and the Administration Team,

I hope you are all doing well. I am writing to further clarify my request to take the qualifying exams in the upcoming spring session, providing additional insight into my decision-making process.

My previous attempt to take the exams during the last winter session was marred by significant personal challenges, notably the responsibility of caring for family members, which greatly impacted my concentration and study time. This, coupled with some communication hurdles with my advisor, led to a less than satisfactory performance on the exams.

Given these circumstances, I harbored reservations about retaking the exam and continuing in the program. It was imperative for me to reassess my situation and seek additional perspectives. To this end, I reached out and spoke with several other professors, seeking advice and support. These discussions were incredibly beneficial; they not only provided me with new insights and strategies for exam preparation but also reaffirmed my commitment to my academic goals.

The decision to request a delay for the exam until spring is born out of a desire to fully prepare myself, ensuring that I can dedicate the necessary time and effort to achieve a result that truly reflects my capabilities. This additional time will also allow me to strengthen my communication with my advisor and build a more robust support network with other faculty members, which I believe is crucial for my success.

I am confident that with this extended preparation time, coupled with the enhanced support and guidance from the faculty, I will be able to approach the qualifying exams with the focus and readiness required to excel.

Thank you very much for your understanding and for considering my request. I am eager to approach this challenge with a renewed sense of purpose and support.

Warm regards,
