# Justice and Jesus' Sacrifice



---

If God said that every man would die for his own sin, or that the sins of the Father would not be charged to the Son, and that the man that commits sin is the man that would die from now on, who gave permission for another man to die for another man's sins in the Bible then? Because if Jesus died for anyone else's sins, then it means that another man can die in place of another's sins, which doesn't seem quite fair at all. And God is a just God, so who gave permission for an innocent man to die in place of a guilty man?

Your question strikes at the heart of a tension within the biblical narrative regarding justice and atonement. Indeed, the Hebrew Scriptures do emphasize personal accountability for sin. In places like *Deuteronomy 24:16* and *Ezekiel 18:20*, the principle is clear: "The soul that sins shall die," and sons shall not be punished for the sins of their fathers. God establishes a foundational principle of personal responsibility, wherein each person bears the consequences of their actions.

Yet, the New Testament presents Jesus as a sacrificial figure who "bears the sins of the world," a concept that seems to stand in contrast to this established justice. This notion of substitutionary atonement, which portrays Jesus dying for the sins of others, raises a paradox: How can the death of an innocent satisfy justice without contradicting God's declaration on individual responsibility?

This paradox is addressed, in part, by how the New Testament authors interpret the role of the sacrificial system. In the Hebrew Scriptures, animals were sacrificed for atonement, symbolically bearing the sins of individuals or the community (such as in Leviticus 16 with the scapegoat). These sacrifices, however, were not considered truly equivalent to the sinner’s life—they were more symbolic acts of repentance and reconciliation. The New Testament writers, particularly Paul, argue that Jesus fulfills and transcends this system, not by simply "taking punishment," but by embodying a path of reconciliation and redemption.

One interpretation could be that Jesus' role as a sacrificial figure is not about punitive substitution but about exposing the consequences of sin—the corruption, oppression, and brokenness of the world—and offering a model for transcending these through love, forgiveness, and transformation. Jesus’ suffering might be understood as a revelation of where humanity's collective sins lead (injustice, betrayal, violence) rather than an exchange of punishment.

In this sense, permission wasn’t given for Jesus to die as a "payment" for others' sins but rather to reveal a path for overcoming sin. This shifts the focus from a legal transaction to a model of transformation and reconciliation. It acknowledges the law of individual accountability, while also providing a spiritual framework for communal healing and renewal without negating God’s justice.

This view doesn't resolve every aspect of the paradox, but it offers a perspective that aligns Jesus' role with the God of justice, where the sacrificial system points to a transformative act rather than a contradiction.

That doesn't really answer anything. It just spins some words in my opinion. It doesn't address the question of who gave permission for an innocent man to die for a guilty man's sin. If God did not give permission for it, how can it stand? Is this the agreement with death that shall not stand, that will be annulled?

You're right to look for a straightforward answer here. At the core of your question is the issue of authority and permission—specifically, whether God permitted a system where an innocent man could die for the sins of others. The question of substitutionary atonement challenges the idea of justice itself, as it seems to bypass God’s declaration about individual responsibility for sin.

If we turn to the prophets, such as Isaiah, we see hints at what you’ve called an "agreement with death." In *Isaiah 28:18*, God indeed says, "Your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with the grave will not stand." This language is directed at those who rely on false security, whether through alliances or doctrines that contradict divine justice. The notion of a "covenant with death" reflects a misalignment with God's principles of life and justice—an arrangement God intends to overturn.

If we interpret Jesus' death through this lens, it could be that substitutionary atonement, as it has been commonly understood, is itself part of the "agreement with death" that God intends to annul. This would mean that God never approved of an innocent dying for the guilty in a literal sense; rather, the sacrificial narrative as interpreted by some became a human construct that obscured God's true nature and justice. Jesus’ role might be seen not as a willing sacrifice to bear others' sins, but as a figure revealing the futility and moral conflict inherent in such an arrangement.

In this light, the sacrificial system—and the idea of someone dying for others' sins—could be seen as a reflection of human misunderstanding, a temporary concession that God permits but does not endorse as just. This would align with God’s intention to establish personal responsibility and annul any arrangement that defies true justice.
