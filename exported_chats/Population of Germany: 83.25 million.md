What's the population of Germany?

---



---

As of mid-2024, the population of Germany is approximately 83.25 million people. This figure represents a slight increase from the previous year, despite a natural decrease due to more deaths than births, which was offset by net migration【7†source】【8†source】【9†source】.

was the population of Germany in the 1930s and 40s.

---

In the 1930s, Germany's population was around sixty million people. By the late 1930s, specifically in 1939, the population had increased significantly to approximately seventy-nine million, largely due to the annexation of Austria, the Sudetenland, and other territories as part of Germany's expansion under the Nazi regime【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】. 

This growth continued into the early 1940s, driven by these geopolitical changes and territorial acquisitions, which added substantial numbers to the overall population.

What was the Jewish population in Germany in the 1930s?

---

In the early 1930s, the Jewish population in Germany was about five hundred thousand people. This represented less than one percent of the total German population. The Jewish community was concentrated primarily in large cities, with significant populations in Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich【18†source】 . 

This population experienced significant persecution and displacement throughout the 1930s, particularly following the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933. The Nazi policies of anti-Semitism and racial purity led to severe restrictions, violence, and eventually the mass deportation and extermination of Jews during the Holocaust.

---

So where did all of the Jews who were persecuted come from if there were only 500,000 Jews in Germany?

---

The total number of Jews persecuted during the Holocaust far exceeded the five hundred thousand Jews living in Germany in the early 1930s. This is because the Nazis extended their campaign of extermination across all of Europe. Jews from occupied countries such as Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, France, and many others were targeted and persecuted.

Poland, for example, had a Jewish population of over three million before the war, and the Soviet Union had around two million. These populations were significantly affected as the Nazis occupied these territories and implemented their genocidal policies. In total, approximately six million Jews were killed during the Holocaust, many of whom came from these occupied regions【17†source】【18†source】.

---

So, what was the total Jewish...

---

The total Jewish population in Europe before World War II was approximately nine million. These Jews lived in various countries across the continent, with the largest populations in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania.

Poland had the largest Jewish community, with over three million Jews. The Soviet Union had around two million Jews, and significant communities existed in Hungary (about eight hundred thousand), Romania (about seven hundred thousand), and Czechoslovakia (approximately three hundred thousand). Western European countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands also had substantial Jewish populations, though smaller in comparison to Eastern Europe【17†source】【18†source】.

During the Holocaust, about six million Jews were killed, representing approximately two-thirds of the European Jewish population. This genocide was carried out through mass shootings, ghettos, forced labor camps, and extermination camps across Nazi-occupied Europe.

---

So where were most of the Jews who were killed from?

---

Most of the Jews who were killed during the Holocaust came from Eastern Europe. Poland had the largest number of Jewish victims, with over three million Jews killed. The Soviet Union also saw a significant number of Jewish deaths, with around one million Soviet Jews perishing. Other countries with large Jewish populations that suffered devastating losses include Hungary, Romania, and Lithuania.

In Poland, the Nazi regime established major extermination camps such as Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Sobibor, where millions of Jews were systematically murdered. The Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing units, were particularly active in the Soviet Union, where they conducted mass shootings of Jews.

Hungary saw a late but intense period of persecution in 1944, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Jews, particularly in Auschwitz. Romania's collaboration with Nazi Germany led to the murder of Jews both in its territories and in areas under its control, like Transnistria.

Overall, the Holocaust's deadliest regions were those with the largest pre-war Jewish populations in Eastern Europe, where Nazi policies were most brutally and effectively implemented【17†source】【18†source】.

Do the Polish and Russians cooperate?

---

The relationship between Poland and Russia has been complex and often tense, shaped by a long history of conflicts, occupations, and differing political paths. However, there have been instances of cooperation between the two nations, particularly in specific areas like economic trade and cultural exchanges.

In recent years, their relationship has been strained due to geopolitical issues. Poland is a member of NATO and the European Union, which often puts it at odds with Russia's policies and actions, especially concerning Ukraine and Eastern Europe. The 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and its actions in Eastern Ukraine have particularly heightened tensions, with Poland strongly supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Despite these political tensions, Poland and Russia have economic ties. For instance, Russia is an important energy supplier to Poland, providing natural gas and oil. There are also cultural and academic exchanges, though these are often overshadowed by the broader political issues.

Historical grievances, particularly from World War II and the Soviet era, continue to influence the relationship. Events such as the Katyn Massacre, where thousands of Polish officers were killed by Soviet forces during World War II, remain a point of contention.

In summary, while there are areas of cooperation between Poland and Russia, their relationship is largely characterized by historical grievances and current geopolitical conflicts【16†source】【18†source】.

The question is, did they cooperate with the Nazis?

---

During World War II, both Poland and Russia had complex and different relationships with Nazi Germany.

Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, marking the start of World War II. Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, following the secret terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. This pact included a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. As a result, Poland was partitioned between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Poland did not cooperate with the Nazis. Instead, the Polish government and military resisted the invasion fiercely. The Polish government-in-exile continued to support the Allied forces and established one of the largest resistance movements in occupied Europe, the Polish Home Army, which fought against both Nazi and Soviet occupiers.

The Soviet Union, under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, initially cooperated with Nazi Germany from 1939 to 1941. This cooperation included territorial division and political alignment, with both powers seeking to consolidate their control over their respective occupied areas. However, this cooperation ended abruptly when Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, on June 22, 1941. Following this, the Soviet Union joined the Allies in the fight against Nazi Germany.

Therefore, while the Soviet Union had a period of cooperation with Nazi Germany through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Poland did not cooperate with the Nazis and was a victim of both German and Soviet aggression during the early years of the war【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】.

---

So were the Soviets cooperating with the Nazis in exterminating Jews?

---

The Soviet Union did not cooperate with Nazi Germany in the extermination of Jews. The relationship between the Soviets and the Nazis was complex, particularly during the period from 1939 to 1941 when the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was in effect. This pact was a non-aggression treaty that included secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. However, this agreement did not include cooperation in the Holocaust or the extermination of Jews.

During the time the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was in effect, both regimes pursued their own brutal policies in the territories they controlled. In the Soviet-occupied areas of Eastern Europe, there was significant repression, including mass deportations and executions of political enemies and perceived threats. However, the Soviets did not engage in the systematic extermination of Jews as part of the Holocaust.

When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), the situation changed dramatically. The Nazi regime's plans for the invasion included the systematic murder of Jews, which was carried out by the Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing units that followed the German army into Soviet territories. The Soviet Union then became a part of the Allied powers fighting against Nazi Germany.

In summary, while the Soviet Union initially cooperated with Nazi Germany in terms of territorial agreements and non-aggression, there was no cooperation in the Holocaust or the extermination of Jews. The Soviet Union's entry into the war against Nazi Germany following the invasion in 1941 marked a shift, with the Soviets fighting against the Nazis and their genocidal policies【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】.

How were they towards the Jews in Russia?

---

The treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union was complex and varied over time. Before and during World War II, Jews in the Soviet Union experienced a range of policies from the Soviet government, which included both periods of relative tolerance and periods of severe repression.

**Before World War II:**
Under Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union's policy towards Jews was influenced by broader Soviet anti-religious campaigns and suspicion of any national minority that might have loyalties outside the Soviet state. This included:
- **Suppression of Jewish Culture:** The Soviet government suppressed Jewish cultural and religious institutions. Yiddish schools, theaters, and publications were closed, and Jewish religious practices were discouraged.
- **Political Repression:** Many Jews, particularly those who were perceived as political opponents or as potential "enemies of the state," were victims of Stalin's purges. This included a significant number of Jewish intellectuals, party officials, and ordinary citizens.

**During World War II:**
- **Nazi Occupation:** In the territories occupied by Nazi Germany during Operation Barbarossa, Soviet Jews were among the first to be targeted by the Einsatzgruppen and other Nazi killing units. Mass shootings and other atrocities were carried out against Jewish populations in these areas.
- **Evacuation and Survival:** Many Jews were evacuated to the interior of the Soviet Union, particularly to Central Asia and Siberia, to escape the advancing Nazi forces. These evacuees often faced harsh conditions, but many survived the war.
- **Red Army Service:** A significant number of Soviet Jews served in the Red Army and participated in the fight against Nazi Germany. Some achieved notable military honors for their service.

**Post-World War II:**
- **State Anti-Semitism:** After the war, Stalin's regime began to adopt increasingly anti-Semitic policies. This culminated in the late 1940s and early 1950s with the so-called "Doctors' Plot," an anti-Semitic campaign accusing Jewish doctors of plotting to kill Soviet leaders. Although Stalin's death in 1953 led to the end of this particular campaign, state-sponsored anti-Semitism persisted in various forms.
- **Suppression of Jewish Identity:** The Soviet government continued to suppress Jewish cultural and religious life. Jews faced discrimination in education, employment, and other areas. Jewish activism and emigration were severely restricted until the latter part of the Cold War.

In summary, while Soviet Jews did not face systematic extermination by their own government as they did under the Nazis, they endured significant persecution, suppression of their cultural and religious practices, and periods of severe political repression both before and after World War II【17†source】【18†source】.
