# Designing SDP Transition Proposal



---



---

I'm working on a proposal for the Department of Developmental Services Regional Centers, specifically in Los Angeles County at the Westside Regional Center, where my son is a client with severe autism. We have become a part of the Self-Determination Program, and this is our second year in the program. We would be considered a success story, and I have been asked to participate in a program to help them to figure out why other clients are not accessing the services or having success in getting into the Self-Determination Program. I was hired as a consultant, as a researcher, because that's my expertise in a previous study that was funded by the DDS and partnered with the California Children's Hospital at USC, CCUSDD, I think it is, or I'm not sure the initials, but I was hired by them to go on a project with a researcher who is the PI that I know, Olga Solomon. We studied utilization of services in African Americans and why African Americans were not accessing the services, so we studied barriers to access already. I have the findings from that. I would like to design now a proposal for an SDP transition program that I'm designing. I have the design here, and I want to get the proposal worked out and look at the steps that I have outlined here. I'd like to feed them to you and get an organized proposal going.

SDP Transition Program

Phase 1:
Study - What are barriers and Solutions
 •Case Studies -(our success story) 
 •focus Groups

Phase 2:
Self Determination Program Transition Center-

Client-run SDP Transition Education Center


Obstacles encountered:
	•	Obstacle 1:  A lack of knowledge about the potential benefits of the SDP program.   •SDP gives clients the potential to determine how their days will be spent, and with whom they will get to do those things.  •They could choose qualified people who have been involved in their lives and are invested in their dreams.  •The Person Centered Plan is the nucleus of this. And this is designed with the client and their love ones or care providers.  •This can be a family member or friend who has been involved with the care and knows the client.  • Having such support systems in place can be a key element of success in SDP
	•	﻿﻿lack of available financial management Services (FMS) •The lack of available financial management services lead to congestion at a crucial information juncture for clients. •This could lead to a bottleneck when it comes to people trying to enter the program and could be seen as a major deterrence. •Clients suffer from lack of a clear process •Cultural and language barriers at the FMS cause hiccups in the process  Solution:  •Train Families in Financial Management skills, understanding the 3 payer options available,  responsibilities of running a business and employer relationship. •Seek out options for families to use as FMS payers that can work with the various cultural and developmental challenges of Regional Center clients. 

	•	Obstacle 3:  Finding qualified service providers/Becoming a contractor.  • IHSS is a case study example of mass adoption of a program for providing a less restrictive option for care providers. It allows individuals to become employees working for the client.  When SDP participants find a qualified service provider they would like to hire, an IHSS-like onboarding process could prepare contractors for the  process to allow easier access to choice providers. 

The SDP transition center would provide all of the services and trainings. It could allow for a 1 to 3 year transition into SDP, in which individuals learn the skills required to participate in SDP, which is akin to an entrepreneurial startup program for developmental disabilities.

The Person-Centered Plan is drafted, providers are on boarded, and team members are coached in the skills they’ll need to be an employer and to independently seek continual improvement in service providers

Certainly! Here's a draft for the introduction of your SDP Transition Program proposal:

---

**Introduction**

The Self-Determination Program (SDP) represents a transformative approach in the realm of developmental services, offering individuals with developmental disabilities a unique opportunity to take charge of their lives. Central to this approach is the empowerment of clients, enabling them to make informed decisions about their care and services based on their personal preferences and needs. However, despite its potential, many eligible individuals in Los Angeles County, particularly those under the Westside Regional Center, have yet to fully access or benefit from the SDP.

As a testament to the program's success, my family's journey with the SDP stands as a beacon of its potential. Our experience, navigating through the complexities and harnessing the program's offerings, has led us to a path of meaningful progress and fulfillment for my son, who is a client with severe autism. This personal success story underscores the transformative impact the SDP can have.

My role as a consultant and researcher, backed by extensive experience in studying service utilization barriers within developmental services – notably in a previous study funded by the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) in partnership with the California Children's Hospital at USC – positions me uniquely to address this challenge. The insights gained from researching barriers to service access among African American communities have laid a foundational understanding of the diverse challenges faced by different groups in accessing developmental services.

This proposal aims to introduce the SDP Transition Program, an initiative designed to bridge the gap between potential SDP beneficiaries and the program's empowering offerings. By identifying the barriers to entry and participation, and by establishing a client-run SDP Transition Education Center, we aim to pave a smoother path for individuals and families towards self-determination. This program is not just an educational venture; it's a commitment to unlocking the full potential of the SDP, ensuring that all eligible individuals in our community can access and thrive within this empowering framework.
