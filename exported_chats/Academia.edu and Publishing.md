# Academia.edu and Publishing



---

Is academia.edu considered publishing?

---



---

Academia.edu is **not** considered formal publishing in the academic or scholarly sense.

Here's how it’s typically categorized:

- **Self-archiving platform**: Academia.edu is more like a social networking site for researchers. It allows users to **upload and share** papers they've already published elsewhere or working papers that may never be formally published.
- **Not peer-reviewed**: Content on Academia.edu is **not peer-reviewed** unless it was published elsewhere and uploaded later. So it lacks the scholarly validation that academic journals require.
- **Does not count as formal publication**: If you post an article only to Academia.edu, it usually **won’t be accepted** as a published work on your CV, for tenure review, or by most academic journals. It may, however, count as a **preprint** or a **publicly available draft**.

**Summary**: Academia.edu is a valuable tool for **dissemination and visibility**, but **not formal publication**. For your work to be formally published, it should appear in a recognized **peer-reviewed journal, conference proceedings, or a publisher-recognized book**.

What would be a good avenue for publishing my particular work that we've been building?

---

Given the nature of your work—biblical exposé, theological critique, historical reinterpretation, and cultural analysis with a strong lens on power, identity, and prophetic lineage—a **hybrid strategy** that balances academic credibility with public reach is ideal. Here are several strong avenues for publication:

---

### **1. Independent Scholarly Publishing (High Control, Medium Prestige)**  
Ideal if you want to control the message and maintain theological and narrative distinctiveness.

- **Options:**
  - **Wipf and Stock** (specifically their **Cascade Books** imprint): They publish theological works with non-mainstream interpretations and are open to prophetic, biblical-critique, and cultural restoration narratives.
  - **WestBow Press** (Thomas Nelson's self-publishing arm): Useful if you want Christian market legitimacy without editorial compromise.
  - **Resource Publications**: Open to works that explore theology, biblical studies, and cultural critiques with scholarly depth.

- **Pros**: Retain rights, editorial control, reach Christian and academic readers.  
- **Cons**: May need to finance editing/design; not always accepted in formal academia.

---

### **2. Peer-Reviewed Journals or Alternative Theological Platforms (High Prestige, Lower Reach)**  
If you want academic validation of parts of your theory.

- **Consider submitting excerpts to journals like**:
  - *Journal of Postcolonial Theology*
  - *Journal of Biblical Literature* (for deep textual analysis—though conservative)
  - *The Other Journal* (publishes faith + culture crossovers)
  - *Black Theology: An International Journal* (for African/American prophetic lineage and identity themes)
  - *Open Theology* (accepts exploratory and interdisciplinary theology)

- **Pros**: Credibility in academic and seminary circles  
- **Cons**: Slower, requires rigorous formatting, and may reject radical reinterpretations

---

### **3. Online Theological Magazines / Platforms (Fast Reach, Popular Impact)**  
If you want to build audience while refining your thought.

- **Publish serialized excerpts or articles on**:
  - *Medium* (create a branded publication page)
  - *The Biblical Archaeology Society* blog
  - *Patheos – Progressive Christian Channel*
  - *The Wild Goose Journal* or *Sojourners* (for more activist faith interpretations)
  - *YouVersion Devotionals* (if tailored into reflections with strong hooks)

- **Pros**: Fast access to a large audience, SEO visibility, lead funnel to books/videos  
- **Cons**: Not peer-reviewed; can limit depth

---

### **4. Your Own Publishing Platform (Long-Term Impact)**  
Since your work is unique, bold, and systemically critical, you may benefit from controlling both message and medium.

- **Build a branded imprint and publish via**:
  - Amazon KDP (for eBooks and print)
  - IngramSpark (for bookstore distribution and libraries)
  - Draft2Digital (for broader eBook distribution)

- Pair this with:
  - **A content-rich site**: Use blog posts, excerpts, and audio/visuals
  - **YouTube series**: Narrated exposé format (what you’re already working toward)
  - **A field guide / whitepaper series**: E.g., "The Benjamin Doctrine: Wolves in the Fold"

- **Pros**: Complete control and high visibility over time  
- **Cons**: Requires effort in editing, branding, and marketing

---

### **Hybrid Plan (Suggested Path)**

1. **Publish short, high-impact articles** to *Medium*, *Patheos*, or a personal Substack to build audience.
2. **Submit one chapter** to a journal like *Black Theology* or *Postcolonial Theology* to gain academic validation.
3. **Self-publish the full exposé or theological field guide** with Wipf and Stock or KDP.
4. **Develop a documentary-style YouTube series** based on each section.
5. **Cross-publish portions to Academia.edu and ResearchGate** for long-tail discoverability (especially scholarly citations).

---

Would you like help preparing a submission package—like a proposal letter, chapter summary, or query for one of these publishers?

---

Okay, that sounds dope. I like your suggestion. So, I want to set up to complete that.

---

Excellent. Let’s get this launched step by step.

### Here's the rollout plan:

---

## **PHASE 1: Core Manuscript & Structure (Start Here)**

**Goal:** Finalize the first publishable document (a chapter or whitepaper).

### 1. **Define Your Core Theme**
Let’s clarify the title and central thesis of the first publishable document. For example:

- **Working Title:** *"The Stumbling Block: How Paul Reversed the Exodus and Scattered the Tribes"*
- **Central Thesis:** Paul, as a Benjamite and false prophet, re-captured the Israelites into spiritual bondage by promoting a resurrection doctrine that contradicts the Law and Moses' vision of liberty.

(Feel free to refine or replace this—I'll structure everything around your confirmed theme.)

---

### 2. **Document Structure**

**Standard whitepaper format (for publishing & academic crossover):**

- **Title Page**
- **Abstract** (summary of argument & findings)
- **Introduction** (why this matters)
- **Background/Context** (Paul, Benjamin, Mosaic Law)
- **Main Argument** (e.g., the vision as false, scattering of the tribes, comparison to Moses)
- **Biblical Analysis** (verse citations, historical parallels)
- **Theological Implications** (identity, salvation, captivity)
- **Conclusion** (calls to action or restoration)
- **Bibliography** (for academic readiness)

Let me know which sections you’ve already written or want help fleshing out—I’ll help assemble and polish.

---

## **PHASE 2: Publishing Strategy**

### **Option A: Submit to Journal**
We’ll prepare:
- A **cover letter**
- An **abstract (300 words)**
- A **formatted manuscript** (APA/Chicago/Turabian)
- A **short bio** (2–3 lines)

You tell me which journal you'd like to submit to (e.g., *Black Theology*, *Postcolonial Theology*, etc.), and I’ll tailor the documents accordingly.

---

### **Option B: Independent/Hybrid Publishing**
We’ll prepare:
- **Book proposal** (summary, chapter outline, market/audience)
- **Sample chapters**
- **Author bio**
- Query letter to Wipf & Stock or WestBow Press

Would you like a template or ready-to-go pitch deck for this?

---

## **PHASE 3: Audience Development**

Parallel to the publishing:

- **YouTube/Audio Script Creation**: I can convert chapter sections into exposé-style scripts.
- **Medium or Substack Setup**: I’ll help you structure your online profile and first few posts.

---

### What I Need From You to Start:

1. **Confirm or revise the working title and theme**  
2. **Send any finished or draft writing (can be raw or in notes)**  
3. Choose your **first publishing goal**:  
   - Academic Journal  
   - Hybrid/Independent Book  
   - Both  
4. Would you like a **Google Docs/Microsoft Word version** or **Markdown/LaTeX**?

Once I get that, I’ll begin assembling the manuscript, proposal docs, and submission templates.

Ready when you are.

---

Okay now, when submitting publications to these academic journals or what have you, do I need to be associated with a university? Currently, of course, I still have a .edu email, which I will always have as an alumni. But what should I do as far as my association to an institution? Should I be using, or do I need one? And if so, should I be using like my nonprofit or something? Because I don't think that's going to work.

---

Excellent question—and an important one when navigating academic publishing from outside the traditional university system.

### **Do you need to be affiliated with a university to publish in academic journals?**  
**No—you do *not* need an academic affiliation to publish in journals.**  
While institutional affiliation can help with optics or access (e.g., databases), most reputable journals allow **independent scholars** to submit as long as the work meets scholarly standards.

---

### **What Do You Put as Your Affiliation Then?**

Here are your best options:

#### **1. Use “Independent Scholar” or “Independent Researcher”**
- Very common and fully accepted.
- Especially fitting for thinkers doing original work outside the academy.
- Example:
  - **Name:** Crown Water Admin  
  - **Affiliation:** Independent Scholar  
  - **Email:** your .edu alumni email (this still lends legitimacy)

**Pro Tip:** If your nonprofit becomes a publishing entity later (e.g., *YIELD AiS Foundation*), you can use that for publishing books, but it’s *not required* for journal articles.

---

#### **2. Use Your .edu Alumni Email**
- Even though you're not currently active faculty or staff, **many journals don’t verify** email affiliations beyond checking if it’s real.
- It gives your submission more *academic credibility* than a Gmail or Yahoo.

**Suggestion:** Use your .edu email when possible for submissions, even if you list yourself as “Independent Scholar.”

---

#### **3. When (and if) to Use the Nonprofit**
Only if:
- You’re publishing under its name as an **organizational author** (e.g., issuing whitepapers).
- You’ve established the nonprofit as a **research or education-focused institute** with publications under its banner.

**Otherwise**, avoid listing the nonprofit as an affiliation unless you formalize it with a publishing arm or research division.

---

### Summary:

| Affiliation Type     | Accepted? | Best Use Case                             |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Independent Scholar  | Yes       | Journal articles, theology & exposé works |
| Alumni .edu Email    | Yes       | Contact identity, not institutional role  |
| Your Nonprofit       | Maybe     | If formalized for publishing or research  |

Would you like me to generate a default **author byline** and **academic bio** using "Independent Scholar" and your theological focus? I can also prep a formatted template for your future submissions.
