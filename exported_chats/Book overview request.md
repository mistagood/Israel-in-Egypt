- May reflect **older oral traditions** and initiatory sayings.

## ✳️ THEMATIC OUTLINE

### I. **God and the One**
- God is the **all**, unknowable in essence but knowable through His works.
- The One is the source of all multiplicity.
- God is mind, life, light, and goodness—absolute and eternal.

### II. **The Divine Mind (Nous)**
- The Divine Mind is the **instrument of creation**, through Logos (Word).
- Humanity has a spark of this Mind.
- Alignment with Nous is the path to salvation.

### III. **Creation and the Cosmos**
- The universe is **alive and rational**, formed by divine intention.
- Stars, planets, and time are part of a divine order.
- Nature is both a veil and a revelation of God.

### IV. **Man as Microcosm**
- Man is a **twofold being**: mortal body, immortal spirit.
- He was made in God’s image, a reflection of the divine.
- The fall into matter led to forgetfulness of divine origin.

### V. **Spiritual Rebirth (Palingenesia)**
- True knowledge (gnosis) leads to **awakening**.
- Rebirth is not physical, but **spiritual**, a re-entry into divine mind.
- Requires purification, contemplation, and union with the Good.

### VI. **Ethics and Divine Ascent**
- The way of Hermes is a **moral and mystical discipline**:
  - Restrain passions.
  - Seek knowledge.
  - Cultivate virtues.
- The goal is to become a **god in spirit**—divinized through knowledge and love.

### VII. **Prophecy and the Fate of Egypt**
- Some texts (e.g., *Asclepius*) prophesy **Egypt’s spiritual decline**:
  - Temples will fall into ruin.
  - The knowledge of the divine will be forgotten.
  - Only a few will preserve the truth.
