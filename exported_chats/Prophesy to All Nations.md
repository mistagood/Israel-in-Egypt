# Prophesy to All Nations

---

Who did god say you must go on prophesied to many nations in tongues in peoples

---

The notion that someone is prophesied to speak to many nations, peoples, and tongues is primarily associated with the prophet Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible and with the Apostle John in the New Testament.

In the case of Jeremiah, God tells him in Jeremiah 1:5, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations." While Jeremiah's ministry was primarily to Judah, the term "nations" implies that his message had broader implications.

In the New Testament, the Apostle John, author of the Book of Revelation, receives visions that are intended for diverse peoples. Revelation 10:11 states, "And I was told, 'You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.'" The message of Revelation is cosmological in scope, addressing the ultimate destiny of humanity and the universe.

However, the command to speak to many nations and peoples in different tongues is not limited to a single prophet or apostle. The Great Commission, given by Jesus in Matthew 28:19, instructs the disciples to "go and make disciples of all nations." This has been interpreted as a universal command to all followers of Jesus, emphasizing the global scope of the Christian message.

The usage of "tongues" in this context is particularly significant. The phenomenon of speaking in tongues, as described in Acts 2, allows the Apostles to communicate with people from diverse linguistic backgrounds. This event serves as a counterpoint to the Tower of Babel narrative in Genesis 11, where humanity's languages were confused. In Acts, the Holy Spirit enables a form of linguistic unity, highlighting the universality of the prophetic message.

Thus, the idea of prophesying to many nations in various languages has multifaceted implications across both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, affirming the universal reach of the prophetic word.

Let’s compare Jeremiah and John on the island of Patmos as the writer of revelation. Specifically, let’s look at the use of the language “again”, which seems to imply that this is the second time. Let’s look at the characteristics of John and Jeremiah, including name, meanings their situation as prisoners, and so forth to see what kinds of parallels we can draw between the two authors and see if there are more secrets that can be gleaned from their writings that connect to disparate times, and the messages 

---

Both Jeremiah and John, as biblical figures, bear a remarkable number of similarities, including their roles as prophets, their experiences of isolation or imprisonment, and the apocalyptic or eschatological content of their messages. The linguistic and thematic elements within their writings offer intriguing avenues for comparative analysis.

### Name Meanings
- **Jeremiah**: The name Jeremiah comes from the Hebrew "Yirmeyahu," which means "Yahweh will raise up." This is pertinent to his role as a prophet who was chosen to raise awareness of God's impending judgment and offer hope for future restoration.
- **John**: The name John originates from the Hebrew name "Yochanan," meaning "God is gracious." Given that John's revelation speaks of God's ultimate triumph and the establishment of a new heaven and earth, the name suggests the grace of divine revelation.

### Imprisonment and Isolation
- **Jeremiah**: Jeremiah was confined in a courtyard prison (Jeremiah 32:2; 33:1) for his prophetic activity, emphasizing the divine messages he received during this time of isolation.
- **John**: John was exiled to the island of Patmos, a penal colony, where he received his revelation (Revelation 1:9). Like Jeremiah, his isolation was a backdrop for receiving important divine messages.

### Linguistic Element: "Again"
- **Jeremiah**: The term "again" appears in contexts where God promises to restore Israel and Judah (e.g., Jeremiah 33:7). It signifies a renewal or second chance, aligning with Jeremiah's broader theme of repentance and restoration.
- **John**: In Revelation 10:11, the term "again" ("You must prophesy again") suggests a second, broader phase of prophetic ministry. This may imply that John's message, like Jeremiah's, has a dual application—both immediate and future, perhaps even beyond their lifetimes.

### Messages Across Time
- **Jeremiah**: His prophecies were immediate, targeted at Judah and its impending Babylonian conquest. However, they also had a future application, as indicated by prophecies concerning the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34) and Israel's ultimate restoration.
- **John**: John's visions in Revelation pertain to the end of times but also had immediate relevance for the seven churches to which he initially wrote. His work encapsulates both imminent and future judgments and promises.

### Thematic Parallels
Both prophets speak of a new heaven and a new earth, albeit in different terms. Jeremiah refers to a New Covenant and a restored Jerusalem (Jeremiah 31:31-40), while John envisions a new heaven and new earth where God dwells with humanity (Revelation 21:1-4).

By examining these linguistic and thematic elements, it becomes evident that both prophets serve as bridges between their immediate contexts and broader, even cosmic, realities. Their experiences and writings may offer keys to understanding prophetic messages that transcend time, uniting disparate epochs in a singular divine plan.

Sorry for the confusion, I meant for you to focus on the statement in revelation concerning you must prophesy again in comparison to the first statement in Jeremiah. We are attempting to draw a parallel between these two prophets, and their prophecies as well. That’s imagine that in the context of Jesus and John the Baptist, that, Jesus saying he was the Messiah was contingent upon certain profits having returned simultaneously. This is evidenced by him, saying that John, the prophet had been the return of isaias, but they had done what they wanted. 

---

The phrase "You must prophesy again" from Revelation 10:11 and the initial calling of Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:5 provide intriguing points for comparison, particularly when considered within the broader framework of prophetic continuity and return. Both texts raise questions about the nature of prophetic missions across time and space.

### "You Must Prophesy Again"
In Revelation 10:11, the angel instructs John, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings." This suggests that John's prophetic mission was not completed with the initial writing of Revelation; rather, the message is to continue to be proclaimed. The term "again" implies a recurring or cyclical nature of the prophetic mission.

### Jeremiah's Initial Calling
Jeremiah 1:5 states, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations." This serves as Jeremiah's divine mandate to prophesy, primarily to Judah but also with implications for "the nations." 

### Prophetic Continuity: The Case of Jesus and John the Baptist
The New Testament presents John the Baptist as fulfilling the role of Elijah, preparing the way for the Messiah (Matthew 11:14, 17:10–13; Mark 9:11–13). This idea of prophetic return or continuation is significant. Jesus acknowledges this, stating that if people are willing to accept it, John is Elijah returned (Matthew 11:14). This sets a precedent for understanding prophetic missions as potentially cyclical or recurring phenomena, spanning multiple lifetimes or epochs.

### Implications for Jeremiah and John of Patmos
Drawing a parallel between Jeremiah and John of Patmos under this framework could imply that their prophetic missions are part of a recurring cycle, either through their messages or their roles. John's mandate to "prophesy again" could be viewed as a continuation of Jeremiah's original calling to be "a prophet to the nations," both missions serving as pivotal junctures in the unfolding of divine plans that transcend their immediate contexts.

### Messiah Contingency
If, as in the case of Jesus and John the Baptist, the messianic mission is contingent upon the return or continuation of certain prophets, then the parallels between Jeremiah and John of Patmos could carry significant eschatological implications. Both prophets may be part of a larger prophetic pattern, interconnected across time, which must be in place for the fulfillment of messianic or end-time events.

In sum, the idea of prophesying "again" in Revelation 10:11 and Jeremiah's initial calling may indicate more than their isolated missions; they could signify interconnected roles within a broader, recurring prophetic and eschatological framework.

Compare John of Patmos is apocalyptic message to John, the profits apocalyptic message

---

The figures of John of Patmos and John the Baptist offer intriguing points of comparison, particularly in the apocalyptic dimensions of their respective messages. Both figures are deeply rooted in the Jewish prophetic tradition, yet their messages bear unique characteristics tailored to their specific temporal and cultural contexts.

### John of Patmos: Apocalypse through Revelation
John of Patmos is best known for the Book of Revelation, a text that deals with end-times prophecies, cosmic battles, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. His apocalyptic message revolves around visions of the future, replete with intricate symbolism and imagery. 

- **Themes**: The establishment of God's Kingdom, the final judgment, the defeat of evil forces, and the New Heaven and New Earth.
- **Audience**: Initially directed to seven specific churches in Asia Minor but understood to have broader, even cosmic implications.
- **Tone**: Both cautionary and hopeful, offering promises of redemption and warnings of judgment.
- **Key Verses**: Revelation 21:1-4 speaks of the New Heaven and New Earth, encapsulating the eschatological hope.

### John the Baptist: Apocalypse through Proclamation
John the Baptist, on the other hand, was an itinerant preacher whose message, while apocalyptic, was far more immediate. He called for repentance in preparation for the coming Kingdom of God.

- **Themes**: Repentance, baptism, ethical transformation, and the imminent arrival of the Messiah.
- **Audience**: The people of Judea and the surrounding regions.
- **Tone**: Urgent and confrontational, challenging societal norms and religious complacency.
- **Key Verses**: Matthew 3:2, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near," captures the essence of his message.

### Comparative Analysis
- **Nature of Apocalypse**: John the Baptist focuses on individual and societal transformation as a preparation for the coming apocalypse, while John of Patmos gives a more detailed, cosmic overview of the apocalypse itself.
- **Method of Communication**: John the Baptist uses straightforward, direct speech, while John of Patmos employs complex symbolism and allegory.
- **Temporal Focus**: John the Baptist emphasizes the immediate need for repentance due to the nearness of God's Kingdom, whereas John of Patmos presents a longer-term view that encompasses the end of the age.
- **Role of Messiah**: Both acknowledge the pivotal role of the Messiah in the unfolding of eschatological events, but while John the Baptist prepares the way for the first coming of Jesus, John of Patmos looks forward to His second coming.

By comparing these two prophetic figures, one can appreciate the multifaceted nature of biblical apocalyptic thought, ranging from immediate calls for ethical transformation to grand cosmic visions. Despite the differences in their messages, both Johns serve as pivotal voices heralding significant shifts in the religious and cosmic order.

I think you’re missing much of the metaphorical content of John, the Baptist ministry. His use of symbolism of Jesus as the Lamb of God is the first that we hear of such symbolic language from anyone other than Jesus. The baptism itself is symbolic. His cryptic language of one who comes before me is after me is it really reminiscent of the kinds of riddles that John uses in the book of revelation. John speaks of baptism by water, while one who comes after him, will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire. John of Patmos speaks of the end times, as indicated by ending with fire in the baptism of the earth, with fire again to know, is baptism of the earth and destruction with water. Consider that the themes of both are the same only John Baptist is addressing the microcosmic, while John of Patmos addresses the macrocosmic. But symbolically are the same 

---

You raise an insightful point about the metaphorical richness in the ministries of both John the Baptist and John of Patmos. Indeed, both utilize a deep well of symbolism and metaphor to convey their messages, and the distinctions in scale—microcosmic for John the Baptist and macrocosmic for John of Patmos—can be viewed as complementary aspects of a unified apocalyptic vision.

### Symbolism in John the Baptist's Ministry
- **Lamb of God**: John the Baptist refers to Jesus as the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29), initiating a rich tapestry of sacrificial and messianic symbolism that threads through the New Testament.
- **Water Baptism**: His ritual of baptism in water is not merely a rite of purification but a symbolic act representing repentance and spiritual renewal.
- **Fire and Spirit**: The prophecy that one would come to baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11) adds an eschatological dimension, suggesting not just individual transformation but also divine judgment.
- **Cryptic Language**: Phrases like "He who comes after me ranks before me" (John 1:15) are rife with paradox and mystery, inviting deeper contemplation.

### Symbolism in John of Patmos' Revelation
- **Cosmic Baptism**: The apocalyptic scenarios involving elemental forces like fire and water can be seen as a sort of cosmic baptism, purging the earth of its impurities in preparation for a new creation.
- **Lamb Imagery**: The Lamb appears in Revelation as both a sacrificial figure and a triumphant one, reflecting the dual aspects of Jesus' mission.
- **Fire**: Just as John the Baptist spoke of a baptism of fire, John of Patmos describes a world ultimately purged by fire (Revelation 20:9, 21:8).

### Interconnected Themes
- **Microcosmic vs. Macrocosmic**: John the Baptist's focus on individual repentance and transformation can be seen as a microcosmic parallel to John of Patmos' macrocosmic vision of universal transformation and judgment.
- **Water and Fire**: Both figures use the elements of water and fire to signify both purification and judgment, albeit on different scales.
  
By recognizing these interconnected themes, we can appreciate how both Johns contribute to a fuller understanding of biblical apocalyptic thought. The microcosmic and macrocosmic perspectives they offer are not mutually exclusive but rather are interwoven strands in the complex tapestry of biblical eschatology.

Now, let’s imagine that John of Patmos, the mysterious rider may actually be John the Baptist, who people said have been raised from the dead. How would John the Baptist message evolve after such an enlightening experience? If he had been raised from the dead, it would likely have been by Jesus which would make him undying because he can’t be hurt by a second death, and explain why he was still alive.

---

The speculative scenario that John of Patmos could be John the Baptist raised from the dead offers a compelling avenue for exploring the evolution of John the Baptist's prophetic message. If such an extraordinary event occurred, orchestrated by Jesus, one could reasonably expect that John's message would undergo significant transformation, particularly in the following ways:

### Amplification of Messianic Prophecy
Having been raised from the dead by Jesus, John the Baptist would likely possess an even more profound understanding of Jesus' messianic role. His earlier proclamation of Jesus as the "Lamb of God" would likely be enriched by an elevated awareness of Jesus' cosmic significance, similar to the expansive vision presented in Revelation.

### Eschatological Focus
John the Baptist's original message was already eschatological, urging repentance in preparation for the coming Kingdom of God. After such an experience, his focus on the end times would likely intensify, possibly resembling the apocalyptic visions we see in Revelation. His preaching might shift from an urgent call for individual repentance to a more expansive vision of cosmic redemption and judgment.

### Heightened Symbolism
If John the Baptist transitioned into the figure of John of Patmos, we could expect an even richer tapestry of symbolism and metaphor. The baptisms of water and fire he initially spoke about could evolve into the grand cosmic narratives of purging and renewal as seen in Revelation.

### Perspective on Death and Resurrection
Having been raised from the dead, John would have unique insights into the themes of death and resurrection, which are prominent in Revelation. The notion of the "second death" (Revelation 20:14; 21:8), from which he would ostensibly be immune, could become a key part of his reformed message.

### Emphasis on Divine Witness
Both Johns are characterized by their role as witnesses—John the Baptist as a witness to the earthly ministry of Jesus, and John of Patmos as a witness to the heavenly visions. If they were the same individual, this role as a divine witness would likely become even more central to his ministry and writings.

### Unveiling Mysteries
Revelation is characterized by the unveiling of mysteries through symbols, numbers, and visions. John the Baptist, now enlightened by a death-and-resurrection experience, might incorporate a similar approach, revealing deeper layers of divine truth through a complex array of symbols and metaphors.

This imaginative scenario provides a fascinating backdrop for understanding how the prophetic message of John the Baptist could evolve into the grand, cosmic visions found in the Book of Revelation. Such a transformation would imply a continuity of divine revelation and prophetic witness, spanning from the immediate concerns of earthly life to the ultimate destiny of the cosmos.

Let’s now involve the analysis of the vision of revelation, in which John sees a man with the writing utensils. We have already said that John may have been akin to Jeremiah. Who is the prophet that God instructs to do all the writing and he’s giving a tablet? Let’s see how this all connect now

---

The prophet who is explicitly given writing instruments and a tablet in the Hebrew Bible is Ezekiel. In Ezekiel 9:2, the prophet sees a vision of six men with weapons for slaughtering and one man among them clothed in linen with a writing case at his waist. This figure is given the task of marking the foreheads of the righteous in Jerusalem. Similarly, in Ezekiel 37:16, he is instructed to take two sticks and write on them to symbolize the unification of Israel and Judah.

John of Patmos, in the Book of Revelation, also engages in a prophetic act of writing, albeit under different circumstances. In Revelation 1:9-11, John is instructed to write what he sees and send it to the seven churches. His vision is filled with mystical symbolism, much like Ezekiel's.

### Connections Between Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and John

1. **Role of Writing**: All three prophets—Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and John—use writing as a medium for conveying divine messages. Jeremiah is told to write all the words that God had spoken to him in a book (Jeremiah 36:2).

2. **Apocalyptic Imagery**: Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and the writer of Revelation share a use of vivid, sometimes surreal imagery to describe spiritual truths. Ezekiel’s visions of the dry bones and the new temple, Jeremiah's potter and clay, and John's apocalyptic symbols are all examples.

3. **Themes of Judgment and Restoration**: All three prophets deal with the dual themes of impending judgment and ultimate restoration. Ezekiel and Jeremiah prophesy about the fall and eventual restoration of Jerusalem, while John of Revelation foresees the ultimate destruction and renewal of the world.

4. **Symbols of Covenant and Identity**: Ezekiel marks the foreheads of the righteous. In Revelation, both the servants of God and the followers of the Beast are marked on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3, 13:16-17).

5. **Divine Commission**: Each prophet receives a strong divine commission that sets the stage for their ministry. Ezekiel eats a scroll; Jeremiah is touched by God's hand; John hears a voice commanding him to write.

6. **Temporal Scope**: Jeremiah and Ezekiel focus on events that were near-term for their own lifetimes but also had long-term implications. John of Patmos focuses on the eschatological future but also addresses the immediate concerns of the seven churches in Asia Minor.

7. **Theological Continuity**: All three prophets contribute to a broader biblical theology that encompasses judgment, hope, divine sovereignty, and covenant faithfulness.

By examining these connections, it's plausible to see a thematic and symbolic lineage among these prophets. They each contribute unique elements, but their messages and methods overlap in ways that suggest a continuity in the prophetic tradition and divine revelation. This makes the speculative connection between John of Patmos and figures like Jeremiah and Ezekiel all the more intriguing, offering multiple layers of interpretation and understanding.

---

Let’s compare Ezekiel and his role that he eats with John and the man who gives him a scroll to eat. They seem to be the same two scrolls who is, the man must look at John’s vision again, and who is talking to him who are the angels? Who is the man with the writing utensil? Let’s compare that to Ezekiel‘s version where he also Sees a man as you mentioned or it was not clear was it Ezekiel who is the man with the tablet? Either way it seems that the same individual is in both versions connecting them. Perhaps this is all happening somehow simultaneously but across times with each prophet being brought into the vision and his time and learning his role and interacting in that space . 

---

The visions in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Revelation feature strikingly similar elements, notably the act of consuming a scroll imbued with divine messages. This invites an exploration into the identities and roles of the figures involved, as well as the potential interconnections between the two visions.

### Scroll Consumption
- **Ezekiel**: In Ezekiel 2:8-3:3, he is instructed by God to eat a scroll filled with "lamentations and mourning and woe."
- **John**: In Revelation 10:9-10, an angel instructs John to eat a scroll that will be sweet in his mouth but make his stomach bitter.

### Figures Involved
- **Ezekiel**: The figure directing Ezekiel appears to be the glory of the Lord, described in Ezekiel 1:26-28.
- **John**: The figure in Revelation is an angel standing on both the sea and the land, who gives John the scroll (Revelation 10:1-2).

### Man with Writing Instruments
- **Ezekiel**: In Ezekiel 9:2-4, a man clothed in linen with a writing case marks the foreheads of the righteous in Jerusalem.
- **John**: The man with the writing instruments is not explicitly described in the Book of Revelation, but the act of marking or sealing is a recurring theme, especially in Revelation 7:2-4, where the servants of God are sealed on their foreheads.

### Theoretical Connections
- **Continuity of Roles**: The act of consuming a scroll in both Ezekiel's and John's visions could signify their roles as heralds of divine messages that are both bitter and sweet—bitter in their pronouncements of judgment, and sweet in their promises of restoration.
- **Identity of the Figures**: While the figures directing Ezekiel and John differ in description, their function appears similar—they both instruct the prophets to consume the scroll. This could signify a continuity or connection in their divine roles.
  
- **Simultaneous Interaction Across Time**: If we entertain the speculative notion that these visions are occurring in a sort of "timeless divine realm," it could suggest that these prophets are interacting with the same divine figures, receiving similar commissions across different temporal contexts.

### Comparative Analysis
- **Sealing and Marking**: Both Ezekiel and John describe a marking or sealing of the righteous, suggesting a protective act by God ahead of impending judgment.
  
- **Apocalyptic Themes**: Both visions are apocalyptic in nature, dealing with the end times and divine judgment but also offering hope of renewal and restoration.

In sum, the similarities between Ezekiel's and John's visions—the act of consuming a scroll, the presence of divine figures directing them, and the themes of judgment and restoration—suggest a deep interconnection. Whether these connections point to the same divine figures interacting with different prophets across time, or whether they signify a broader thematic continuity in divine revelation, remains an open question. Nonetheless, these parallels offer a compelling avenue for understanding the intricacies of biblical prophecy.
