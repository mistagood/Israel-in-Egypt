# Buying Commercial Property Canada



---

I'd like to buy property in Canada, maybe Saskatchewan, but as an American, I understand there are restrictions on residential properties, but perhaps we're going to make some land purchases in rural places close to town with some of the amenities that we need that we can have land and space and begin to build, have maybe at least starting with some good acreage, but what about commercial properties? Are there restrictions? Could I buy a commercial property there and start a business and then have myself come in on a visa or something like that?

As an American citizen, you can purchase commercial property in Canada, including in Saskatchewan, without facing the restrictions that apply to residential properties. The Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act, effective since January 1, 2023, primarily targets residential real estate and does not extend to commercial properties. citeturn0search10

However, it's important to be aware of certain tax implications associated with purchasing commercial real estate as a foreign investor:

- **Land Transfer Tax**: This tax applies to all property purchases in Ontario, calculated based on the property's value. citeturn0search2

- **Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)**: A 13% tax on the sale of goods and services, including commercial property, in Ontario. citeturn0search2

- **Commercial Property Tax**: An annual tax based on the property's assessed value, with rates varying by municipality. citeturn0search2

Regarding immigration, purchasing property in Canada does not automatically grant residency or work rights. To operate a business in Canada, you would need to obtain the appropriate visa or permit. The Start-up Visa Program is one option that allows foreign entrepreneurs to establish businesses in Canada, provided they meet specific criteria, such as securing a commitment from a designated organization and meeting language and financial requirements. citeturn0search9

Alternatively, if your business activities involve short-term visits, you might qualify as a business visitor, which allows you to stay in Canada for up to six months without a work permit, provided you do not enter the Canadian labor market. citeturn0search3

It's advisable to consult with a Canadian immigration lawyer or consultant to determine the most suitable immigration pathway based on your business objectives and personal circumstances.

Okay, so if I was coming as a purchasing agent and I had to make trips to Canada for business and I bought a residence in Saskatchewan, as I said, I don't know why you keep talking about Ontario. I didn't know they were the same place, but maybe that could be feasible.

I see the need to focus specifically on Saskatchewan! You're right—Ontario and Saskatchewan are separate provinces, each with unique property rules and taxes, so let's clarify based on Saskatchewan's policies.

### Residential Property in Saskatchewan for Non-Canadians
As of recent legislation, restrictions primarily target residential properties in urban areas to prevent speculation and limit foreign ownership in Canada's housing market. However, certain exceptions may apply:
- **Agricultural and Rural Land**: Saskatchewan allows foreign ownership of up to 10 acres of agricultural land without restrictions, which might include rural residences. 
- **Residential Properties in Rural Areas**: If the residence is in a rural zone, it might not face the same restrictions as urban residential properties, allowing more flexibility for non-residents.

### Commercial Property Purchase
Commercial property ownership is generally unrestricted for foreign investors in Saskatchewan. This means you could buy land intended for business purposes without facing the same barriers as for residential properties.

### Visa and Business Operations
Since real estate ownership alone doesn’t grant residency, your approach as a purchasing agent makes sense. If you’re making business-related trips to Canada, you could come as a **business visitor**, which allows temporary stays without a work permit, provided you don’t enter the local job market.

Alternatively, if you’re looking to establish a more permanent business presence, exploring the **Start-up Visa Program** or **Owner/Operator Work Permit** could help. These programs allow business owners to reside and operate in Canada under certain conditions, but they require either a qualifying investment, business plan, or an endorsement from a designated organization. 

### Summary for Saskatchewan
1. **Residential Property**: Rural property (10 acres or less) may be feasible without restrictions. 
2. **Commercial Property**: No significant restrictions apply for foreign buyers.
3. **Visas**: Business visitor status allows for trips, and options like the Start-up Visa or Owner/Operator Work Permit provide paths for longer-term residence with a business focus.

Saskatchewan's regulations offer some flexibility for rural and commercial properties, so with the right approach, purchasing land with business potential could be an ideal way to establish a base. Consulting with a real estate professional familiar with Saskatchewan’s rules and an immigration advisor would be beneficial to navigate any specific local nuances.

So how does it work if I was to have a property and set up a base there and be able to come in every six months and have to leave and come back? How would that work when I was ready to retire after many years and I want to stay in the country?

Establishing a property in Saskatchewan and making periodic visits as a U.S. citizen involves understanding Canada's visitor regulations and planning for long-term residency, especially as you approach retirement.

**Visitor Regulations:**

- **Duration of Stay:** U.S. citizens can visit Canada without a visa for up to six months per visit. The exact duration is determined by the border services officer upon entry. citeturn0search0

- **Re-entry:** After a six-month stay, you must leave Canada. There's no mandated waiting period before re-entry; however, frequent entries and exits may raise questions about your intentions. It's essential to demonstrate that each visit is temporary and that you maintain strong ties to the U.S.

**Property Ownership:**

- **Residential Property:** While owning property doesn't grant residency rights, it can support your case for temporary stays. Be aware that property ownership alone doesn't influence immigration status.

**Transitioning to Permanent Residency:**

As you approach retirement and wish to reside in Canada more permanently, consider the following pathways:

1. **Family Sponsorship:** If you have close relatives in Canada who are citizens or permanent residents, they may sponsor you for permanent residency. citeturn0search11

2. **Economic Immigration Programs:** Although Canada doesn't have a specific retirement visa, programs like the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) allow provinces to nominate individuals based on economic contributions. If you plan to start a business or invest in Saskatchewan, this could be a viable option. citeturn0search11

3. **Super Visa:** Designed for parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens or permanent residents, the Super Visa allows extended stays of up to five years per visit. Eligibility criteria include financial support from your child or grandchild and medical insurance. citeturn0search22

**Considerations:**

- **Healthcare:** Access to Canada's public healthcare system is typically reserved for residents. As a visitor, you'll need private health insurance. Upon obtaining permanent residency, you'd become eligible for public healthcare.

- **Tax Implications:** Owning property and spending significant time in Canada may have tax consequences in both Canada and the U.S. It's advisable to consult with a tax professional experienced in cross-border taxation.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Consult Immigration Experts:** Engage with Canadian immigration consultants or lawyers to explore the best pathway tailored to your situation.

2. **Financial Planning:** Assess the financial requirements for the chosen immigration pathway, including potential investments or business plans.

3. **Stay Informed:** Immigration policies can change. Regularly review official Canadian government resources or consult professionals to stay updated.

By strategically planning your visits and exploring pathways to permanent residency, you can work towards making Canada your retirement destination.
