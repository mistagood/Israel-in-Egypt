Explain to me the verses about if Noah, Job, and Lot were in that city, why they couldn't save only themselves.

The verses you're referring to come from Ezekiel 14:14 and 14:20, where God speaks through the prophet Ezekiel about the inevitability of judgment upon a sinful nation. In these passages, God declares that even if righteous men like Noah, Daniel (sometimes understood as Job), and Lot were present in a city destined for destruction due to its wickedness, they would only be able to save themselves through their righteousness; they would not be able to save their sons, daughters, or anyone else.

Here is the context and a deeper exploration of these verses:

**Ezekiel 14:14 and 14:20:**

> "Even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign Lord."

These verses are part of a broader message from God to the elders of Israel, who came to inquire of the Lord through Ezekiel. However, God is displeased with the idolatry and rebellion of the people and warns of the coming judgment.

**Key Points to Consider:**

1. **Symbol of Ultimate Righteousness:**
   Noah, Daniel, and Job are referenced as epitomes of righteousness. Each of these men, in their respective narratives, was known for their piety and obedience to God amidst corruption, trials, and destruction:
   - **Noah** was saved from the Flood due to his righteousness in a corrupt world.
   - **Daniel (or Job, as understood in some interpretations)** was known for his steadfast faith in God despite severe trials and personal suffering.
   - **Lot** (not directly mentioned but inferred in your question) was spared from the destruction of Sodom because of his righteousness, though he could not save the city or his sons-in-law.

2. **Individual Responsibility:**
   The repeated refrain that only the individual (Noah, Daniel, or Job) would be saved underscores the theme of personal responsibility before God. These verses emphasize that even the intercession of the most righteous would not be enough to avert judgment from a sinful nation or people. The message is clear: each person is accountable for their actions, and no one else's righteousness can shield them from divine judgment if they continue in wickedness.

3. **Limits of Intercession:**
   God is pointing out that there is a limit to intercession. Even though the Bible often portrays intercession by righteous individuals as powerful (such as Moses interceding for Israel), Ezekiel 14 indicates that in certain circumstances, such as entrenched rebellion and idolatry, God's judgment is set. This serves as a warning that relying on the righteousness of a few (or the prayers of others) is not enough to avoid the consequences of one's own actions.

4. **God's Impartial Justice:**
   These verses also illustrate God's impartial justice. The mention of Noah, Daniel, and Job reinforces that not even the merits of the greatest human righteousness can shield others from judgment if they themselves do not turn from their ways. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God judges each individual based on their heart and actions, rather than the righteousness of others.

5. **Context of Ezekiel's Prophecy:**
   Ezekiel is prophesying during a time when the people of Judah are in exile or on the brink of it due to their continued rebellion against God. The elders of Israel are being warned that they cannot rely on their identity, heritage, or the intercession of a few righteous individuals to save them from the coming judgment. Instead, they must repent and turn back to God.

**Conclusion:**

The message in Ezekiel 14 is stark: righteousness is personal, and divine judgment is sure upon those who persist in wickedness. The verses about Noah, Daniel, and Job serve as a powerful reminder that while the righteousness of a few may save themselves, it cannot substitute for the repentance and righteousness required from each person before God. This reflects a broader biblical principle that each person must "work out their own salvation with fear and trembling" (Philippians 2:12), highlighting personal responsibility in the face of divine judgment.
