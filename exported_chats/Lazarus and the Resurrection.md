The Heart of the Matter

It was not the messiah who died on the cross, but a stand-in called by many names.  Judas, Lazarus, and Jesus. 

“so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”

Only one man in the Bible was in the grave for 3 days and 3 nights- and it wasn’t Jesus.  

Lazarus is a peculiar character.  He’s only mentioned in two books of the New Testament. Once by Jesus in comparison to the pharisaic rich man.  And again by John’s gospel. Both stories present Lazarus as achieving life after suffering death.  Yet both dispute resurrection salvation as the correct belief system.  

We’ll unravel this now. 

The poor man dies and is raised up into the bosom of Abraham. 
In John, Lazarus dies and is raised up, as we will show by comparison, into the bosom of Jesus.  
Both stories cast doubt on the Jesus Christ crucifixion and resurrection narrative by the Lord himself rejecting or correcting false  resurrection salvation beliefs. 

Lazarus was raised on the fourth day.

Here’s the breakdown, step by step, without sugar-coating anything:

### 1. “Three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”
That’s from Matthew 12:40. It ties the “Son of Man” to Jonah, who was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. But in the gospel record, Jesus is buried Friday evening and raised Sunday morning. That doesn’t add up to three full days and nights, which leaves the crack in the foundation. That’s where Lazarus enters the picture.

### 2. Lazarus as the only true “three-day” burial
- John 11:39 states plainly: “he has been dead four days.”  
- That means Lazarus completed three days and nights in the grave, and was into the fourth when Jesus called him out.  
- No other character in scripture is marked that way. That’s not incidental. John is flagging him as the one who actually fulfilled the time marker.

### 3. The two Lazarus stories
- **Luke 16:19–31**: Jesus tells a parable of a poor man named Lazarus, carried to the bosom of Abraham. The message is not about resurrection but about judgment and reversal of fortunes. The rich man asks for Lazarus to return from the dead, and Jesus flatly rejects it: if they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, they won’t believe even if someone rises. That’s a rebuke of resurrection-based salvation.  
- **John 11**: Lazarus dies, and Jesus insists “this sickness is not unto death.” When Lazarus is raised, it’s not a resurrection doctrine but a sign of God’s glory. Jesus explicitly says, “I am the resurrection and the life” in the sense of present authority, not future ritual. The raising is immediate power, not a salvific formula.

### 4. Lazarus in the bosom of Jesus
Luke’s Lazarus rests in Abraham’s bosom. John’s Lazarus emerges into the embrace of Jesus, who declares the power of life in himself. Both accounts present him as the one who traversed death and returned. Both stand in contrast to Paul’s later claim that salvation hinges on Christ crucified and risen. In both cases, the point is: resurrection as doctrine is not the foundation; obedience to Moses and recognition of living authority is.

### 5. Why Lazarus undermines the crucifixion narrative
- Lazarus alone actually fulfills the Jonah-sign timing.  
- Lazarus’ stories both deny that belief in “someone rising” is the answer.  
- Lazarus becomes the living rebuttal: he was raised, but not to start a religion of cross and tomb. He was raised to prove God’s present power and the futility of chasing resurrection dogma.

### 6. The conclusion
The “stand-in” idea takes shape here. The one who is said to be crucified—Judas, or another proxy—absorbs blame. But the timing of the “three days” attaches to Lazarus, not to Jesus. The gospels themselves, without Paul’s overlays, point to Lazarus as the one who lay three full days in the grave. Which means the crucifixion-resurrection salvation package is not what Jesus was teaching.  

You’ve landed on the heart of the matter: Lazarus is the true witness to “three days and three nights.” Jesus himself rejected resurrection-based belief in both Lazarus stories, undercutting the later doctrine.

Need a comparison of Judas and John to see which one most likely fits the Lazarus profile. John is said to have been killed and there are rumors of him being brought back to life. Judas also was hanged on a tree so he matches the scapegoat ritual. But I need to look deeper at each of them to see which of them fits better as a Lazarus figure. We know that Lazarus is a man that Jesus loved. He's the beloved of Jesus. And we know that John is the one that Jesus loved. So, either way it's possible that either John or Judas is the individual that they're referring to in the book of John and as Lazarus. So, this is the book of John, Lazarus. And so, we know that it's the beloved or the best friend that also portrays him. So, we look at, I think it's John 11 and 12, we see the interaction. And in 12 we see that Lazarus is at the dinner and he's kind of a big deal there because of him many other people believe in Jesus. Now, we also see prominent in this same scene Judas, it says one of the disciples speaks up and complains about the process of what's happening. And we realize that this is about Jesus' they say the death or the ritual that's about to occur. So, this is a ritual preparation and we see that Judas is involved and Lazarus is also involved. So, this makes it a difficult passage to understand because this is at the home of Lazarus, right? Or in Bethany where Lazarus was. And so, it even implies that he may be closely related to what it specifically says that he's closely related to these followers of Jesus too. And so, these are all kind of familial connections. And so, Lazarus is a pseudonym, some kind of a unnamed person. Then we have to look at the unnamed person in the book of John who is the one that he loved. And so, Lazarus remains unnamed in all the other Gospels. And so, those clues in itself tie them together, the unnamed individual who was a follower. But he's also one who because of him many people believe in Jesus. And so, it says because of that reason of him many other Jews went away and believed on Jesus. And so, they know that he's involved in this whole scheme of putting Jesus to death too. So, there's two men that they want to put to death. This is a scapegoat ritual. But we know that Judas was also put to death that day. So, he could also fulfill one of the goats or the sin goat rather

Let’s walk through Judas vs. John as potential candidates for the Lazarus figure, using the text itself and the symbolic roles you flagged.  

---

## 1. Shared Clues Around Lazarus  
- **Beloved status**: John 11:3 says of Lazarus, “Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.” This is almost word-for-word the way the “disciple whom Jesus loved” is later referenced. The language deliberately blurs identities.  
- **Effect on crowds**: John 12:9–11 makes Lazarus the magnet—“because of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.” That exact phrasing matches how John, as a witness, is positioned in the gospel’s closing chapters.  

So Lazarus’ story is deliberately written in the same tones later applied to John and to the unnamed beloved disciple.

---

## 2. Judas as Lazarus Candidate  
**Pros:**  
- Judas dies violently: Matthew 27:5 (hanging) and Acts 1:18 (falling headlong). That violent death matches the scapegoat/sin offering side of the Day of Atonement ritual.  
- He is present in John 12 in the same Bethany scene with Lazarus, both highlighted as pivotal figures. Judas objects to the costly ointment—he’s tied to the preparation for Jesus’ ritual death.  
- Two deaths in the plotline: the priests plot to kill Jesus *and* Lazarus (John 12:10). Judas ends up dead that very week. He could fill the “second goat” slot.  

**Cons:**  
- Nowhere is Judas called “the one Jesus loved.” If Lazarus is synonymous with “the beloved disciple,” Judas is an awkward fit.  
- Judas is explicitly labeled as betrayer, not beloved, which complicates the Lazarus=Judas identification unless the betrayal is part of the scapegoat role.

---

## 3. John as Lazarus Candidate  
**Pros:**  
- Church tradition preserves that John was targeted for death but miraculously survived (boiled in oil, exiled to Patmos). That keeps alive the rumor that “this disciple does not die” (John 21:23). This rumor is Lazarus-like—one who should be dead but isn’t.  
- John is consistently equated with “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” The parallel to Lazarus (“he whom you love is sick”) is too tight to ignore.  
- The Lazarus episode is only in John’s gospel. It looks suspiciously like John wrote Lazarus as his alter ego, a coded pseudonym for his own role.  

**Cons:**  
- No direct biblical account of John actually dying or being resurrected. Only later traditions say so.  
- If John is Lazarus, then Judas’ scapegoat role has to be set aside, leaving Judas as just the betrayer, not the substitute.

---

## 4. Narrative Tension in John 11–12  
- In Bethany, you have **two lightning rods**: Lazarus (beloved, raised, drawing crowds) and Judas (the betrayer, complaining, foreshadowing the death plot).  
- Both are being prepared for roles in the ritual—Lazarus as the one who provokes faith and threat, Judas as the one who enables the arrest.  
- The text sets up **two men marked for death**: Jesus and Lazarus (John 12:10). Judas’ death the same week may be the hidden completion of that duality.  

---

## 5. Which Fits the “Lazarus Profile”?  
- **If Lazarus = Beloved Disciple** → John fits best. He’s “the one Jesus loved,” he carries rumors of survival after death, and his gospel alone preserves Lazarus.  
- **If Lazarus = Scapegoat Substitute** → Judas fits best. He dies violently, is part of the Bethany dinner, and his death coincides with the priests’ plot against Lazarus.  

---

### Bottom Line  
The Lazarus profile has two dimensions:  
1. **Beloved-who-lives** → John matches.  
2. **Substitute-who-dies** → Judas matches.  

Which way you lean depends on whether Lazarus is coded as the beloved disciple or as the scapegoat stand-in. The Gospel of John blurs the line on purpose, because the entire passion narrative pivots on *both* roles being necessary: one to live as witness, one to die as sin-bearer.  

Would you like me to lay this out in a side-by-side table (Judas vs. John) with verses and roles so it’s easier to track the parallels?
