# John the Baptist Inquiry



---



---

When John was baptizing, did they come to him and ask him, are you that prophet 

---

Yes, in the Gospel of John, when John the Baptist was baptizing, the priests and Levites sent from Jerusalem came to him and asked, "Who are you?" They inquired further, asking if he was the Messiah, Elijah, or "that prophet" (John 1:19-21). This reference to "that prophet" points to a figure prophesied in Deuteronomy 18:15, where Moses speaks of God raising up a prophet like him from among the people. John the Baptist denied being the Messiah, Elijah, or that prophet, clarifying his role as the one preparing the way for the Lord, citing Isaiah 40:3.

What's his response?

When John the Baptist was asked if he was "that prophet," his response was clear. In **John 1:21**, after being asked if he was the Messiah, Elijah, or the prophet, he replied:

- **To the question of being the Messiah:** He said, "I am not the Messiah."
- **To the question of being Elijah:** He said, "I am not."
- **To the question of being 'the Prophet':** He answered, "No."

Later, when they pressed him on why he was baptizing if he was none of these figures, John responded by pointing to his role as the forerunner of Christ. He quoted Isaiah 40:3, saying, **“I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”** (John 1:23).

John the Baptist was making it clear that he was not the expected Prophet like Moses, but was instead the one preparing the way for the true Messiah.
