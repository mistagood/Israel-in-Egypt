John 6:66
This verse is crucial in understanding the Bible. It is Peter’s confession and his connection to the tribe of Benjamin. Here in verse 66. 66 represents the mark of the beast and 600 represents the 600 rebels from the tribe of Benjamin. 66 represents rebellion because it is the splitting of the 12 tribes into two parts. So the dividing of the tribes is represented by rebellion and the one who departs and leads others from following the anointed one. The entire passage refers to Peter. Ironically, parenthetical inserts are the only links to Judas as the intended disciple whom Jesus was speaking about. These are erroneous and says Judas has Norway been introduced to the context, and Peter himself is the conversant. The insert is an alarm for us to investigate further why it has been put there. How does it miss lead us in the narrative? By inserting that this passage is about Judas, the addition to the text, supports other narratives, which point to Judas as an offender. Yet in actuality this passage goes on to identify Peter as the devil Jesus is referring to. In the passage, Jesus rebukes Peter by name and calls him Satan. It’s highly unlikely that Jesus was speaking of Judas at this point, and then a few verses later names Peter as Satan as well within the same conversation. The insert erroneously presumes to know what Jesus was thinking, although there is no context for the statement having been directed at a non character like Judas at this point. Although there is evidence that Jesus knew who did not believe since he later calls Peter the devil. It seems more likely that Jesus if predicting doubt would see the impending things of Satan that Peter had in mind as he later reveals. It’s unlikely that Jesus was referring to two disciples as the devil. He specifically said I chose you 12 and “ONE of you is the devil”. A few verses later he tells us which of the disciples is the devil by name, and it’s Peter.

The interpretation of biblical verses like John 6:66 can vary widely among scholars, theologians, and readers due to the complex nature of biblical texts, symbolism, and historical context. The specific interpretation you're referencing appears to be a unique perspective on this verse and its connection to Peter and the tribe of Benjamin, as well as the symbolism of the number 66 and its relation to the concept of rebellion and the division of the twelve tribes of Israel.

In traditional biblical scholarship, John 6:66 is generally understood as a moment where many of Jesus' followers turn away from him after finding his teachings difficult to accept. This verse is often not directly connected to Peter's confession, nor is it commonly associated with the tribe of Benjamin or the specific numerological interpretations you mentioned.

The connection of 66 to the mark of the beast, typically associated with the number 666 in the Book of Revelation, is also a unique interpretation. In most biblical studies, these numbers are not directly linked.

The portrayal of Peter in this interpretation, especially the assertion that he is referred to as "the devil" by Jesus, is also not a widely accepted view. While Peter does have moments of doubt and denial in the Gospels, he is traditionally seen as a leading figure among Jesus' disciples and the early Christian church.

The idea of parenthetical inserts influencing the narrative and potentially leading to misinterpretations is an intriguing perspective on biblical text analysis. This approach involves examining how additions or interpretations by later editors or translators might affect the understanding of the original text.

In any case, it's important to approach such interpretations with an understanding of their unique context within the broader spectrum of biblical scholarship and theology. Different denominations, scholars, and cultures might have varying views on these topics, and each interpretation contributes to the rich tapestry of biblical analysis and understanding.
