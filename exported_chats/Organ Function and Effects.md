# Organ Function and Effects

What's the job or the major jobs of the liver, the pancreas, and the kidneys? How does fasting, water, and sugar affect them?

Great question. Here's a breakdown of the major jobs of the **liver**, **pancreas**, and **kidneys**, and how **fasting**, **water**, and **sugar** affect each organ:

---

### **LIVER**  
**Major Jobs:**
- **Detoxification:** Filters and breaks down toxins from blood (drugs, alcohol, byproducts of metabolism).
- **Metabolism:** Processes nutrients from food; converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage.
- **Bile Production:** Helps digest fats.
- **Storage:** Stores vitamins, iron, and glycogen.
- **Synthesis:** Makes blood proteins (like albumin) and clotting factors.

**Effects of:**
- **Fasting:** The liver breaks down glycogen into glucose (glycogenolysis) to maintain blood sugar. Over time, it begins producing ketones from fat (ketogenesis).
- **Water:** Hydration helps the liver function more efficiently in filtering and processing toxins.
- **Sugar:** Excess sugar is converted into fat in the liver (lipogenesis), which can lead to **fatty liver disease** over time.

### **PANCREAS**  
**Major Jobs:**
- **Endocrine function:** Produces insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugar.
- **Exocrine function:** Produces digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, protease) released into the small intestine.

**Effects of:**
- **Fasting:** Insulin levels drop; glucagon rises to stimulate the liver to release glucose.
- **Water:** Supports enzyme function and helps transport nutrients in digestion.
- **Sugar:** High sugar intake overworks insulin production. Chronic overload can lead to **insulin resistance** and **type 2 diabetes**.

### **KIDNEYS**  
**Major Jobs:**
- **Filtration:** Clean the blood by removing waste, drugs, and excess substances.
- **Fluid Balance:** Regulate water and electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, etc.).
- **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Via renin-angiotensin system.
- **Red Blood Cell Production:** Produce erythropoietin (EPO) to stimulate RBC production in bone marrow.

**Effects of:**
- **Fasting:** Kidneys help maintain electrolyte balance during periods of no food intake.
- **Water:** Critical for kidney function—**dehydration strains** kidneys and can lead to kidney stones or failure over time.
- **Sugar:** Excess sugar increases the risk of **diabetic nephropathy**, damaging kidney blood vessels over time.
