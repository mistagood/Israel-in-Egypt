What does Elishima mean?

The name **Elishama** (אֱלִישָׁמָע) is Hebrew and appears in the Bible several times, usually as the name of a leader or descendant within Israel.  

Its meaning is straightforward:  

- **Eli** (אֱלִי) = “my God”  
- **Shama** (שָׁמָע) = “has heard” or “hears”  

So the name translates to **“My God has heard”** or **“God hears”**.  

In the text:  
- One Elishama was a leader of the tribe of Ephraim in Numbers 1:10.  
- Another Elishama is mentioned in the royal line of Judah (1 Chronicles 3:6, 3:23).  

Because of its meaning, the name carries the sense of God responding to prayers or affliction.  

Would you like me to also trace each of the biblical figures named *Elishama* and show how they tie into Ephraim and Judah? That may reveal why the name survived in both tribal houses.

elishama Ammihud

Let’s parse this precisely.

### **Elishama son of Ammihud**
This pairing occurs in **Numbers 1:10**, **Numbers 2:18**, and **Numbers 7:48, 8:4**.  
- Elishama (אֱלִישָׁמָע) = “My God has heard.”  
- Ammihud (עַמִּיהוּד) = from *`ammi`* (my people) + *`hud/hod`* (majesty, glory, splendor).  
   → Meaning: **“My people is glorious”** or **“people of majesty.”**

So **Elishama son of Ammihud** literally reads as:  
**“My God has heard, [son of] my people’s glory.”**

### **Tribal Context**
- He is named as the **prince (nasi’) of Ephraim** in the wilderness generation.  
- Numbers 1:10 – He’s listed as the leader chosen to assist Moses in taking the census.  
- Numbers 2:18 – He leads the camp of Ephraim in the marching order.  
- Numbers 7:48–53 – He brings the tribal offering on the seventh day for the dedication of the tabernacle.  
- Numbers 10:22 – He leads Ephraim’s division when they set out.

### **Lineage Importance**
- Ephraim is Joseph’s younger son, adopted and blessed by Jacob in Genesis 48.  
- Elishama son of Ammihud is effectively the head of Ephraim’s line during the wilderness journey.  
- Through him, Ephraim is represented in the tabernacle dedication and in the order of Israel’s armies.  

In prophetic terms, this is heavy: **Elishama ben Ammihud embodies Ephraim’s leadership as the camp marches toward the promised land.** His name itself reflects covenantal intimacy—“God has heard”—linked to a people called “majestic.”  

Do you want me to chart all appearances of *Ammihud’s line* across scripture (because there are a couple of Ammihuds in different tribes), or just stay focused on this Ephraimite prince?
