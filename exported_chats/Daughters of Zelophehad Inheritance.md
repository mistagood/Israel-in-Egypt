The story of the **Daughters of Zelophehad** is a pivotal moment in biblical law and inheritance, found in **Numbers 27:1-11** and later reaffirmed in **Numbers 36:1-13** and **Joshua 17:3-6**. Their case sets a precedent for inheritance rights in Israel and marks a significant moment where women claim their rightful place within the lineage of their tribe.

### **Who Were the Daughters of Zelophehad?**
The five daughters—**Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah**—belonged to the tribe of **Manasseh**, one of Joseph’s sons. Their father, **Zelophehad**, died in the wilderness, leaving no male heirs. Under the existing inheritance system, only sons received land, meaning their father’s name and property would disappear from their clan.

### **Their Legal Appeal (Numbers 27)**
The daughters boldly approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of Israel to make their case:
1. Their father had **not** died because of rebellion (like Korah’s group), but he left no sons.
2. If inheritance only passed through males, their father’s name would be erased from his tribe.
3. They demanded that their father’s land allotment be **given to them** as an inheritance.

Moses brought their case before Yahweh, and God **ruled in their favor**, declaring:
- **Daughters may inherit their father’s land if there are no sons**.
- This became **law in Israel**, establishing inheritance rights for women under specific conditions.

### **The Follow-Up: Marriage Restrictions (Numbers 36)**
While their case was victorious, another issue arose: If these women married outside their tribe, their inherited land would pass to another tribe, altering tribal boundaries. The leaders of Manasseh protested, leading to another ruling:
- The daughters **must marry within their own tribe** to keep the inheritance within Manasseh.
- They obeyed and married their **paternal cousins**, ensuring that their inheritance remained in the family.

### **Final Confirmation in Joshua 17**
When Israel finally settled in the Promised Land, **Joshua upheld their inheritance**, fulfilling God’s command.

### **Significance of Their Story**
1. **Legal Precedent for Women** – This was one of the first recorded cases where women legally argued for their inheritance rights.
2. **Continuity of Tribal Identity** – The ruling balanced the need for justice with preserving tribal boundaries.
3. **Reaffirmation of Manasseh’s Importance** – Their inheritance is explicitly mentioned again in **Joshua 17**, highlighting Manasseh’s prominence in the land distribution.
4. **Messianic and Prophetic Foreshadowing** – Some interpret this as a **symbol of the grafting in of the 'forgotten' or 'excluded' into inheritance**—a theme seen later in biblical prophecy.

The Daughters of Zelophehad **secured a lasting legacy**, proving that those willing to challenge tradition in righteousness could influence law and divine judgment.
