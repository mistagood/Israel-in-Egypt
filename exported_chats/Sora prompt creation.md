Creating this Sora prompt based on the picture. In a dramatic Marvel Universe type cinematic scene, Black Adam and Eve encounter temptation in the garden.

Here’s a polished **Sora prompt** you can use based on the image and your description:

**Prompt:**  
*A dramatic, cinematic Marvel Universe–style scene set in a shadowed, otherworldly Garden of Eden. Black Adam stands as a towering, muscular figure in his dark suit emblazoned with a lightning bolt, his expression stern and unyielding. Beside him is Eve, powerful and radiant, with short silver hair and a piercing gaze. She holds a glowing apple in her hand, symbol of temptation. The atmosphere is heavy with tension and mythic grandeur, light and shadow cutting across their bodies as if from divine judgment. In the background, twisted branches and hanging fruit frame the scene like a living tapestry. Hyper-detailed, photorealistic, high-contrast chiaroscuro lighting, epic cinematic tone, dramatic composition, Marvel superhero movie poster aesthetic.*  

Do you want me to refine this more toward **a photorealistic live-action look**, or toward **stylized illustrated concept art** (like a Marvel comics panel)?

No, it's for a video. I don't want it to be dark like that picture, though. I want it to be like I described. Also, that's Eve, the rapper, and Dwayne Johnson, the rock, who plays Black Adam, so it's Black Adam and Eve. Get it?

Perfect — I see exactly what you’re going for now. You want a **cinematic Sora video prompt** that clearly shows the concept: *Black Adam and Eve (the rapper Eve)* together in a Marvel-style Garden of Eden scene, but brighter and more epic than the moody image you shared.  

Here’s a refined version tailored for video:

**Sora Prompt (Video):**  
*A dramatic, cinematic Marvel Universe–style scene in the Garden of Eden. The rapper Eve, with her signature short platinum-blonde hair and bold presence, stands holding a glowing apple in her hand, symbolizing temptation. Beside her towers Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as Black Adam, in his black superhero suit with the glowing lightning bolt on his chest, his expression powerful and watchful. The garden around them is lush, vibrant, and illuminated with golden, ethereal light filtering through the trees, with fruit hanging in the branches. The tone is epic, mythic, and cinematic — like a Marvel movie trailer moment. Smooth camera motion, wide-angle establishing shots and close-ups, high-definition, photorealistic, heroic and dramatic atmosphere.*

Would you like me to structure this in **sequences** (shot-by-shot cues like “establishing shot, close-up, pan across the apple” etc.) so it plays out like a mini-trailer, or keep it as one continuous scene description?

Does this violate SORA's policies?

No, this does not violate Sora’s policies.  

Here’s why:  

- **Depictions of public figures** like *Dwayne Johnson (The Rock)* or *Eve (the rapper)* are allowed when they’re being used in clear, creative, transformative contexts — such as parody, satire, fan art, or imaginative mashups (*“Black Adam and Eve”* in a Marvel-style Garden of Eden is clearly a playful, transformative remix).  
- **Religious imagery** (Adam, Eve, Garden of Eden, temptation) is also fine as long as it’s not being used to harass or disparage people. Creative reinterpretations and symbolic re-imaginings are permitted.  
- **Tone and style** (cinematic, Marvel-like, superhero, mythic) is all squarely within creative storytelling and fan-art territory.  
- **Not harmful or misleading**: You’re not using their likenesses to impersonate, scam, or spread misinformation — you’re creating a fantasy/video-art concept.  

So you’re totally in the clear.  

If you’d like, I can phrase the **final Sora prompt** in a way that emphasizes the *parody/satire* angle more strongly — that usually makes it even more safely within policy boundaries. Want me to lock it in that way?
