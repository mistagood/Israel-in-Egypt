**Hebrew (MT):**  

22 יְהוָ֣ה קָ֭נָנִי רֵאשִׁ֣ית דַּרְכּ֑וֹ קֶ֖דֶם מִפְעָלָ֣יו מֵאָֽז׃  
23 מֵעוֹלָ֣ם נִסַּ֑כְתִּי מֵרֹ֖אשׁ מִקַּדְמֵי־אָֽרֶץ׃  
24 בְּאֵין־תְּהֹמ֥וֹת חֹלָ֑לְתִּי בְּאֵ֥ין מַ֝עְיָנ֗וֹת נִכְבַּדֵּי־מָֽיִם׃  
25 בְּטֶ֣רֶם הָרִ֣ים הָטְבָּ֑עוּ לִפְנֵ֥י גְבָע֗וֹת חֹולָֽלְתִּי׃  
26 עַד־לֹ֣א עָשָׂ֣ה אֶ֭רֶץ וְחוּצ֑וֹת וְרֹ֖אשׁ עַפְרוֹת תֵּבֵֽל׃  
27 בְּהָ֤֘כִינ֨וֹ שָׁמַ֗יִם שָׁ֫ם אָ֥נִי בְּח֣וּקוֹ ח֖וּג עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם׃  
28 בְּאַמְּצ֣וֹ שְׁחָקִ֣ים מִמָּ֑עַל בַּעֲז֖וֹז עִינ֣וֹת תְּהֽוֹם׃  
29 בְּשׂוּמ֤וֹ לַיָּם֙ ח֣וֹק֔וֹ וּמַ֕יִם לֹ֖א יַעַבְר֣וּ פִ֑יו בְּחֻקּ֖וֹ מוֹסְדֵ֣י אָֽרֶץ׃  
30 וָאֶֽהְיֶ֥ה אֶצְל֗וֹ אָ֫מ֥וֹן וָֽאֶהְיֶ֥ה שַׁעֲשֻׁעִ֗ים יוֹם֣ יוֹם֑ מְשַׂחֶ֥קֶת לְפָנָ֖יו בְּכָל־עֵֽת׃

**English (Literal):**  

22 YHWH possessed me at the beginning of His way, before His works of old.  
23 From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.  
24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water.  
25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth;  
26 While He had not yet made the earth and the fields, nor the first dust of the world.  
27 When He prepared the heavens, I was there; when He drew a circle upon the face of the deep;  
28 When He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong;  
29 When He set for the sea its limit so that the waters would not transgress His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth;  
30 Then I was beside Him, as a master workman; and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him.

If you want, I can also give you the **Hebrew word-by-word breakdown**—including roots and meanings—since this passage contains several rare or debated terms like **קָנָנִי** (*qanani*, "possessed/created me") and **אָמ֑וֹן** (*amon*, "master craftsman" or "nursling"). That would help clarify how the ancient text is understood in different translations.
