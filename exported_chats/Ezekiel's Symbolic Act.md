Yes, it is a fact that the "Son of Man" took his burden upon his shoulder, dug through a wall, and went out at dusk, as described in the Book of Ezekiel in the Bible.

In Ezekiel 12:1-12, the prophet Ezekiel, referred to as the "Son of Man," is instructed by God to perform a symbolic act. God commands Ezekiel to pack his belongings as if going into exile and to dig through the wall of his house in the sight of the people, then carry his baggage on his shoulder and go out at dusk. This act symbolizes the impending exile of the people of Israel and the captivity they will face. Ezekiel is to act this out to serve as a prophetic sign to the rebellious house of Israel.

The passage emphasizes the burdens of exile and captivity, showcasing a vivid, prophetic gesture meant to communicate the seriousness of the consequences that await the people due to their disobedience. This symbolic act can be seen as both a literal performance by Ezekiel and a broader metaphor for spiritual and physical exile.
