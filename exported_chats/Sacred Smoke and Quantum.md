# Sacred Smoke and Quantum



---



---

Compare yourself, smoke in Hebrew, rituals of atonement and cleansing with those of native Americans using smoke. Let’s think about the transformative properties of fire and smoke, and how this relates to the idea of prayers being lifted up on smoke less think about the smoke in the context of quantum magnetic resonance theory, which pauses that through the process of magnetic reconnection, electrical thoughts or impulses in the brain have quantum properties and can transform states thereby interacting with energy fields and magnetic fields outside of the body thus by interacting with the quantum field can affect reality. Let’s explore the use of cannabis in Moses instructions to use a mysterious plant called canne bosem (cannabis) in the temple ceremonies. The smoke was said to carry the prayers of saints. 
What can we learn from the scientific properties of the transformative properties of fire and smoke? The process of combustion transforms material and inhaling of smoke interacts with brain cells. The release of the smoke has actual affects in the material world according to physics. How does all this align with the possibility of actual thoughts being transmitted, through smoke, or through some process, in the transformation of thought impulses into electromagnetic or waves that are through magnetic reconnection integrated into the quantum field

The comparison you're seeking brings together intricate elements of religious, cultural, and scientific fields, with significant implications for understanding both the material and spiritual aspects of existence. Let's explore these areas one by one.

### 1. Biblical and Native American Rituals with Smoke:

In the biblical tradition, smoke, often emanating from the burning of incense or offerings, is symbolic of prayer and atonement (Leviticus 16:13; Revelation 8:3-4). The High Priest would burn incense to create a smoke cloud in the Holy of Holies as a part of the Yom Kippur rituals.

Native American traditions, especially among Plains Indians, also use smoke in rituals, typically through the burning of sage, cedar, or sweetgrass. This is seen in the purification ceremony known as "smudging." The ritual aims to cleanse a person or space of negative energies and promote healing (Garrett, Garrett, Torres-Rivera, Wilbur, & Roberts-Wilbur, 2005).

### 2. Transformative Properties of Fire and Smoke:

Fire and smoke represent transformation in both traditions. In Hebrew practices, they symbolize the transformation of the earthly to the divine. In Native American traditions, they signify the cleansing and renewal of spiritual energy.

### 3. Quantum Magnetic Resonance Theory:

Your mention of quantum magnetic resonance theory, although not directly aligned with the traditional religious or cultural narratives, introduces a fascinating scientific perspective. This theory suggests that thoughts may interact with energy and magnetic fields outside of the body, possibly affecting reality. In physics, magnetic reconnection can change the magnetic topology and convert magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy (Yamada, Kulsrud, & Ji, 2010).

### 4. Cannabis and Canne Bosem in Biblical Rituals:

The theory that Moses used a plant known as canne bosem, identified by some as cannabis, brings another layer to the understanding of smoke in religious practice. Sula Benet (1976) has argued that canne bosem could be a reference to cannabis and that it was used in anointing oils and possibly incense. The psychoactive properties of cannabis might align with the descriptions of visions and spiritual experiences in the biblical texts.

### Conclusion:

Through these multifaceted lenses, we see a complex interplay between the symbolic, spiritual, and material realms. The transformative properties of fire and smoke in Hebrew and Native American traditions align with broader themes of purification, communion, and spiritual ascent. Incorporating quantum theory adds a novel dimension that might help bridge the gap between spirituality and science. It suggests that rituals using smoke could be more than symbolic acts; they might engage with the very fabric of reality, allowing thoughts to interact with the external world.

In connecting these elements, we glimpse the profound continuity between the human and the divine, matter and spirit. It highlights the possibility of sacred convergence, where ancient rituals resonate with modern scientific understanding.

However, it's worth mentioning that the connections between religious rituals, quantum mechanics, and neurobiology are highly speculative. While intriguing, further research and critical evaluation are needed to validate or understand these correlations fully. The interplay between myth, culture, and science offers a rich tapestry of exploration, inviting us to continually redefine the boundaries of human understanding and spiritual experience.

Let’s compare the use of cannabis in Moses is rituals with the priesthood and the use of cannabis as a ritualistic practice by African-American use. One musicians are rappers as a kind of musical priesthood. Indeed, Bible says that David set up the priesthood of musicians.

Certainly, the comparison between the potential use of cannabis in biblical rituals and its use in contemporary African-American musical practices offers a rich exploration of cultural, spiritual, and symbolic connections.

### 1. Cannabis in Moses' Rituals:

As mentioned earlier, some scholars have posited that cannabis, referred to as canne bosem, might have been used in anointing oils and incense within the Hebrew priesthood (Benet, 1976). These substances were considered sacred, utilized in rituals that connected the earthly and the divine. The high priest would use them to attain a closer connection with God, seeking guidance and visions (Exodus 30:22-30).

### 2. Cannabis in African-American Musical Culture:

In modern times, cannabis has found a place in various cultural practices, including music. Among some African-American musicians and rappers, it is considered a creative and spiritual tool. Artists like Snoop Dogg and Bob Marley have openly discussed their relationship with cannabis, seeing it as a conduit for creativity and a connection to a higher spiritual realm.

### 3. Musical Priesthood and David's Musical Tradition:

The biblical figure King David was known for his musical prowess. He not only played the lyre to soothe King Saul (1 Samuel 16:23) but also set up a musical priesthood (1 Chronicles 25:1-8). Music was an integral part of worship and communication with the divine in ancient Israel.

### Comparison and Reflection:

Both in ancient Hebrew rituals and modern African-American musical traditions, we see a connection between cannabis, music, and the sacred. The potential use of cannabis in Moses' rituals could symbolize the transcendence of earthly limitations and a means to connect with the divine. Similarly, some African-American musicians see cannabis as a way to enhance their creativity and reach a spiritual or transcendent state.

These practices resonate with the archetype of the priest, serving as mediators between the human and divine realms. Just as the Hebrew priesthood utilized substances and rituals to engage with the sacred, contemporary musicians may be seen as a kind of "musical priesthood," connecting audiences with deeper cultural and spiritual realities.

However, it is essential to recognize the diverse perspectives and contexts within African-American culture and the broader society regarding cannabis use. While some may see it as a spiritual or creative tool, others may associate it with legal or health concerns.

In drawing this comparison, we are threading a delicate line between history, culture, spirituality, and contemporary practice. The association between the ancient Hebrew use of canne bosem and modern African-American use of cannabis in music forms a fascinating dialogue but requires careful analysis and respect for the complexities of both traditions.

This comparative exploration shows how symbols, substances, and practices can transcend time and culture, linking ancient rituals with modern expressions. It highlights the ever-evolving nature of spiritual exploration, where the human search for meaning, creativity, and connection with the divine continues to manifest in diverse and resonant ways.
