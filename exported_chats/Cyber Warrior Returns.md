analyze this image of me and create a facebook post from the context: i want to say something to the affect "after a long battle, enhanced with upgrades, Meta Good (my cyber persona) contemplates the future of humanity". Basically this is a metaphor for my reintegration into social media after a long absence to complete a degree in education. The battle is not over. I was shortchanged in the degree department. Now my renewed vengance against the system is fueled by my experience within the ed department and now aided by the tools I have garnered in the fight. My hands are now cyber tools. the fight goes to the internet and content creation to teach the people what schools won't. What governments have hiddden, and what we need to know to fight the system. I ttok a long time off social media but now i return as the gunslinger once again

🦾 After a long battle, enhanced with upgrades, Meta Good (my cyber persona) contemplates the future of humanity. 🦿

It's been a while since I last graced the social media battlefield. My absence wasn't in vain; it was a journey deep into the heart of the education system, culminating in a hard-fought degree. The battles fought and lessons learned have forged me anew, and I return, not just as a scholar, but as a warrior equipped with new tools and a renewed vengeance against a system that has long shortchanged us.

My hands are now cyber tools, ready to dive into the digital fray. The fight extends to the internet and content creation, aiming to teach the people what schools won't, expose what governments have hidden, and equip us with the knowledge we need to combat the system. 

I took a long time off social media, but now I return as the gunslinger once again, ready to engage, enlighten, and empower. The battle is far from over, and together, we will shape the future of humanity.

Join me in this quest. The journey continues. 🔥⚔️

This is pretty good, but actually it culminated with me being shortchanged. My ideas were too contrary to their established dogma. I was asked to exit the program early in a stunning twist. They want to give me a MA but the program only offers PhD. But they want me out so they made this exception. It also happens that the advisor I worked with is seeking to publish my work without me. Thats likely why she is having me kicked out of the program (albeit with a masters that isn't offered, but, they say, will keep it from being a waste of my time spent. This is the way they maintain status quo. But this time, I have the internet and social media to continue the fight with my new level of skills. We will out produce and influence using the public platform

It's been a while since I last graced the social media battlefield. My absence wasn't in vain; it was a journey deep into the heart of the education system. In a stunning twist, my ideas proved too contrary to their established dogma, and I was asked to exit the program early. Despite the PhD program's offerings, they decided to grant me a Master's degree—an exception made just to push me out while claiming it wasn’t a waste of my time.

To add to the betrayal, my advisor is seeking to publish my work without me, another tactic to maintain the status quo. But this time, I have the internet and social media to continue the fight. With my new level of skills and determination, I will out-produce and influence using public platforms. 

My hands are now cyber tools, ready to dive into the digital fray. The fight extends to the internet and content creation, aiming to teach the people what schools won't, expose what governments have hidden, and equip us with the knowledge we need to combat the system.

I took a long time off social media, but now I return as the gunslinger once again, ready to engage, enlighten, and empower. The battle is far from over, and together, we will shape the future of humanity.

lets give another go: 🦾 After a long and arduous battle against the Machine, Meta Good, enhanced with upgrades and secret tech, contemplates the future of humanity. 🦿

It's been a while since I last graced the social media battlefield. My absence wasn't in vain; it was a journey deep into the heart of the education system. My research at UCLA's URBAN SCHOOLING centered parent narratives in the special education setting to highlight the gaps in educating OUR youth with AUTISM. In a stunning twist, 2 Master's Degrees (in African American Studies and Urban Schooling) have only enhanced my understanding of a system broken beyond repair, designed as a prison partnership program. 

The most discouraging part is that when you speak against it, the educators attacked you. From a spook who sat by the door, beware the AGENDA.
