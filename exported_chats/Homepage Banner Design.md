Let's design a **large graphic banner** for the homepage that aligns with the **theme and mission** of the *Ten Lost Tribes* website. Here are some key elements to consider:

### **Concept & Theme**
- **Title:** *Uncovering the Truth of the Lost Tribes*
- **Subtext:** *Historical Research | Identity Restoration | Prophetic Understanding*
- **Imagery:**
  - **Ancient Maps** overlaying a **modern world map** to show the dispersion of the tribes.
  - **Tribal Symbols** or ancient **Hebrew letters** to convey the deep historical roots.
  - **A dramatic sky** (stormy or celestial) representing **revelation and awakening**.
  - **A silhouette of a path or road** leading forward, symbolizing the search for truth.
  - **Prophetic symbolism**, such as **a shofar, burning scrolls, or an open book**.

### **Design Elements**
- **Color Palette:**
  - **Deep gold & black** (symbolizing wisdom and mystery)
  - **Dark blues & purples** (historical and celestial themes)
  - **Earthy tones** (connection to ancient lands)
- **Typography:**
  - A **bold, ancient-style font** for the title.
  - A clean, readable font for the subtext.
- **Style:**
  - **Layered textures** for a rich, historical feel.
  - **Glowing edges or light rays** to symbolize **spiritual revelation**.
  - Subtle **motion blur effects** to create a sense of movement.
