# Paul as False Prophet



---



---

Reiterate my last response in the chain.: “According to the word of the Lord WE who are still alive”.  

Paul said ‘we’, meaning he and his followers.  

He is dead. This is clearly a false prophecy.  

If you compare this to Deuteronomy 18:22 you will see that any man who specifically says that “by the word of the Lord” something will happen and it doesn’t happen, has not gotten that word from the Lord. 


If you fear Paul, a mere man, then you can’t hear and see what the scriptures are saying about him. 

Jacob said he’s a ravenous wolf that divides his flock. Gen 49

Jesus said he’s a false prophet that comes in sheep clothing, but is really a ravenous wolf.  Matt 7:15

The only two places you see the phrase ‘ravenous wolf’ in the entire Bible is talking about Benjamin and the false prophet and what tree he come from (thorns). Matt 7

Now would God choose a wolf to lead his flock? No, but Jesus said, “Peter feed my sheep.”  

That makes Peter a hired hand (since he’s feeding Jesus’ sheep and not his own).  

But when the wolf comes what does the hired hand do???

Run, Peter, Run!! 😂 
(now we celebrate Easter with bunnies and Peter Cottontail!)

But if you fear the Lord, you recognize Paul as the Ravenous Wolf- of Benjamin. That boasting “Benjamite of Benjamites”. ‘Prince of Sinners’. —But you’re not afraid of him. The scriptures tells you, you should not fear that prophet. 

Deuteronomy 18
However, any prophet who arrogantly speaks a word in my name that I haven’t commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods—that prophet must die. Now, you might be wondering, How will we know which word God hasn’t spoken? Here’s the answer: The prophet who speaks in the Lord’s name and the thing doesn’t happen or come about—that’s the word the Lord hasn’t spoken. That prophet spoke arrogantly. Don’t be afraid of him. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.18.20,Deut.18.21,Deut.18.22&version=CEB

Sounds like Paul cousin.

1 Thessalonians 4:15-16 addresses the topic of the resurrection of believers in Christ and the hope Christians have regarding those who have died. Here’s a breakdown of these verses:**Verse 15**: "According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep." This verse emphasizes that Paul is sharing a revelation he received from the Lord regarding the second coming of Christ. He reassures the Thessalonian believers that those who are still alive at Christ's return will not have an advantage over those who have already died (referred to as "fallen asleep"). **Verse 16**: "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first." Here, Paul describes the manner of Christ’s second coming. It will be a dramatic event marked by a loud command, the voice of an archangel, and the trumpet of God. Importantly, he notes that the dead in Christ (those who believed in Jesus and have passed away) will be resurrected first. Overall, these verses offer comfort to believers by reaffirming the promise of resurrection and the hope of being reunited with loved ones who have died in faith when Christ returns. It reinforces the Christian belief in eternal life and the importance of faith in Christ.

Doesn’t Paul say that Jesus is coming before they who were alive at that time dies in Thessalonians 4? 
If Paul thought that Jesus was coming back in his lifetime, doesn’t that show you that he never met Jesus? 
15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

According to Paul's own words in 1 Thessalonians 4:15, he states, "We who are still alive," implying that he and those around him would remain alive until the coming of the Lord. Yet, Paul has died, and this event did not occur within his lifetime. This discrepancy points to what Deuteronomy 18:22 addresses—anyone who claims to speak "by the word of the Lord" and whose prophecy does not come to pass has not received that word from God.

Paul's statement is a clear example of a false prophecy. If one fears Paul, they will miss what scripture reveals about him. Jacob, in Genesis 49, described Benjamin as a ravenous wolf, and Jesus, in Matthew 7:15, warned about false prophets in sheep's clothing, likening them to ravenous wolves. These are the only two instances where 'ravenous wolf' appears, and they directly connect to Benjamin and Paul's identity.

Would God appoint a wolf to lead His flock? No, Jesus instructed Peter to feed His sheep, making Peter a hired hand rather than a true shepherd. But when the wolf (Paul) comes, what does the hired hand (Peter) do? He runs. This fits with the imagery of Peter Cottontail and the association with Easter, bunnies, and fleeing.

If you truly fear the Lord, you will recognize Paul for who he is—the ravenous wolf of Benjamin, boasting of his lineage as the "Benjamite of Benjamites" and calling himself the "chief of sinners." But scripture instructs us not to fear that false prophet. Deuteronomy 18 warns against prophets whose words do not come to pass, and we are commanded not to be afraid of them. This applies to Paul, whose words did not come from God.

A minor correction, it fits the imagery of Peter running away from his responsibility when Jesus was crucified. That's why I said the hired hand runs away. It just so happens that his name is Peter and we have nursery rhymes about Peter Cottontail and running like Peter Rabbit and stuff like that so I thought it was a little funny. And it relates us back to this false doctor, note, resurrection, and the bunnies that represent resurrection or fertility in fact, all connected back to the worship about not necessary to go into here

User clarified that their reference to Peter running relates to the imagery of Peter fleeing his responsibility during Jesus' crucifixion, symbolizing the hired hand running away. They added that the connection to Peter Cottontail and Peter Rabbit is humorous, relating to nursery rhymes and cultural symbols of bunnies connected to resurrection and fertility, tying back to their critique of resurrection doctrine.

Model set context updated.

Got it! The imagery of Peter running away during Jesus' crucifixion perfectly illustrates the idea of the hired hand fleeing when the wolf comes, connecting Peter to his failure in that moment. The humorous link to Peter Cottontail and other cultural symbols of running, bunnies, and resurrection ties neatly back to the broader critique of resurrection doctrine and its associations with fertility symbols. This brings out the subtle irony in how these symbols have permeated culture while distorting the original message.
