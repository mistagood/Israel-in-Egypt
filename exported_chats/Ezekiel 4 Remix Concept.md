# Ezekiel 4 Remix Concept



---

got a good sora video from this prompt: Ezekiel 4: the prophet has dreads and is a mystic looking man of color (think bob marleys teacher). He sits drawing on a large tile. As his stylus portrays the scene we see the city and the siege scene as described in Ezekiel 4 forming as he draws the lines until a complete tile sits before him.

Now I need the next part where he sits with his back to the tile with the iron pan. Im thinking to remix it

Great—you're already on a powerful visual trajectory with the Ezekiel 4 scene. Let's remix the next segment to build on the mysticism and prophetic gravity while keeping it visually engaging for your audience. Here's a cinematic and symbolic continuation you can direct into Sora:

---

**Prompt for Sora Animation (Remix of Ezekiel 4:3):**

The prophet, now cloaked in a linen mantle with dreadlocks slightly dusted from the desert wind, slowly rises and turns his back to the prophetic tile he has just inscribed. His expression is solemn, burdened, as if carrying the weight of generations.  

He walks toward an **iron pan**, glowing faintly in the twilight, and sets it down with sacred deliberation **between himself and the tile**. The camera angle dips low, rising slowly to frame the pan as a **barrier**—a shield, a wall of silence between heaven and earth.

We zoom in: the iron pan begins to shimmer. Etched visions flicker across its surface—armies, famine, chains, siege ramps. We see fire reflected in the prophet’s eyes. He sits down, his back to the city, staring into the distant sun. The tile glows faintly behind him.  

The wind picks up, carrying the dust of a fallen city. Time begins to warp—the pan becomes like a portal, reflecting past and future judgments, Babylonian soldiers fading into modern militarized forces. This is not just a siege of Jerusalem, but the siege of a people’s memory.

The prophet closes his eyes, hearing the Word in silence.

Would you like this segment to include text overlays of the original verse or a voiceover script for narration?

---

thats not gone work. too many changes. They never get that right

---

Understood. Let’s keep it literal and minimal for Sora so it renders correctly. Here's a clean, direct continuation of the original prompt that stays faithful to the scripture and visual language Sora handles well:

---

**Next Prompt for Sora (Ezekiel 4:3 continuation):**

The prophet, a dark-skinned man with dreadlocks and mystic presence, sits with his back to the large tile he just drew. The city and siege scene remain etched clearly on the tile. In front of him, he places an iron pan, upright like a shield, between himself and the tile.  

He stares forward, unmoving, with the iron pan standing as a barrier between him and the image of the city behind him. The sun casts long shadows. Dust swirls gently around him. The moment is still, tense, symbolic.

---

Would you like me to write the following sequence where he lies on his side for 390 days?

---

no i wanna get this right. Its supposed to have his back to it ? 

---

Yes — you're right to double-check. Ezekiel 4:3 says:

> *“Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city, and turn your face toward it so that it is under siege. Besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel.”* (NIV)

So actually — **his face is toward the tile**, not his back.

The iron pan is placed **between Ezekiel and the tile**, symbolizing a wall. He looks at the siege (the tile), not away from it.

Your instincts were correct to question that. So a corrected, literal prompt would be:

---

**Accurate Sora Prompt (Ezekiel 4:3):**

The prophet, a dark-skinned man with dreadlocks and a mystic presence, sits on the ground facing the large tile he has drawn. The city and siege scene are clearly visible on the tile in front of him.  

He lifts an iron pan and places it upright on the ground between himself and the tile, like a barrier. The pan stands as an iron wall.  

He stares through it, intently focused on the image of the besieged city, eyes steady and solemn. The wind is still. The message is clear.

---

Would you like to keep this purely static or animate the pan’s placement and Ezekiel’s posture shift?

---

its a remix of the prompt I gave

---

Got it — you want a **remix** of the original vibe (mystic, poetic, stylized) while staying **accurate** to Ezekiel 4:3. Here's the refined Sora-style prompt, remixing your tone but keeping the direction true:

---

**Remixed Sora Prompt (Ezekiel 4:3 – Stylized, Accurate):**

The prophet—dark-skinned, dreadlocked, wrapped in rough linen—sits before the tile he has drawn. His eyes are fixed on the image of the besieged city, lines still glowing faintly from his stylus.  

With deliberate movement, he reaches beside him and lifts a heavy iron pan. He places it upright in the sand between himself and the tile, forming a wall—an iron veil between prophet and vision.  

He leans forward, staring through the invisible barrier, unblinking, as the sun lowers behind the image of Jerusalem. His dreadlocks sway slightly in the wind. The tile, the pan, and the prophet form a triangle of tension.  

This is the siege. This is the sign.

Would you like the next sequence to begin with him lying on his left side for the 390 days? Or are we keeping the visuals episodic per verse?
