# Reducing audio hum



---



---

The noise level coming through here is like a loud hum. And it's coming through through the audio input cable. How can I reduce this sound? It sounds like it's not grounded well or that the audio is just picking up a hum. It's coming through. Or is this just a feature of this headphone jack because it's not very good?

That hum you’re hearing is almost certainly **ground loop or interference noise** coming in through the input side — not an inherent “feature” of the headphone amp itself. These inexpensive headphone distribution amps (like your Stabclo S-800) will happily amplify any noise that enters the system, which is why you hear it clearly. Here are the main things to check and try:

---

### 1. Check the Input Cable & Source
- **Cable quality**: Cheap or unshielded cables often pick up 60 Hz hum from nearby power cables, power supplies, or even your desk lamp. Swap it for a good, shielded TRS or XLR cable if possible.
- **Source device**: Plug headphones directly into your source (audio interface, mixer, etc.). If the hum disappears there, the issue is between source → headphone amp.
- **Balanced vs unbalanced**: If you’re feeding the amp with an unbalanced signal (TS cable, RCA, or ⅛”), it’s far more prone to hum. Use a balanced connection (TRS/XLR) if the amp and your interface/mixer both support it.

---

### 2. Ground Loop Issues
- **Different outlets**: If your headphone amp and your audio interface/computer are plugged into different wall outlets or power strips, a ground loop can form. Try plugging them into the same power strip.
- **Ground lift / isolator**: You may need a ground loop isolator or DI box with a ground lift switch on the input line if hum persists.
- **Laptop test**: If using a laptop, test running it on battery power. If the hum disappears when it’s unplugged, that’s a ground loop.

### 3. Power Supply
- These budget amps often come with noisy external power bricks. If the hum doesn’t change no matter what you plug into the input, the power supply itself could be the culprit. Replacing it with a higher-quality regulated 12V supply sometimes helps.

---

### 4. Gain Staging
- Run the **input source hotter** (louder) and keep the **amp’s channel levels lower**. That way, the signal-to-noise ratio is better, and hum/hiss won’t be boosted as much.

---

### 5. Eliminate Environmental Interference
- Keep audio cables away from power cables.
- Don’t run them parallel; if they must cross, do it at a 90° angle.
- Fluorescent lights, dimmers, and monitors can leak noise into audio systems.

✅ Quick diagnosis steps for you:
1. Disconnect the input cable completely. If the hum goes away → it’s the input side.
2. Swap input cables. If hum changes/disappears → it was the cable.
3. Run the input source on battery power or from the same outlet. If hum improves → ground loop.
4. If hum is still present even with no input cable, it’s likely the power supply brick.

Would you like me to walk you through **a step-by-step elimination test** (disconnecting/isolating each part one by one) so you can find out quickly whether this is a cable, ground loop, or power supply issue?
