WHo wrote about Elijah in the Bible

Elijah, a major figure in the Bible, is predominantly mentioned in the Books of Kings in the Old Testament. However, the authors of these texts are not definitively known. Traditionally, Jewish tradition attributes the authorship of the Books of Kings to the prophet Jeremiah, but modern scholars often view them as part of the Deuteronomistic History, a series of books (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) compiled from various sources by different authors and editors. These authors and editors, whose identities remain largely anonymous, likely worked during the Babylonian Exile (6th century BCE).

Any other prophets right about Elijah?

---

Yes, other prophets and biblical texts mention Elijah. Here are a few significant references:

1. **Malachi**: The last chapter of Malachi, another prophetical book of the Old Testament, makes a notable reference to Elijah. Malachi prophesies the return of Elijah before the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Malachi 4:5-6). This prophecy is significant in both Jewish and Christian eschatology.

2. **New Testament References**: In the New Testament, Elijah is frequently referred to, especially in the Gospels. Jesus Himself refers to Elijah in contexts like the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1–13, Mark 9:2–13, Luke 9:28–36) and in discussions with His disciples. Additionally, John the Baptist is associated with Elijah's prophesied return (Matthew 11:14, 17:12-13; Mark 9:11-13; Luke 1:17).

3. **Other Jewish Writings**: Elijah is also mentioned in other Jewish writings outside the canonical Hebrew Bible, such as in the Talmud and Midrash. These are not prophetic texts in the strict sense but do include interpretations and expansions on Elijah's role and stories.

In summary, while Elijah is primarily a figure in the Books of Kings, his influence and the traditions about him extend into other prophetic writings and the New Testament, signifying his importance in both Jewish and Christian traditions.

What’s the story of Elijah? I want you to go through the book of kings and break it down. Some will do this over a series of responses as a continual story.

Elijah's story in the Books of Kings is rich and multi-faceted, involving miracles, confrontations with kings, and profound moments of divine interaction. Here's a breakdown of his story, which I'll present over several responses:

1. **Introduction and the Drought (1 Kings 17:1-7)**: Elijah first appears in 1 Kings 17, where he confronts King Ahab of Israel and declares a drought as a punishment for the worship of Baal, a pagan god. God then directs Elijah to hide near the brook Cherith, where ravens bring him food.

2. **Miracle of the Widow’s Flour and Oil (1 Kings 17:8-16)**: As the brook dries up due to the drought, God sends Elijah to Zarephath, where he meets a widow. Elijah asks her for food, and though she has only a handful of flour and a little oil, Elijah promises that these supplies will not run out until the Lord sends rain upon the earth. Miraculously, her jar of flour and jug of oil do not become empty.

3. **Resurrection of the Widow’s Son (1 Kings 17:17-24)**: While staying with the widow, her son dies. Elijah prays to God and revives the boy, which strengthens the widow's faith in the Lord.

4. **Confrontation with the Prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18)**: Elijah challenges 450 prophets of Baal to a test on Mount Carmel to prove whose god is real. Both Elijah and the prophets of Baal prepare a bull for a sacrifice but do not set fire to it. The prophets of Baal call upon their god but receive no response. Elijah then calls upon the Lord, who sends fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice, proving His supremacy. Following this, Elijah orders the prophets of Baal to be seized and killed.

5. **Elijah Flees from Jezebel (1 Kings 19:1-3)**: After this victory, Queen Jezebel, a staunch supporter of Baal worship, threatens Elijah’s life. Fearing for his safety, Elijah flees into the wilderness.

This is the first part of Elijah's story. Let me know if you'd like to continue with the next segments!

Can you speak it to me

What verse said in Hebrew, his name is Abaddon

---

The verse that mentions "Abaddon" in Hebrew is found in the Book of Revelation, specifically Revelation 9:11. In this verse, "Abaddon" is referred to as the name of the angel of the abyss. The verse in English typically reads something like this:

"They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek, Apollyon."

It's important to note that while the name "Abaddon" is given in Hebrew, the Book of Revelation itself was originally written in Greek. This verse is part of a passage describing the release of locusts from the Abyss during the end times, as foretold in the apocalyptic vision of John.
