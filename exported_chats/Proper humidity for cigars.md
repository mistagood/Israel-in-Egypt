Proper humidity?

That’s a cigar humidor box. The little round gauge on the front is a **hygrometer**, which measures the relative humidity inside the box.  

For cigars, the *ideal humidity* range is **65–72%**, with **70%** often cited as the sweet spot. Temperatures should also stay around **68–70°F (20–21°C)**.  

If the hygrometer on your box reads below **60%**, your cigars are too dry and can lose flavor or crack. If it’s above **75%**, they risk mold or swelling.  

To keep the humidity proper:  
- Use a **humidification device or Boveda pack** inside the box.  
- Make sure the **seal closes tightly** when you shut the lid.  
- **Calibrate the hygrometer** if needed (many are off by 5–10%).  

If you tell me what your hygrometer currently reads, I can tell you whether it’s in range and what adjustment you might need.

I Just put the humidification device in after soaking it in distilled water. It’s just at 55 rn. But I’ll give it a minute

Perfect move. At 55%, you’re on the low side right now, but that’s completely normal just after setup. When you first season or recharge a humidor, it takes several hours — sometimes up to a full day — for the internal wood to absorb moisture and the humidity to stabilize.  

Here’s what’s happening:  
- The **Spanish cedar lining** inside the box is thirsty; it’s absorbing water vapor from your humidification device right now.  
- As the cedar becomes saturated, it’ll start *releasing* that moisture back into the air, and the reading will slowly climb.  
- You’ll probably see it settle between **65–70%** by tomorrow if your seal is tight.  

To help it along:  
- Keep the box **closed** during this process (every time you open it, you dump humidity).  
- Make sure the humidifier device isn’t dripping — just damp, not soaked.  
- If by tomorrow it’s still under 60%, you can place a **small dish of distilled water** inside (not touching cigars) overnight to speed seasoning.  

You’re doing it right. This is the “seasoning the wood” stage — the calm before your cigars live in tropical luxury.
