# Cosmic Symbols in Matthew



---



---

Will explore the book of Matthew as a book of cosmic symbols strictly. I’ll guide you verse by verse. Will start with Matthew 16. You create a side-by-side comparison for a commentary you will make sure my commentary is fluid and readable, as well as scholarly and insightful towards the mystic implications.
Inverse one, the traditional interpretation is that Jesus is asked to perform a miracle by the Pharisees an Sadducees. List the miracles Jesus has performed. Thus far in the book of math, threw up until the chapter 16. These show that the sign they were looking for was not a miracle, but rather the language suggests that they were looking for a sign in the sky. The Greek word ouranus (define) refers specifically to the room in the sky. Thus the entire discussion in the chapter initially centers upon a cosmological discussion and (an expected sign of Noah that should appear in the skies) rather tha one of Jesus performing miracles. This request from the Pharisees could stem from the ideas that the Messiah, and that Jehovah, or Yahweh rise upon the clouds of heaven, and demonstrates his glory through writing on clouds, historically, and traditionally. And the Pharisees could’ve been indicating that they were not excepting Jesus is miracles as proof of his Messiah ship, which could be the case since historically, there have been others who have claimed to be the Messiah during that time in history. Others were said to be the Messiah (insert historic example from Jesus time). So the Pharisees could’ve been indicating that they were looking for a higher form of proof, then the run-of-the-mill healing.

Certainly! Let's begin by creating a side-by-side comparison for a commentary on Matthew 16:1. 

| **Verse** | **Traditional Interpretation** | **Cosmic Symbols Interpretation** |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Matthew 16:1 | Jesus is asked by the Pharisees and Sadducees to perform a miracle as a sign of His divine authority. | The Pharisees and Sadducees are not merely asking for a miracle but are looking for a sign in the sky. The Greek word "ouranus" specifically refers to the realm in the sky. The discussion is centered on a cosmological sign, possibly the expected sign of Noah in the skies, rather than Jesus performing earthly miracles. |

**Commentary**:
The traditional interpretation of Matthew 16:1 is that the Pharisees and Sadducees are testing Jesus by asking Him to show them a sign from heaven. Up to this point in the Book of Matthew, Jesus has performed numerous miracles, including healing the sick, raising the dead, and feeding thousands with a few loaves and fish. These miracles, however, were not the "sign" the Pharisees and Sadducees were seeking.

The word "ouranus" in Greek, which is translated as "heaven," specifically refers to the realm in the sky. This suggests that the religious leaders were not looking for another miracle on earth but a cosmological sign in the heavens. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the expected sign of Noah would appear in the skies.

Historically, the concept of God or the Messiah appearing in the clouds and demonstrating glory has been a significant theme. For instance, in the Old Testament, Jehovah or Yahweh is often depicted as riding on the clouds, showcasing His majesty and power. This cosmic imagery might be what the Pharisees and Sadducees were alluding to. They could have been skeptical of Jesus' miracles as there were other figures during that time who claimed to be the Messiah. An example from that era is [Historic Example], who was also considered by some to be the Messiah. Given this context, the Pharisees and Sadducees might have been seeking a more profound, celestial sign as proof of Jesus' Messiahship, rather than the "ordinary" miracles He performed.
